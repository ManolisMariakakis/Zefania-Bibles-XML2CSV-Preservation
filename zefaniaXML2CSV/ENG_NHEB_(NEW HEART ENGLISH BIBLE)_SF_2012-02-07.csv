1,1,2,"Now the earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters."
1,1,3,"God said, Let there be light, and there was light."
1,1,4,"God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness."
1,1,5,"God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. There was evening and there was morning, one day."
1,1,6,"God said, Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
1,1,7,"God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so."
1,1,8,"God called the expanse sky. There was evening and there was morning, a second day."
1,1,9,"God said, Let the waters under the sky be gathered together in one gathering, and let the dry land appear; and it was so."
1,1,10,"God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas. God saw that it was good."
1,1,11,"God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth; and it was so."
1,1,12,"The earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good."
1,1,13,"There was evening and there was morning, a third day."
1,1,14,"God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;"
1,1,15,"and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth; and it was so."
1,1,16,"God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars."
1,1,17,"God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,"
1,1,18,"and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good."

1,1,23,"There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day."
1,1,24,"God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind; and it was so."
1,1,25,"God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good."
1,1,26,"God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
1,1,27,"God created man in his own image. In God's image he created him; male and female he created them."
1,1,28,"God blessed them. God said to them, Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth."
1,1,29,"God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food."
1,1,30,"To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food; and it was so."
1,1,31,"God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day."
1,2,1,"The heavens and the earth were finished, and all their vast array."
1,2,2,"On the sixth day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made."

1,3,4,"The serpent said to the woman, You won't surely die,"
1,3,5,"for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
1,3,6,"When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and ate; and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate."

1,8,6,"It happened at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made,"
1,8,7,"and he sent forth a raven. It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth."
1,8,8,"He sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground,"
1,8,9,"but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned to him into the ship; for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. He put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship."
1,8,10,"He stayed yet another seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ship."
1,8,11,"The dove came back to him at evening, and, behold, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth."
1,8,12,"He stayed yet another seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she did not return to him any more."
1,8,13,"It happened in the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dried."
1,8,14,"In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry."
1,8,15,"God spoke to Noah, saying,"

1,9,2,"The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky. Everything that the ground teems with, and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand."
1,9,3,"Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As the green herb, I have given everything to you."
1,9,4,"But flesh with its life, its blood, you shall not eat."
1,9,5,"I will surely require your blood of your lives. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, I will require the life of man."
1,9,6,"Whoever sheds man's blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own image."
1,9,7,"Be fruitful and multiply. Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it."
1,9,8,"God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,"

1,9,10,"and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth."
1,9,11,"I will establish my covenant with you: all flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood, neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth."
1,9,12,"God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:"
1,9,13,"I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth."
1,9,14,"It will happen, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,"
1,9,15,"and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh."
1,9,16,"The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."
1,9,17,"God said to Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."
1,9,18,"The sons of Noah who went forth from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the father of Canaan."

1,13,7,"There was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time."
1,13,8,"Abram said to Lot, Please, let there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we are relatives."
1,13,9,"Isn't the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left."

1,14,4,"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year, they rebelled."
1,14,5,"In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who were with him, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,"
1,14,6,"and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness."
1,14,7,"They returned, and came to En Mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon Tamar."
1,14,8,"The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim;"
1,14,9,"against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five."
1,14,10,"Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and those who remained fled to the hills."
1,14,11,"They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way."
1,14,12,"They took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed."
1,14,13,"One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew. Now he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were allies of Abram."
1,14,14,"When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan."
1,14,15,"He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus."
1,14,16,"He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative, Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people."
1,14,17,"The king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley)."
1,14,18,"Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High."
1,14,19,"He blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:"
1,14,20,"and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.Abram gave him a tenth of all."
1,14,21,"The king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the people, and take the goods to yourself."
1,14,22,"Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand to the"
1,14,23,"that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, 'I have made Abram rich.'"
1,14,24,"I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion."
1,15,1,"After these things the word of the"

1,15,11,"The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away."
1,15,12,"When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on him."
1,15,13,"He said to Abram, Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years."
1,15,14,"I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth,"
1,15,15,"but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried in a good old age."
1,15,16,"In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full."
1,15,17,"It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch passed between these pieces."

1,16,1,"Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar."
1,16,2,"Sarai said to Abram, See now, the"
1,16,3,"Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife."
1,16,4,"He went in to Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes."
1,16,5,"Sarai said to Abram, This wrong is your fault. I gave my handmaid into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. The"
1,16,6,"But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, your maid is in your hand. Do to her whatever is good in your eyes. Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face."
1,16,7,"The angel of the"
1,16,8,"He said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, where did you come from? Where are you going?She said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai."

1,16,15,"Hagar bore a son for Abram. Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael."

1,17,1,"When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the"
1,17,2,"I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly."
1,17,3,"Abram fell on his face. God talked with him, saying,"
1,17,4,"As for me, behold, my covenant is with you. You will be the father of a multitude of nations."
1,17,5,"Neither will your name any more be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations."
1,17,6,"I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Kings will come out of you."
1,17,7,"I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your seed after you."
1,17,8,"I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. I will be their God."
1,17,9,"God said to Abraham, As for you, you will keep my covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations."
1,17,10,"This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your seed after you. Every male among you shall be circumcised."
1,17,11,"You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin. It will be a token of the covenant between me and you."
1,17,12,"He who is eight days old will be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he who is born in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your seed."
1,17,13,"He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money, must be circumcised. My covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant."
1,17,14,"The uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant."
1,17,15,"God said to Abraham, As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but her name will be Sarah."
1,17,16,"I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. Yes, I will bless her, and she will be a mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come from her."
1,17,17,"Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old? Will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?"
1,17,18,"Abraham said to God, Oh that Ishmael might live before you!"
1,17,19,"God said, No, but Sarah, your wife, will bear you a son. You shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him."
1,17,20,"As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation."
1,17,21,"But my covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year."
1,17,22,"When he finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham."
1,17,23,"Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money; every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him."
1,17,24,"Abraham was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
1,17,25,"Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
1,17,26,"In the same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were circumcised."
1,17,27,"All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him."
1,18,1,"The"
1,18,2,"He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men stood opposite him. When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,"
1,18,3,"and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please do not go away from your servant."
1,18,4,"Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree."
1,18,5,"I will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant.They said, Very well, do as you have said."
1,18,6,"Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, Quickly make ready three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes."
1,18,7,"Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to dress it."
1,18,8,"He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree, and they ate."
1,18,9,"They said to him, Where is Sarah, your wife?He said, See, in the tent."
1,18,10,"Then he said, I will certainly return to you when the season comes round. Behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him."
1,18,11,"Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. It had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women."
1,18,12,"Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
1,18,13,"The"
1,18,14,"Is anything too hard for the"
1,18,15,"Then Sarah denied, saying, I did not laugh, for she was afraid.He said, No, but you did laugh."
1,18,16,"The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way."
1,18,17,"The"
1,18,18,"seeing that Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?"
1,18,19,"For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the"
1,18,20,"The"
1,18,21,"I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know."
1,18,22,"The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before the"
1,18,23,"Abraham drew near, and said, Will you consume the righteous with the wicked?"
1,18,24,"What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?"
1,18,25,"Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn't the Judge of all the earth do right?"
1,18,26,"The"
1,18,27,"Abraham answered, See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord, who am but dust and ashes."
1,18,28,"What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?He said, I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there."
1,18,29,"He spoke to him yet again, and said, What if there are forty found there?He said, I will not do it for the forty's sake."
1,18,30,"He said, Oh do not let the Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there?He said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
1,18,31,"He said, See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord. What if there are twenty found there?He said, I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake."
1,18,32,"He said, Oh do not let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?He said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake."
1,18,33,"The"
1,19,1,"The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth,"
1,19,2,"and he said, See now, my lords, please turn aside into your servant's house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you will rise up early, and go on your way.They said, No, but we will stay in the street all night."
1,19,3,"He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate."
1,19,4,"But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter."
1,19,5,"They called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them."
1,19,6,"Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him."
1,19,7,"He said, Please, my brothers, do not act so wickedly."
1,19,8,"See now, I have two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only do not do anything to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof."
1,19,9,"They said, Stand back! They said, This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now will we deal worse with you, than with them! They pressed hard on the man Lot, and drew near to break the door."
1,19,10,"But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door."
1,19,11,"They struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door."
1,19,12,"The men said to Lot, Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:"
1,19,13,"for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before the"

1,19,15,"When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, Get up! Take your wife, and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
1,19,16,"But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife's hand, and his two daughters' hands, the"
1,19,17,"It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, and do not stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!"
1,19,18,"Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my lord."
1,19,19,"See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can't escape to the mountain, lest the disaster overtake me, and I die."
1,19,20,"See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn't it a little one?), and my soul will live."
1,19,21,"He said to him, Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken."
1,19,22,"Hurry, escape there, for I can't do anything until you get there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar."
1,19,23,"The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar."
1,19,24,"Then the"
1,19,25,"He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground."
1,19,26,"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
1,19,27,"Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the"
1,19,28,"He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace."
1,19,29,"It happened, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived."
1,19,30,"Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters."
1,19,31,"The firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth."
1,19,32,"Come, let's make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father's seed."
1,19,33,"They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down, nor when she arose."
1,19,34,"It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine again, tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve our father's seed."
1,19,35,"They made their father drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He did not know when she lay down, nor when she got up."
1,19,36,"Thus both of Lot's daughters were with child by their father."
1,19,37,"The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day."
1,19,38,"The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of Ammon to this day."
1,20,1,"Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the Negev, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He lived as a foreigner in Gerar."
1,20,2,"Abraham said about Sarah his wife, She is my sister. Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah."
1,20,3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken. For she is a man's wife."
1,20,4,"Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?"
1,20,5,"Did not he tell me, 'She is my sister?' She, even she herself, said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have I done this."
1,20,6,"God said to him in the dream, Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not allow you to touch her."
1,20,7,"Now therefore, restore the man's wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you do not restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours."
1,20,8,"Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared."
1,20,9,"Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!"
1,20,10,"Abimelech said to Abraham, What did you see, that you have done this thing?"
1,20,11,"Abraham said, Because I thought, 'Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife's sake.'"
1,20,12,"Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."
1,20,13,"It happened, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, 'This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, He is my brother.'"
1,20,14,"Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him."
1,20,15,"Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you."
1,20,16,"To Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated."
1,20,17,"Abraham prayed to God. God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children."
1,20,18,"For the"
1,21,1,"The"
1,21,2,"Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him."
1,21,3,"Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac."
1,21,4,"Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him."
1,21,5,"Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac, was born to him."
1,21,6,"Sarah said, God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me."
1,21,7,"She said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in his old age."
1,21,8,"The child grew, and was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned."
1,21,9,"Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking."
1,21,10,"Therefore she said to Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son! For the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son, Isaac."
1,21,11,"The thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son."
1,21,12,"God said to Abraham, Do not let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your handmaid. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For from Isaac will your seed be called."
1,21,13,"I will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid, because he is your seed."
1,21,14,"Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba."
1,21,15,"The water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs."
1,21,16,"She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, Do not let me see the death of the child. She sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept."
1,21,17,"God heard the voice of the boy.The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, What ails you, Hagar? Do not be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy where he is."
1,21,18,"Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand. For I will make him a great nation."
1,21,19,"God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the bottle with water, and gave the boy drink."
1,21,20,"God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer."
1,21,21,"He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt."
1,21,22,"It happened at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do."
1,21,23,"Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner."
1,21,24,"Abraham said, I will swear."
1,21,25,"Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away."
1,21,26,"Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this thing. Neither did you tell me, neither did I hear of it, until today."
1,21,27,"Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant."
1,21,28,"Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves."
1,21,29,"Abimelech said to Abraham, What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean?"
1,21,30,"He said, You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well."
1,21,31,"Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because they both swore there."
1,21,32,"So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines."
1,21,33,"Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the"
1,21,34,"Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days."
1,22,1,"It happened after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, Abraham!He said, Here I am."
1,22,2,"He said, Now take your son, your only son, whom you love, even Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah. Offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of."
1,22,3,"Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him."
1,22,4,"On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off."
1,22,5,"Abraham said to his young men, Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go yonder. We will worship, and come back to you."
1,22,6,"Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the knife. They both went together."
1,22,7,"Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father?He said, Here I am, my son.He said, Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
1,22,8,"Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son. So they both went together."
1,22,9,"They came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood."
1,22,10,"Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to kill his son."
1,22,11,"The angel of the"
1,22,12,"He said, Do not lay your hand on the boy, neither do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me."
1,22,13,"Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son."
1,22,14,"Abraham called the name of that place the"
1,22,15,"The angel of the"
1,22,16,"and said, I have sworn by myself, says the"
1,22,17,"that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your seed will possess the gate of his enemies."
1,22,18,"In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice."
1,22,19,"So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba."
1,22,20,"It happened after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother Nahor:"
1,22,21,"Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,"
1,22,22,"Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
1,22,23,"Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother."
1,22,24,"His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah."
1,23,1,"Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years. This was the length of Sarah's life."
1,23,2,"Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her."
1,23,3,"Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children of Heth, saying,"
1,23,4,"I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
1,23,5,"The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,"
1,23,6,"Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead."
1,23,7,"Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth."
1,23,8,"He talked with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,"
1,23,9,"that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a burying-place."
1,23,10,"Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,"
1,23,11,"No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead."
1,23,12,"Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land."
1,23,13,"He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there."
1,23,14,"Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,"
1,23,15,"My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you? Therefore bury your dead."
1,23,16,"Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants' standard."
1,23,17,"So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deeded"
1,23,18,"to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city."
1,23,19,"After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan."
1,23,20,"The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth."
1,24,1,"Abraham was old, and well stricken in age. The"
1,24,2,"Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, Please put your hand under my thigh."
1,24,3,"I will make you swear by the"
1,24,4,"But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac."
1,24,5,"The servant said to him, What if the woman isn't willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your son again to the land you came from?"
1,24,6,"Abraham said to him, Beware that you do not bring my son there again."
1,24,7,"The"
1,24,8,"If the woman isn't willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath. Only you shall not bring my son there again."
1,24,9,"The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter."
1,24,10,"The servant took ten camels, of his master's camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of his master's with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor."
1,24,11,"He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water."
1,24,12,"He said, O"
1,24,13,"Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water."
1,24,14,"Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, 'Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,' and she will say, 'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,'-let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master."
1,24,15,"It happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder."
1,24,16,"The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin, neither had any man known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up."
1,24,17,"The servant ran to meet her, and said, Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher."
1,24,18,"She said, Drink, my lord. She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him drink."
1,24,19,"When she had done giving him drink, she said, I will also draw for your camels, until they have done drinking."
1,24,20,"She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels."
1,24,21,"The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether the"
1,24,22,"It happened, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,"
1,24,23,"and said, Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?"
1,24,24,"She said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."
1,24,25,"She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in."
1,24,26,"The man bowed his head, and worshiped the"
1,24,27,"He said, Blessed be the"
1,24,28,"The young lady ran, and told her mother's house about these words."
1,24,29,"Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring."
1,24,30,"It happened, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, This is what the man said to me, that he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring."
1,24,31,"He said, Come in, you blessed of the"
1,24,32,"The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him."
1,24,33,"Food was set before him to eat, but he said, I will not eat until I have told my message.He said, Speak on."
1,24,34,"He said, I am Abraham's servant."
1,24,35,"The"
1,24,36,"Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he has to him."
1,24,37,"My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,"
1,24,38,"but you shall go to my father's house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.'"
1,24,39,"I said to my master, 'What if the woman will not follow me?'"
1,24,40,"He said to me, 'The"
1,24,41,"Then will you be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they do not give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.'"
1,24,42,"I came this day to the spring, and said, 'The"
1,24,43,"behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes forth to draw, to whom I will say, Give me, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher to drink,"
1,24,44,"and she will tell me, Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,-let her be the woman whom the"
1,24,45,"Before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'"
1,24,46,"She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, 'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.' So I drank, and she made the camels drink also."
1,24,47,"I asked her, and said, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.' I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands."
1,24,48,"I bowed my head, and worshiped the"
1,24,49,"Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
1,24,50,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered, The thing proceeds from the"
1,24,51,"Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as the"
1,24,52,"It happened that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to the"
1,24,53,"The servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and her mother."
1,24,54,"They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master."
1,24,55,"Her brother and her mother said, Let the young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that she will go."
1,24,56,"He said to them, Do not hinder me, seeing the"
1,24,57,"They said, We will call the young lady, and ask her."
1,24,58,"They called Rebekah, and said to her, Will you go with this man?She said, I will go."
1,24,59,"They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham's servant, and his men."
1,24,60,"They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them."
1,24,61,"Rebekah arose with her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah, and went his way."
1,24,62,"Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of the Negev."
1,24,63,"Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming."
1,24,64,"Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel."
1,24,65,"She said to the servant, Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?The servant said, It is my master.She took her veil, and covered herself."
1,24,66,"The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done."
1,24,67,"Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. He loved her. Isaac was comforted after his mother's death."
1,25,1,"Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah."
1,25,2,"She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah."
1,25,3,"Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim."
1,25,4,"The sons of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah."
1,25,5,"Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,"
1,25,6,"but to the sons of Abraham's concubines, Abraham gave gifts. He sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country."
1,25,7,"These are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years."
1,25,8,"Abraham gave up the spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people."
1,25,9,"Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre,"
1,25,10,"the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife."
1,25,11,"It happened after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi."
1,25,12,"Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham."
1,25,13,"These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,"
1,25,14,"Mishma, Dumah, Massa,"
1,25,15,"Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah."
1,25,16,"These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations."
1,25,17,"These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up the spirit and died, and was gathered to his people."
1,25,18,"They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives."
1,25,19,"This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham became the father of Isaac."
1,25,20,"Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife."
1,25,21,"Isaac entreated the"
1,25,22,"The children struggled together within her. She said, If it be so, why do I live? She went to inquire of the"
1,25,23,"The"
1,25,24,"When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb."
1,25,25,"The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau."
1,25,26,"After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them."
1,25,27,"The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents."
1,25,28,"Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob."
1,25,29,"Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished."
1,25,30,"Esau said to Jacob, Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished. Therefore his name was called Edom."
1,25,31,"Jacob said, First, sell me your birthright."
1,25,32,"Esau said, Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?"
1,25,33,"Jacob said, Swear to me first.He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob."
1,25,34,"Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright."
1,26,1,"There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar."
1,26,2,"The"
1,26,3,"Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father."
1,26,4,"I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will give to your seed all these lands. In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed,"
1,26,5,"because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
1,26,6,"Isaac lived in Gerar."
1,26,7,"The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, She is my sister, for he was afraid to say, My wife, lest, he thought, the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at."
1,26,8,"It happened, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife."
1,26,9,"Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, 'She is my sister?'Isaac said to him, Because I said, 'Lest I die because of her.'"
1,26,10,"Abimelech said, What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!"
1,26,11,"Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death."
1,26,12,"Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. The"
1,26,13,"The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great."
1,26,14,"He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him."
1,26,15,"Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth."
1,26,16,"Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us, for you are much mightier than we."
1,26,17,"Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there."
1,26,18,"Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them."
1,26,19,"Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water."
1,26,20,"The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. He called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him."
1,26,21,"They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. He called its name Sitnah."
1,26,22,"He left that place, and dug another well. They did not argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth. He said, For now the"
1,26,23,"He went up from there to Beersheba."
1,26,24,"The"
1,26,25,"He built an altar there, and called on the name of the"
1,26,26,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army."
1,26,27,"Isaac said to them, Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
1,26,28,"They said, We saw plainly that the"
1,26,29,"that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.' You are now the blessed of the"
1,26,30,"He made them a feast, and they ate and drank."
1,26,31,"They rose up some time in the morning, and swore one to another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace."
1,26,32,"It happened the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, We have found water."
1,26,33,"He called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day."
1,26,34,"When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite."
1,26,35,"They grieved Isaac's and Rebekah's spirits."
1,27,1,"It happened, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, My son?He said to him, Here I am."
1,27,2,"He said, See now, I am old. I do not know the day of my death."
1,27,3,"Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison."
1,27,4,"Make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die."
1,27,5,"Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it."
1,27,6,"Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,"
1,27,7,"'Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before the"
1,27,8,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you."
1,27,9,"Go now to the flock, and get me from there two good kids of the goats. I will make them savory food for your father, such as he loves."
1,27,10,"You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death."
1,27,11,"Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man."
1,27,12,"What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing."
1,27,13,"His mother said to him, Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me."
1,27,14,"He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father loved."
1,27,15,"Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son."
1,27,16,"She put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck."
1,27,17,"She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob."
1,27,18,"He came to his father, and said, My father?He said, Here I am. Who are you, my son?"
1,27,19,"Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me."
1,27,20,"Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?He said, Because the"
1,27,21,"Isaac said to Jacob, Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not."
1,27,22,"Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
1,27,23,"He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau's hands. So he blessed him."
1,27,24,"He said, Are you really my son Esau?He said, I am."
1,27,25,"He said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless you.He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he drank."
1,27,26,"His father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son."
1,27,27,"He came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said,Behold, the smell of my sonis as the smell of a field which the"
1,27,28,"God give you of the dew of the sky,of the fatness of the earth,and plenty of grain and new wine."
1,27,29,"Let peoples serve you,and nations bow down to you.Be lord over your brothers.Let your mother's sons bow down to you.Cursed be everyone who curses you.Blessed be everyone who blesses you."
1,27,30,"It happened, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
1,27,31,"He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that your soul may bless me."
1,27,32,"Isaac his father said to him, Who are you?He said, I am your son, your firstborn, Esau."
1,27,33,"Isaac trembled violently, and said, Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? Yes, he will be blessed."
1,27,34,"When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, my father."
1,27,35,"He said, Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing."
1,27,36,"He said, Isn't he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing. He said, Haven't you reserved a blessing for me?"
1,27,37,"Isaac answered Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants. With grain and new wine have I sustained him. What then will I do for you, my son?"
1,27,38,"Esau said to his father, Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father. Esau lifted up his voice, and wept."
1,27,39,"Isaac his father answered him,Behold, of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling,and of the dew of the sky from above."
1,27,40,"By your sword will you live, and you will serve your brother.It will happen, when you will break loose,that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck."
1,27,41,"Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob."
1,27,42,"The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you."
1,27,43,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran."
1,27,44,"Stay with him a few days, until your brother's fury turns away;"
1,27,45,"until your brother's anger turn away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?"
1,27,46,"Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?"
1,28,1,"Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
1,28,2,"Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father. Take a wife from there from the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother."
1,28,3,"May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples,"
1,28,4,"and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham."
1,28,5,"Isaac sent Jacob away. He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, Rebekah's brother, Jacob's and Esau's mother."
1,28,6,"Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,"
1,28,7,"and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram."
1,28,8,"Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan did not please Isaac, his father."
1,28,9,"Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife."
1,28,10,"Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran."
1,28,11,"He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep."
1,28,12,"He dreamed. Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven. Behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it."
1,28,13,"Behold, the"
1,28,14,"Your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed."
1,28,15,"Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken of to you."
1,28,16,"Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the"
1,28,17,"He was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! This is none other than God's house, and this is the gate of heaven."
1,28,18,"Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top."
1,28,19,"He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first."
1,28,20,"Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on,"
1,28,21,"so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and the"
1,28,22,"then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God's house. Of all that you will give me I will surely give the tenth to you."
1,29,1,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east."
1,29,2,"He looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well's mouth was large."
1,29,3,"There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well's mouth in its place."
1,29,4,"Jacob said to them, My relatives, where are you from?They said, We are from Haran."
1,29,5,"He said to them, Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?They said, We know him."
1,29,6,"He said to them, Is it well with him?They said, It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep."
1,29,7,"He said, Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them."
1,29,8,"They said, We can't, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep."
1,29,9,"While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she kept them."
1,29,10,"It happened, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother."
1,29,11,"Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept."
1,29,12,"Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son. She ran and told her father."
1,29,13,"It happened, when Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister's son, that he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things."
1,29,14,"Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. He lived with him for a month."
1,29,15,"Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?"
1,29,16,"Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
1,29,17,"Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive."
1,29,18,"Jacob loved Rachel. He said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter."
1,29,19,"Laban said, It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me."
1,29,20,"Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her."
1,29,21,"Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her."
1,29,22,"Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast."
1,29,23,"It happened in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. He went in to her."
1,29,24,"Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid."
1,29,25,"It happened in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. He said to Laban, What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?"
1,29,26,"Laban said, It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn."
1,29,27,"Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years."
1,29,28,"Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife."
1,29,29,"Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her handmaid."
1,29,30,"He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years."
1,29,31,"The"
1,29,32,"Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said, Because the"
1,29,33,"She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, Because the"
1,29,34,"She conceived again, and bore a son. Said, Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore was his name called Levi."
1,29,35,"She conceived again, and bore a son. She said, This time will I praise the"
1,30,1,"When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister. She said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I will die."
1,30,2,"Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, Am I in God's place, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"
1,30,3,"She said, Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her."
1,30,4,"She gave him Bilhah her handmaid as wife, and Jacob went in to her."
1,30,5,"Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son."
1,30,6,"Rachel said, God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son. Therefore called she his name Dan."
1,30,7,"Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son."
1,30,8,"Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed. She named him Naphtali."
1,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob as a wife."
1,30,10,"Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore Jacob a son."
1,30,11,"Leah said, How fortunate! She named him Gad."
1,30,12,"Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore Jacob a second son."
1,30,13,"Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy. She named him Asher."
1,30,14,"Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
1,30,15,"She said to her, Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes, also?Rachel said, Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes."
1,30,16,"Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son's mandrakes.He lay with her that night."
1,30,17,"God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son."
1,30,18,"Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband. She named him Issachar."
1,30,19,"Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob."
1,30,20,"Leah said, God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons. She named him Zebulun."
1,30,21,"Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah."
1,30,22,"God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb."
1,30,23,"She conceived, bore a son, and said, God has taken away my reproach."
1,30,24,"She named him Joseph, saying, May the"
1,30,25,"It happened, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country."
1,30,26,"Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you."
1,30,27,"Laban said to him, If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that the"
1,30,28,"He said, Appoint me your wages, and I will give it."
1,30,29,"He said to him, You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me."
1,30,30,"For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. The"
1,30,31,"He said, What shall I give you?Jacob said, You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it."
1,30,32,"I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This will be my hire."
1,30,33,"So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be counted stolen."
1,30,34,"Laban said, Behold, I desire it to be according to your word."
1,30,35,"That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons."
1,30,36,"He set three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks."
1,30,37,"Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods."
1,30,38,"He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink."
1,30,39,"The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted."
1,30,40,"Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and did not put them into Laban's flock."
1,30,41,"It happened, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;"
1,30,42,"but when the flock were feeble, he did not put them in. So the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's."
1,30,43,"The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys."
1,31,1,"He heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father's. From that which was our father's, has he gotten all this wealth."
1,31,2,"Jacob saw the expression on Laban's face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before."
1,31,3,"The"
1,31,4,"Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,"
1,31,5,"and said to them, I see the expression on your father's face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me."
1,31,6,"You know that I have served your father with all of my strength."
1,31,7,"Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God did not allow him to hurt me."
1,31,8,"If he said this, 'The speckled will be your wages,' then all the flock bore speckled. If he said this, 'The streaked will be your wages,' then all the flock bore streaked."
1,31,9,"Thus God has taken away your father's livestock, and given them to me."
1,31,10,"It happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled."
1,31,11,"The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am.'"
1,31,12,"He said, 'Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you."
1,31,13,"I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.'"
1,31,14,"Rachel and Leah answered him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?"
1,31,15,"Aren't we accounted by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money."
1,31,16,"For all the riches which God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do."
1,31,17,"Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,"
1,31,18,"and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan."
1,31,19,"Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's."
1,31,20,"Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he did not tell him that he was running away."
1,31,21,"So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead."
1,31,22,"Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled."
1,31,23,"He took his relatives with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey. He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead."
1,31,24,"God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said to him, Take heed to yourself that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad."
1,31,25,"Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead."
1,31,26,"Laban said to Jacob, What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?"
1,31,27,"Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and did not tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;"
1,31,28,"and did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly."
1,31,29,"It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Take heed to yourself that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.'"
1,31,30,"Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father's house, but why have you stolen my gods?"
1,31,31,"Jacob answered Laban, Because I was afraid, for I said, 'Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.'"
1,31,32,"Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it. For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them."
1,31,33,"Laban went into Jacob's tent, into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he did not find them. He went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent."
1,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel's saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt about all the tent, but did not find them."
1,31,35,"She said to her father, Do not let my lord be angry that I can't rise up before you; for the manner of women is on me. He searched, but did not find the teraphim."
1,31,36,"Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?"
1,31,37,"Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two."
1,31,38,"These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven't eaten the rams of your flocks."
1,31,39,"That which was torn of animals, I did not bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night."
1,31,40,"This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes."
1,31,41,"These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times."
1,31,42,"Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night."
1,31,43,"Laban answered Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?"
1,31,44,"Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you."
1,31,45,"Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar."
1,31,46,"Jacob said to his relatives, Gather stones. They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap."
1,31,47,"Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed."
1,31,48,"Laban said, This heap is witness between me and you this day. Therefore it was named Galeed"
1,31,49,"and Mizpah, for he said, The"
1,31,50,"If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you."
1,31,51,"Laban said to Jacob, See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you."
1,31,52,"May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm."
1,31,53,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac."
1,31,54,"Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain."
1,31,55,"Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place."
1,32,1,"Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him."
1,32,2,"When he saw them, Jacob said, This is God's army. He called the name of that place Mahanaim."
1,32,3,"Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom."
1,32,4,"He commanded them, saying, This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: 'This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now."
1,32,5,"I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.'"
1,32,6,"The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau. Not only that, but he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him."
1,32,7,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;"
1,32,8,"and he said, If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape."
1,32,9,"Jacob said, God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the"
1,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies."
1,32,11,"Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers with the children."
1,32,12,"You said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which can't be numbered because there are so many.'"
1,32,13,"He lodged there that night, and took from that which he had with him, a present for Esau, his brother:"
1,32,14,"two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,"
1,32,15,"thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals."
1,32,16,"He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd."
1,32,17,"He commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, 'Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?'"
1,32,18,"Then you shall say, 'They are your servant, Jacob's. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.'"
1,32,19,"He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him."
1,32,20,"You shall say, 'Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.' For, he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me."
1,32,21,"So the present passed over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the camp."
1,32,22,"He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok."
1,32,23,"He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had."
1,32,24,"Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day."
1,32,25,"When he saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled."
1,32,26,"The man said, Let me go, for the day breaks.Jacob said, I won't let you go, unless you bless me."
1,32,27,"He said to him, What is your name?He said, Jacob."
1,32,28,"He said, Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed."
1,32,29,"Jacob asked him, Please tell me your name.He said, Why is it that you ask what my name is? He blessed him there."
1,32,30,"Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, he said, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."
1,32,31,"The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh."
1,32,32,"Therefore the children of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip."
1,33,1,"Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two handmaids."
1,33,2,"He put the handmaids and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear."
1,33,3,"He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother."
1,33,4,"Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept."
1,33,5,"He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with you?He said, The children whom God has graciously given your servant."
1,33,6,"Then the handmaids came near with their children, and they bowed themselves."
1,33,7,"Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves."
1,33,8,"Esau said, What do you mean by all this company which I met?Jacob said, To find favor in the sight of my lord."
1,33,9,"Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours."
1,33,10,"Jacob said, Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me."
1,33,11,"Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. He urged him, and he took it."
1,33,12,"Esau said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you."
1,33,13,"Jacob said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die."
1,33,14,"Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir."
1,33,15,"Esau said, Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me.He said, Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord."
1,33,16,"So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir."
1,33,17,"Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
1,33,18,"Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city."
1,33,19,"He bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for one hundred pieces of money."
1,33,20,"He erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel."
1,34,1,"Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
1,34,2,"Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her."
1,34,3,"His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady."
1,34,4,"Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, Get me this young lady as a wife."
1,34,5,"Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came."
1,34,6,"Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him."
1,34,7,"The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; a which thing ought not to be done."
1,34,8,"Hamor talked with them, saying, The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife."
1,34,9,"Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves."
1,34,10,"You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it."
1,34,11,"Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give."
1,34,12,"Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife."
1,34,13,"The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,"
1,34,14,"and said to them, We can't do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us."
1,34,15,"Only on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;"
1,34,16,"then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people."
1,34,17,"But if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised, then we will take our sister, and we will be gone."
1,34,18,"Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son."
1,34,19,"The young man did not wait to do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter, and he was honored above all the house of his father."
1,34,20,"Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying,"
1,34,21,"These men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters."
1,34,22,"Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised."
1,34,23,"Won't their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let us give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us."
1,34,24,"All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city."
1,34,25,"It happened on the third day, when they were sore, that two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the males."
1,34,26,"They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went away."
1,34,27,"Jacob's sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister."
1,34,28,"They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field,"
1,34,29,"and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house."
1,34,30,"Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house."
1,34,31,"They said, Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?"
1,35,1,"God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother."
1,35,2,"Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments."
1,35,3,"Let us arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."
1,35,4,"They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem."
1,35,5,"They traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob."
1,35,6,"So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him."
1,35,7,"He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother."
1,35,8,"Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called Allon Bacuth."
1,35,9,"God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him."
1,35,10,"God said to him, Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel. He named him Israel."
1,35,11,"God said to him, I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your body."
1,35,12,"The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your seed after you will I give the land."
1,35,13,"God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him."
1,35,14,"Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it."
1,35,15,"Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him Bethel."
1,35,16,"They traveled from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed. She had hard labor."
1,35,17,"When she was in hard labor, the midwife said to her, Do not be afraid, for now you will have another son."
1,35,18,"It happened, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him Benoni, but his father named him Benjamin."
1,35,19,"Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem)."
1,35,20,"Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave to this day."
1,35,21,"Israel traveled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder."
1,35,22,"It happened, while Israel lived in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard of it.Now the sons of Jacob were twelve."
1,35,23,"The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun."
1,35,24,"The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin."
1,35,25,"The sons of Bilhah (Rachel's handmaid): Dan and Naphtali."
1,35,26,"The sons of Zilpah (Leah's handmaid): Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram."
1,35,27,"Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac lived as foreigners."
1,35,28,"The days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years."
1,35,29,"Isaac gave up the spirit, and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him."
1,36,1,"Now this is the history of the generations of Esau (that is, Edom)."
1,36,2,"Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon, the Hittite; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, the Hivite;"
1,36,3,"and Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth."
1,36,4,"Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz. Basemath bore Reuel."
1,36,5,"Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan."
1,36,6,"Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, with his livestock, all his animals, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from his brother Jacob."
1,36,7,"For their substance was too great for them to dwell together, and the land of their travels couldn't bear them because of their livestock."
1,36,8,"Esau lived in the hill country of Seir. Esau is Edom."
1,36,9,"This is the history of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir:"
1,36,10,"these are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, the wife of Esau; and Reuel, the son of Basemath, the wife of Esau."
1,36,11,"The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz."
1,36,12,"Timna was concubine to Eliphaz, Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek. These are the sons of Adah, Esau's wife."
1,36,13,"These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife."
1,36,14,"These were the sons of Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: she bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah."

1,36,19,"These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs."
1,36,20,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,"
1,36,21,"Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs who came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom."
1,36,22,"The children of Lotan were Hori and Heman. Lotan's sister was Timna."
1,36,23,"These are the children of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam."
1,36,24,"These are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father."
1,36,25,"These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah."
1,36,26,"These are the children of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran."

1,36,29,"These are the chiefs who came of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,"
1,36,30,"chief Dishon, chief Ezer, and chief Dishan: these are the chiefs who came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir."
1,36,31,"These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom, before any king reigned over the children of Israel."
1,36,32,"Bela, the son of Beor, reigned in Edom. The name of his city was Dinhabah."
1,36,33,"Bela died, and Jobab, the son of Zerah of Bozrah, reigned in his place."
1,36,34,"Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place."

1,36,39,"Baal Hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place. The name of his city was Pau. His wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab."
1,36,40,"These are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau, according to their families, after their places, and by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,"
1,36,41,"chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,"
1,36,42,"chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,"
1,36,43,"chief Magdiel, and chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of the Edomites."
1,37,1,"Jacob lived in the land of his father's travels, in the land of Canaan."
1,37,2,"This is the history of the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father."
1,37,3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a coat of many colors."
1,37,4,"His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn't speak peaceably to him."
1,37,5,"Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more."
1,37,6,"He said to them, Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:"
1,37,7,"for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf."
1,37,8,"His brothers said to him, Will you indeed reign over us? Or will you indeed have dominion over us? They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words."
1,37,9,"He dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me."
1,37,10,"He told it to his father and to his brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth?"
1,37,11,"His brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind."
1,37,12,"His brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem."
1,37,13,"Israel said to Joseph, Aren't your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them. He said to him, Here I am."
1,37,14,"He said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem."
1,37,15,"A certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, What are you looking for?"
1,37,16,"He said, I am looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock."
1,37,17,"The man said, They have left here, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan."
1,37,18,"They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him."
1,37,19,"They said one to another, Behold, this dreamer comes."
1,37,20,"Come now therefore, and let's kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, 'An evil animal has devoured him.' We will see what will become of his dreams."
1,37,21,"Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let's not take his life."
1,37,22,"Reuben said to them, Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him-that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father."
1,37,23,"It happened, when Joseph came to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;"
1,37,24,"and they took him, and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it."
1,37,25,"They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt."
1,37,26,"Judah said to his brothers, What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?"
1,37,27,"Come, and let's sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh. His brothers listened to him."
1,37,28,"Midianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. They brought Joseph into Egypt."
1,37,29,"Reuben returned to the pit; and saw that Joseph wasn't in the pit; and he tore his clothes."
1,37,30,"He returned to his brothers, and said, The child is no more; and I, where will I go?"
1,37,31,"They took Joseph's coat, and killed a male goat, and dipped the coat in the blood."
1,37,32,"They took the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, We have found this. Examine it, now, whether it is your son's coat or not."
1,37,33,"He recognized it, and said, It is my son's coat. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces."
1,37,34,"Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days."
1,37,35,"All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning. His father wept for him."
1,37,36,"The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard."
1,38,1,"It happened at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah."
1,38,2,"Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her, and went in to her."
1,38,3,"She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er."
1,38,4,"She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan."
1,38,5,"She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him."
1,38,6,"Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar."
1,38,7,"Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the"
1,38,8,"Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her, and raise up seed to your brother."
1,38,9,"Onan knew that the seed wouldn't be his; and it happened, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother."
1,38,10,"The thing which he did was evil in the sight of the"
1,38,11,"Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in your father's house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up; for he said, Lest he also die, like his brothers. Tamar went and lived in her father's house."
1,38,12,"After many days, Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite."
1,38,13,"It was told Tamar, saying, Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."
1,38,14,"She took off of her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn't given to him as a wife."
1,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face."
1,38,16,"He turned to her by the way, and said, Please come, let me come in to you, for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.She said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"
1,38,17,"He said, I will send you a kid of the goats from the flock.She said, Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?"
1,38,18,"He said, What pledge will I give you?She said, Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him."
1,38,19,"She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood."
1,38,20,"Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, but he did not find her."
1,38,21,"Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?They said, There has been no prostitute here."
1,38,22,"He returned to Judah, and said, I haven't found her; and also the men of the place said, 'There has been no prostitute here.'"
1,38,23,"Judah said, Let her keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this kid, and you haven't found her."
1,38,24,"It happened about three months later, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute; and moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution.Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."
1,38,25,"When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, I am with child. She also said, Please discern whose are these-the signet, and the cords, and the staff."
1,38,26,"Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shelah, my son.He knew her again no more."
1,38,27,"It happened in the time of her travail, that behold, twins were in her womb."
1,38,28,"When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, This came out first."
1,38,29,"It happened, as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out, and she said, Why have you made a breach for yourself? Therefore his name was called Perez."
1,38,30,"Afterward his brother came out, that had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah."
1,39,1,"Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there."
1,39,2,"The"
1,39,3,"His master saw that the"
1,39,4,"Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand."
1,39,5,"It happened from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the"
1,39,6,"He left all that he had in Joseph's hand. He did not concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate.Joseph was well-built and handsome."
1,39,7,"It happened after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, Lie with me."
1,39,8,"But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master doesn't know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand."
1,39,9,"He isn't greater in this house than I, neither has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
1,39,10,"As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he did not listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her."
1,39,11,"About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside."
1,39,12,"She caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me!He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside."
1,39,13,"When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside,"
1,39,14,"she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, Behold, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice."
1,39,15,"It happened, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside."
1,39,16,"She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home."
1,39,17,"She spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,"
1,39,18,"and it happened, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside."
1,39,19,"It happened, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, This is what your servant did to me, that his wrath was kindled."
1,39,20,"Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody."
1,39,21,"But the"
1,39,22,"The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it."
1,39,23,"The keeper of the prison did not look after anything that was under his hand, because the"
1,40,1,"It happened after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt."
1,40,2,"Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker."
1,40,3,"He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound."
1,40,4,"The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They stayed in prison many days."
1,40,5,"They both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison."
1,40,6,"Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad."
1,40,7,"He asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, saying, Why do you look so sad today?"
1,40,8,"They said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it.Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me."
1,40,9,"The chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me,"
1,40,10,"and in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes."
1,40,11,"Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
1,40,12,"Joseph said to him, This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days."
1,40,13,"Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his cupbearer."
1,40,14,"But remember me when it will be well with you, and show kindness, please, to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house."
1,40,15,"For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon."
1,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head."
1,40,17,"In the uppermost basket there was all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head."
1,40,18,"Joseph answered, This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days."
1,40,19,"Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you."
1,40,20,"It happened the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants."
1,40,21,"He restored the chief cupbearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand;"
1,40,22,"but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them."
1,40,23,"Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him."
1,41,1,"It happened at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the river."
1,41,2,"Behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh grass."
1,41,3,"Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river."
1,41,4,"The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke."
1,41,5,"He slept and dreamed a second time: and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good."
1,41,6,"Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them."
1,41,7,"The thin heads of grain blasted with the east wind swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream."
1,41,8,"It happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all of Egypt's magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh."
1,41,9,"Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, I remember my faults today."
1,41,10,"Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker."
1,41,11,"We dreamed a dream in one night, I and he. We dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream."
1,41,12,"There was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. To each man according to his dream he interpreted."
1,41,13,"It happened, as he interpreted to us, so it was: he restored me to my office, and he hanged him."
1,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh."
1,41,15,"Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."
1,41,16,"Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, Without God an answer of welfare shall not be given to Pharaoh."
1,41,17,"Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river:"
1,41,18,"and behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, fat and sleek. They fed in the marsh grass,"
1,41,19,"and behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness."
1,41,20,"The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle,"
1,41,21,"and when they had eaten them up, it couldn't be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke."
1,41,22,"I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good:"
1,41,23,"and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them."
1,41,24,"The seven thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me."
1,41,25,"Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh."
1,41,26,"The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. The dream is one."
1,41,27,"The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine."
1,41,28,"That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh. What God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh."
1,41,29,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt."
1,41,30,"There will arise after them seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,"
1,41,31,"and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous."
1,41,32,"The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
1,41,33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt."
1,41,34,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt's produce in the seven plenteous years."
1,41,35,"Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it."
1,41,36,"The food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; that the land not perish through the famine."
1,41,37,"The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants."
1,41,38,"Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?"
1,41,39,"Pharaoh said to Joseph, Because God has shown you all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as you."
1,41,40,"You shall be over my house, and according to your word will all my people be ruled. Only in the throne I will be greater than you."
1,41,41,"Pharaoh said to Joseph, Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."
1,41,42,"Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck,"
1,41,43,"and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had. They cried before him, Bow the knee! He set him over all the land of Egypt."
1,41,44,"Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt."
1,41,45,"Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-Paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt."
1,41,46,"Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt."
1,41,47,"In the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth abundantly."
1,41,48,"He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was around every city, he laid up in the same."
1,41,49,"Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for it was without number."
1,41,50,"To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him."
1,41,51,"Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, For, he said, God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."
1,41,52,"The name of the second, he called Ephraim: For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
1,41,53,"The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end."
1,41,54,"The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
1,41,55,"When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do."
1,41,56,"The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt."
1,41,57,"All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth."
1,42,1,"Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, Why do you look at one another?"
1,42,2,"He said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die."
1,42,3,"Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt."
1,42,4,"But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers; for he said, Lest perhaps harm happen to him."
1,42,5,"The sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan."
1,42,6,"Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph's brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth."
1,42,7,"Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, Where did you come from?They said, From the land of Canaan to buy food."
1,42,8,"Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him."
1,42,9,"Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said to them, You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land."
1,42,10,"They said to him, No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food."
1,42,11,"We are all one man's sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies."
1,42,12,"He said to them, No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land."
1,42,13,"They said, We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more."
1,42,14,"Joseph said to them, It is like I told you, saying, 'You are spies.'"
1,42,15,"By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go forth from here, unless your youngest brother comes here."
1,42,16,"Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies."
1,42,17,"He put them all together into custody for three days."
1,42,18,"Joseph said to them the third day, Do this, and live, for I fear God."
1,42,19,"If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses."
1,42,20,"Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won't die.They did so."
1,42,21,"They said one to another, We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn't listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us."
1,42,22,"Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not tell you, saying, 'Do not sin against the child,' and you wouldn't listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required."
1,42,23,"They did not know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them."
1,42,24,"He turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes."
1,42,25,"Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them."
1,42,26,"They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there."
1,42,27,"As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack."
1,42,28,"He said to his brothers, My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack! Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God has done to us?"
1,42,29,"They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying,"
1,42,30,"The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country."
1,42,31,"We said to him, 'We are honest men. We are no spies."
1,42,32,"We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.'"
1,42,33,"The man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way."
1,42,34,"Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.'"
1,42,35,"It happened as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid."
1,42,36,"Jacob, their father, said to them, You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me."
1,42,37,"Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Kill my two sons, if I do not bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again."
1,42,38,"He said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol."
1,43,1,"The famine was severe in the land."
1,43,2,"It happened, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little more food."
1,43,3,"Judah spoke to him, saying, The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.'"
1,43,4,"If you'll send our brother with us, we'll go down and buy you food,"
1,43,5,"but if you'll not send him, we'll not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.'"
1,43,6,"Israel said, Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?"
1,43,7,"They said, The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?' We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down?'"
1,43,8,"Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the boy with me, and we'll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones."
1,43,9,"I'll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I do not bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever,"
1,43,10,"for if we hadn't delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now."
1,43,11,"Their father, Israel, said to them, If it must be so, then do this. Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;"
1,43,12,"and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight."
1,43,13,"Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man."
1,43,14,"May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
1,43,15,"The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph."
1,43,16,"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and make ready; for the men will dine with me at noon."
1,43,17,"The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph's house."
1,43,18,"The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, we're brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys."
1,43,19,"They came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,"
1,43,20,"and said, Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food."
1,43,21,"When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand."
1,43,22,"We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks."
1,43,23,"He said, Peace be to you. Do not be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money. He brought Simeon out to them."
1,43,24,"The man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder."
1,43,25,"They made ready the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there."
1,43,26,"When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to him to the earth."
1,43,27,"He asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?"
1,43,28,"They said, Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive. They bowed the head, and did homage."
1,43,29,"He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? He said, God be gracious to you, my son."
1,43,30,"Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there."
1,43,31,"He washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, Serve the meal."
1,43,32,"They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians, that ate with him, by themselves, because the Egyptians do not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians."
1,43,33,"They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled one with another."
1,43,34,"He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him."
1,44,1,"He commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth."
1,44,2,"Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, with his grain money. He did according to the word that Joseph had spoken."
1,44,3,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys."
1,44,4,"When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Up, follow after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, 'Why have you rewarded evil for good?"
1,44,5,"Isn't this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.'"
1,44,6,"He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them."
1,44,7,"They said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!"
1,44,8,"Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord's house?"
1,44,9,"With whoever of your servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondservants."
1,44,10,"He said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found will be my bondservant; and you will be blameless."
1,44,11,"Then they hurried, and every man took his sack down to the ground, and every man opened his sack."
1,44,12,"He searched, beginning with the eldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin's sack."
1,44,13,"Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city."
1,44,14,"Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, and he was still there. They fell on the ground before him."
1,44,15,"Joseph said to them, What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can indeed divine?"
1,44,16,"Judah said, What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? Or how will we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are my lord's bondservants, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found."
1,44,17,"He said, Far be it from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my bondservant; but as for you, go up in peace to your father."
1,44,18,"Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and do not let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh."
1,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father, or a brother?'"
1,44,20,"We said to my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.'"
1,44,21,"You said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.'"
1,44,22,"We said to my lord, 'The boy can't leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.'"
1,44,23,"You said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face no more.'"
1,44,24,"It happened when we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord."
1,44,25,"Our father said, 'Go again, buy us a little food.'"
1,44,26,"We said, 'We can't go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the man's face, unless our youngest brother is with us.'"
1,44,27,"Your servant, my father, said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons:"
1,44,28,"and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I haven't seen him since."
1,44,29,"If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.'"
1,44,30,"Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the boy's life;"
1,44,31,"it will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more, that he will die. Your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to Sheol."
1,44,32,"For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him to you, then I will bear the blame to my father forever.'"
1,44,33,"Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy, a bondservant to my lord; and let the boy go up with his brothers."
1,44,34,"For how will I go up to my father, if the boy isn't with me?-lest I see the evil that will come on my father."
1,45,1,"Then Joseph couldn't control himself before all those who stood before him, and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me! No one else stood with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brothers."
1,45,2,"He wept aloud. The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard."
1,45,3,"Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph! Does my father still live?His brothers couldn't answer him; for they were terrified at his presence."
1,45,4,"Joseph said to his brothers, Come near to me, please.They came near. He said, I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt."
1,45,5,"Now do not be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life."
1,45,6,"For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest."
1,45,7,"God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance."
1,45,8,"So now it wasn't you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt."
1,45,9,"Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, 'This is what your son Joseph says, God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Do not wait."
1,45,10,"You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children's children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have."
1,45,11,"There I will nourish you; for there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have.'"
1,45,12,"Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you."
1,45,13,"You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. You shall hurry and bring my father down here."
1,45,14,"He fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck."
1,45,15,"He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them. After that his brothers talked with him."
1,45,16,"The report of it was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brothers have come. It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants."
1,45,17,"Pharaoh said to Joseph, Tell your brothers, 'Do this. Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of Canaan."
1,45,18,"Take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.'"
1,45,19,"Now you are commanded: do this. Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come."
1,45,20,"Also, do not concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all of the land of Egypt is yours."
1,45,21,"The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way."
1,45,22,"He gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing."
1,45,23,"To his father, he sent after this manner: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way."
1,45,24,"So he sent his brothers away, and they departed. He said to them, See that you do not quarrel on the way."
1,45,25,"They went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father."
1,45,26,"They told him, saying, Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. His heart fainted, for he did not believe them."
1,45,27,"They told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. When he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived."
1,45,28,"Israel said, It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."
1,46,1,"Israel traveled with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac."
1,46,2,"God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob!He said, Here I am."
1,46,3,"He said, I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation."
1,46,4,"I will go down with you into Egypt. I will also surely bring you up again. Joseph will close your eyes."
1,46,5,"Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him."
1,46,6,"They took their livestock, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt-Jacob, and all his seed with him,"
1,46,7,"his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and he brought all his seed with him into Egypt."
1,46,8,"These are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn."
1,46,9,"The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi."
1,46,10,"The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman."
1,46,11,"The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
1,46,12,"The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul."
1,46,13,"The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron."
1,46,14,"The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel."
1,46,15,"These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three."
1,46,16,"The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli."
1,46,17,"The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel."
1,46,18,"These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah, his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls."
1,46,19,"The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin."
1,46,20,"To Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him. And there were sons born to Manasseh, which the Aramean concubine bore to him: Machir. And Machir begot Gilead. And the sons of Ephraim, the brother of Manasseh: Shuthelah and Tahan. And the sons of Shuthelah: Eran"
1,46,21,"And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel. And the sons of Bela were: Gera and Naaman, and Ehi, and Rosh, and Muppim, and Huppim. And Gera begot Ard."
1,46,22,"These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were eighteen."
1,46,23,"The son of Dan: Hushim."
1,46,24,"The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem."
1,46,25,"These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob: all the souls were seven."
1,46,26,"All the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt, who were his direct descendants, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were sixty-six."
1,46,27,"The sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were nine souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy-five."
1,46,28,"He sent Judah before him to Joseph, to show the way before him to Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen."
1,46,29,"Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen. He presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while."
1,46,30,"Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive."
1,46,31,"Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father's house, I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell him, 'My brothers, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me."
1,46,32,"These men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.'"
1,46,33,"It will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will say, 'What is your occupation?'"
1,46,34,"that you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers:' that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians."
1,47,1,"Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers, with their flocks, their herds, and all that they own, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen."
1,47,2,"From among his brothers he took five men, and presented them to Pharaoh."
1,47,3,"Pharaoh said to his brothers, What is your occupation?They said to Pharaoh, Your servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers."
1,47,4,"They said to Pharaoh, We have come to live as foreigners in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
1,47,5,"Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Your father and your brothers have come to you."
1,47,6,"The land of Egypt is before you. Make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen. If you know any able men among them, then put them in charge of my livestock."
1,47,7,"Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
1,47,8,"Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of your life?"
1,47,9,"Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage."
1,47,10,"Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh."
1,47,11,"Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
1,47,12,"Joseph nourished his father, his brothers, and all of his father's household, with bread, according to their families."
1,47,13,"There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine."
1,47,14,"Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house."
1,47,15,"When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For our money fails."
1,47,16,"Joseph said, Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock, if your money is gone."
1,47,17,"They brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year."
1,47,18,"When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands."
1,47,19,"Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won't be desolate."
1,47,20,"So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh's."
1,47,21,"As for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it."
1,47,22,"Only he did not buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land."
1,47,23,"Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land."
1,47,24,"It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."
1,47,25,"They said, You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
1,47,26,"Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's."
1,47,27,"Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly."
1,47,28,"Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years."
1,47,29,"The time drew near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please do not bury me in Egypt,"
1,47,30,"but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place.He said, I will do as you have said."
1,47,31,"He said, Swear to me, and he swore to him. Israel bowed himself on the bed's head."
1,48,1,"It happened after these things, that someone said to Joseph, Behold, your father is sick. He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
1,48,2,"Someone told Jacob, and said, Behold, your son Joseph comes to you, and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed."
1,48,3,"Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,"
1,48,4,"and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.'"
1,48,5,"Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine."
1,48,6,"Your issue, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance."
1,48,7,"As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem)."
1,48,8,"Israel saw Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?"
1,48,9,"Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me here.He said, Please bring them to me, and I will bless them."
1,48,10,"Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn't see. He brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them."
1,48,11,"Israel said to Joseph, I did not think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your seed also."
1,48,12,"Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth."
1,48,13,"Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him."
1,48,14,"Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn."
1,48,15,"He blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,"
1,48,16,"the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. Let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
1,48,17,"When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head."
1,48,18,"Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head."
1,48,19,"His father refused, and said, I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a multitude of nations."
1,48,20,"He blessed them that day, saying, In you will Israel bless, saying, 'God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh' He set Ephraim before Manasseh."
1,48,21,"Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers."
1,48,22,"Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."
1,49,1,"Jacob called to his sons, and said: Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come."
1,49,2,"Assemble yourselves, and hear, you sons of Jacob.Listen to Israel, your father."
1,49,3,"Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength;excelling in dignity, and excelling in power."
1,49,4,"Boiling over as water, you shall not excel;because you went up to your father's bed,then defiled it. He went up to my couch."
1,49,5,"Simeon and Levi are brothers.Their swords are weapons of violence."
1,49,6,"My soul, do not come into their council.My glory, do not be united to their assembly;for in their anger they killed men.In their self-will they hamstrung cattle."
1,49,7,"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;and their wrath, for it was cruel.I will divide them in Jacob,and scatter them in Israel."
1,49,8,"Judah, your brothers will praise you.Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies.Your father's sons will bow down before you."
1,49,9,"Judah is a lion's cub.From the prey, my son, you have gone up.He stooped down, he crouched as a lion,as a lioness.Who will rouse him up?"
1,49,10,"The scepter will not depart from Judah,nor the ruler's staff from between his feet,until he comes to whom it belongs.To him will the obedience of the peoples be."
1,49,11,"Binding his foal to the vine,his donkey's colt to the choice vine;he has washed his garments in wine,his robes in the blood of grapes."
1,49,12,"His eyes will be red with wine,his teeth white with milk."
1,49,13,"Zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea.He will be for a haven of ships.His border will be on Sidon."
1,49,14,"Issachar is a strong donkey,lying down between the saddlebags."
1,49,15,"He saw a resting place, that it was good,the land, that it was pleasant.He bows his shoulder to the burden,and becomes a servant doing forced labor."
1,49,16,"Dan will judge his people,as one of the tribes of Israel."
1,49,17,"Dan will be a serpent in the way,an adder in the path,That bites the horse's heels,so that his rider falls backward."

1,49,22,"Joseph is a fruitful vine,a fruitful vine by a spring.His branches run over the wall."
1,49,23,"The archers have sorely grieved him,shot at him, and persecute him:"
1,49,24,"But his bow remained strong.The arms of his hands were made strong,by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob,(from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),"
1,49,25,"even by the God of your father, who will help you;by the Almighty, who will bless you,with blessings of heaven above,blessings of the deep that lies below,blessings of the breasts, and of the womb."
1,49,26,"The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of your ancestors,above the boundaries of the ancient hills.They will be on the head of Joseph,on the crown of the head of him who is separated from his brothers."
1,49,27,"Benjamin is a ravenous wolf.In the morning he will devour the prey.At evening he will divide the spoil."
1,49,28,"All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them and blessed them. He blessed everyone according to his blessing."
1,49,29,"He instructed them, and said to them, I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,"
1,49,30,"in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place."
1,49,31,"There they buried Abraham and Sarah, his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah, his wife, and there I buried Leah:"
1,49,32,"the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth."
1,49,33,"When Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the spirit, and was gathered to his people."
1,50,1,"Joseph fell on his father's face, wept on him, and kissed him."
1,50,2,"Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel."
1,50,3,"Forty days were fulfilled for him, for that is how many the days it takes to embalm. The Egyptians wept for him for seventy days."
1,50,4,"When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,"
1,50,5,"'My father made me swear, saying, Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.'"
1,50,6,"Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury your father, just like he made you swear."
1,50,7,"Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
1,50,8,"all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen."
1,50,9,"There went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company."
1,50,10,"They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days."
1,50,11,"When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians. Therefore, its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan."
1,50,12,"His sons did to him just as he commanded them,"
1,50,13,"for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre."
1,50,14,"Joseph returned into Egypt-he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father."
1,50,15,"When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which we did to him."
1,50,16,"They sent a message to Joseph, saying, Your father commanded before he died, saying,"
1,50,17,"'You shall tell Joseph, Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you.' Now, please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your father. Joseph wept when they spoke to him."
1,50,18,"His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we are your servants."
1,50,19,"Joseph said to them, Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God?"
1,50,20,"As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive."
1,50,21,"Now therefore do not be afraid. I will nourish you and your little ones. He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them."
1,50,22,"Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father's house. Joseph lived one hundred ten years."
1,50,23,"Joseph saw Ephraim's children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph's knees."
1,50,24,"Joseph said to his brothers, I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
1,50,25,"Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here."
1,50,26,"So Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."
2,1,1,"Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):"
2,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,"
2,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,"
2,1,4,"Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher."
2,1,5,"All the souls who came out of Jacob's body were seventy-five souls, and Joseph was in Egypt already."
2,1,6,"Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation."
2,1,7,"The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them."
2,1,8,"Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph."
2,1,9,"He said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we."
2,1,10,"Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and escape out of the land."
2,1,11,"Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses."
2,1,12,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They were grieved because of the children of Israel."
2,1,13,"The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve,"
2,1,14,"and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve."
2,1,15,"The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah,"
2,1,16,"and he said, When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool; if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live."
2,1,17,"But the midwives feared God, and did not do what the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive."
2,1,18,"The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have you done this thing, and have saved the boys alive?"
2,1,19,"The midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women aren't like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and give birth before the midwife comes to them."
2,1,20,"God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty."
2,1,21,"It happened, because the midwives feared God, that he gave them families."
2,1,22,"Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive."
2,2,1,"A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife."
2,2,2,"The woman conceived, and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months."
2,2,3,"When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river's bank."
2,2,4,"His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him."
2,2,5,"Pharaoh's daughter came down to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket among the reeds, and sent her handmaid to get it."
2,2,6,"She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children."
2,2,7,"Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?"
2,2,8,"Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go.The maiden went and called the child's mother."
2,2,9,"Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.The woman took the child, and nursed it."
2,2,10,"The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water."
2,2,11,"It happened in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brothers, and looked at their burdens. He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers."
2,2,12,"He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand."
2,2,13,"He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. He said to him who did the wrong, Why do you strike your fellow?"
2,2,14,"He said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday? Moses was afraid, and said, Surely this thing is known."
2,2,15,"Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well."
2,2,16,"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock."
2,2,17,"The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock."
2,2,18,"When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, How is it that you have returned so early today?"
2,2,19,"They said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock."
2,2,20,"He said to his daughters, Where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."
2,2,21,"Moses was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter."
2,2,22,"She bore a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land."
2,2,23,"It happened in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage."
2,2,24,"God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob."
2,2,25,"God saw the children of Israel, and God was concerned about them."
2,3,1,"Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to God's mountain, to Horeb."
2,3,2,"The angel of the"
2,3,3,"Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."
2,3,4,"When the"
2,3,5,"He said, Do not come close. Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place you are standing on is holy ground."
2,3,6,"Moreover he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God."
2,3,7,"The"
2,3,8,"I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite."
2,3,9,"Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them."
2,3,10,"Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt."
2,3,11,"Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?"
2,3,12,"He said, Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."
2,3,13,"Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you;' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' What should I tell them?"
2,3,14,"God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM, and he said, You shall tell the children of Israel this: 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
2,3,15,"God said moreover to Moses, You shall tell the children of Israel this, 'The"
2,3,16,"Go, and gather the elders of the children of Israel together, and tell them, 'The"
2,3,17,"and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.'"
2,3,18,"They will listen to your voice, and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall tell him, 'The"
2,3,19,"I know that the king of Egypt won't give you permission to go, except by a mighty hand."
2,3,20,"I will put forth my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst, and after that he will let you go."
2,3,21,"I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and it will happen that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed."
2,3,22,"But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters. You shall despoil the Egyptians."
2,4,1,"Moses answered, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice; for they will say, 'The"
2,4,2,"The"
2,4,3,"He said, Throw it on the ground.He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses ran away from it."
2,4,4,"The"
2,4,5,"That they may believe that the"
2,4,6,"The"
2,4,7,"He said, Put your hand inside your cloak again.He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out of his cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh."
2,4,8,"It will happen, if they will neither believe you nor listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign."
2,4,9,"It will happen, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither listen to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land."
2,4,10,"Moses said to the"
2,4,11,"The"
2,4,12,"Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak."
2,4,13,"He said, Oh, Lord, please send someone else."
2,4,14,"The anger of the"
2,4,15,"You shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do."
2,4,16,"He will be your spokesman to the people; and it will happen, that he will be to you a mouth, and you will be to him as God."
2,4,17,"You shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs."
2,4,18,"Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive.Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace."
2,4,19,"The"
2,4,20,"Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took God's rod in his hand."
2,4,21,"The"
2,4,22,"You shall tell Pharaoh, 'Thus says the"
2,4,23,"and I have said to you, Let my son go, that he may serve me; and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.'"
2,4,24,"It happened on the way at a lodging place, that the"
2,4,25,"Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me."
2,4,26,"So he let him alone. Then she said, You are a bridegroom of blood, because of the circumcision."
2,4,27,"The"
2,4,28,"Moses told Aaron all the words of the"
2,4,29,"Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel."
2,4,30,"Aaron spoke all the words which the"
2,4,31,"The people believed, and when they heard that the"
2,5,1,"Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, This is what the"
2,5,2,"Pharaoh said, Who is the"
2,5,3,"They said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the"
2,5,4,"The king of Egypt said to them, Why do you, Moses and Aaron, separate the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!"
2,5,5,"Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens."
2,5,6,"The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,"
2,5,7,"You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves."
2,5,8,"The number of the bricks, which they made before, you require from them. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'"
2,5,9,"Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may regard it; and do not let them regard lying words."
2,5,10,"The taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, This is what Pharaoh says: I will not give you straw."
2,5,11,"Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished."
2,5,12,"So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw."
2,5,13,"The taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw given to you!"
2,5,14,"The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Why haven't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?"
2,5,15,"Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why do you deal this way with your servants?"
2,5,16,"No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, 'Make brick!' and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people."
2,5,17,"But he said, You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the"
2,5,18,"Go therefore now, and work, for no straw shall be given to you, yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!"
2,5,19,"The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble, when it was said, You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!"
2,5,20,"They met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:"
2,5,21,"and they said to them, May the"
2,5,22,"Moses returned to the"
2,5,23,"For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people; neither have you delivered your people at all."
2,6,1,"The"
2,6,2,"God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am the"
2,6,3,"and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name the"
2,6,4,"I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived as foreigners."
2,6,5,"Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant."
2,6,6,"Therefore tell the children of Israel, 'I am the"
2,6,7,"and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and you shall know that I am the"
2,6,8,"I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the"
2,6,9,"Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage."
2,6,10,"The"
2,6,11,"Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land."
2,6,12,"Moses spoke before the"
2,6,13,"The"
2,6,14,"These are the heads of their fathers' houses. The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben."
2,6,15,"The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon."
2,6,16,"These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were one hundred thirty-seven years."
2,6,17,"The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families."
2,6,18,"The sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred thirty-three years."
2,6,19,"The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations."
2,6,20,"Amram took Jochebed his father's sister to himself as wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty-seven years."
2,6,21,"The sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri."
2,6,22,"The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri."
2,6,23,"Aaron took Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, as his wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
2,6,24,"The sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites."
2,6,25,"Eleazar Aaron's son took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites according to their families."
2,6,26,"These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the"
2,6,27,"These are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. These are that Moses and Aaron."
2,6,28,"It happened on the day when the"
2,6,29,"that the"
2,6,30,"Moses said before the"
2,7,1,"The"
2,7,2,"You shall speak all that I command you; and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land."
2,7,3,"I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt."
2,7,4,"But Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I will lay my hand on Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments."
2,7,5,"The Egyptians shall know that I am the"
2,7,6,"Moses and Aaron did so. As the"
2,7,7,"Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh."
2,7,8,"The"
2,7,9,"When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Perform a miracle!' then you shall tell Aaron, 'Take your rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.'"
2,7,10,"Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, as the"
2,7,11,"Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers. They also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments."
2,7,12,"For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods."
2,7,13,"Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them; as the"
2,7,14,"The"
2,7,15,"Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Behold, he goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river's bank to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand."
2,7,16,"You shall tell him, 'The"
2,7,17,"Thus says the"
2,7,18,"The fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river.'"
2,7,19,"The"
2,7,20,"Moses and Aaron did so, as the"
2,7,21,"The fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians couldn't drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt."
2,7,22,"The magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them; as the"
2,7,23,"Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart."
2,7,24,"All the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink; for they couldn't drink of the water of the river."
2,7,25,"Seven days were fulfilled, after the"
2,8,1,"The"
2,8,2,"If you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your borders with frogs:"
2,8,3,"and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedchamber, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:"
2,8,4,"and the frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.'"
2,8,5,"The"
2,8,6,"Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt."
2,8,7,"The magicians did in like manner with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt."
2,8,8,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the"
2,8,9,"Moses said to Pharaoh, I give you the honor of setting the time that I should pray for you, and for your servants, and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, and remain in the river only."
2,8,10,"He said, Tomorrow.He said, Be it according to your word, that you may know that there is none like the"
2,8,11,"The frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only."
2,8,12,"Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the"
2,8,13,"The"
2,8,14,"They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank."
2,8,15,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and did not listen to them, as the"
2,8,16,"The"
2,8,17,"They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice on man, and on animal; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt."
2,8,18,"The magicians tried with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they couldn't. There were lice on man, and on animal."
2,8,19,"Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them; as the"
2,8,20,"The"
2,8,21,"Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are."
2,8,22,"I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am the"
2,8,23,"I will put a division between my people and your people: by tomorrow shall this sign be.'"
2,8,24,"The"
2,8,25,"Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go, sacrifice to your God in the land!"
2,8,26,"Moses said, It isn't appropriate to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the"
2,8,27,"We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the"
2,8,28,"Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the"
2,8,29,"Moses said, Behold, I go out from you, and I will pray to the"
2,8,30,"Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to the"
2,8,31,"The"
2,8,32,"Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go."
2,9,1,"Then the"
2,9,2,"For if you refuse to let them go, and hold them still,"
2,9,3,"behold, the hand of the"
2,9,4,"The"
2,9,5,"The"
2,9,6,"The"
2,9,7,"Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the livestock of Israel dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go."
2,9,8,"The"
2,9,9,"It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with boils on man and on animal, throughout all the land of Egypt."
2,9,10,"They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky; and it became a boil breaking forth with boils on man and on animal."
2,9,11,"The magicians couldn't stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians."
2,9,12,"The"
2,9,13,"The"
2,9,14,"For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart, against your officials, and against your people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth."
2,9,15,"For now I would have put forth my hand, and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth;"
2,9,16,"but indeed for this cause I have made you stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth;"
2,9,17,"as you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won't let them go."
2,9,18,"Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now."
2,9,19,"Now therefore command that all of your livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter. Every man and animal that is found in the field, and isn't brought home, the hail shall come down on them, and they shall die.'"
2,9,20,"Those who feared the word of the"
2,9,21,"Whoever did not regard the word of the"
2,9,22,"The"
2,9,23,"Moses stretched forth his rod toward the heavens, and the"
2,9,24,"So there was very severe hail, and lightning mixed with the hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation."
2,9,25,"The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and animal; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field."
2,9,26,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail."
2,9,27,"Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time. The"
2,9,28,"Pray to the"
2,9,29,"Moses said to him, As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the"
2,9,30,"But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the"
2,9,31,"The flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom."
2,9,32,"But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they had not grown up."
2,9,33,"Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the"
2,9,34,"When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants."
2,9,35,"The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go, just as the"
2,10,1,"The"
2,10,2,"and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your son's son, what things I have done to Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know that I am the"
2,10,3,"Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, This is what the"
2,10,4,"Or else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country,"
2,10,5,"and they shall cover the surface of the earth, so that one won't be able to see the earth. They shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field."
2,10,6,"Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.' He turned, and went out from Pharaoh."
2,10,7,"Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the"
2,10,8,"Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, Go, serve the"
2,10,9,"Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to the"

2,10,11,"Not so! Go now you who are men, and serve the"
2,10,12,"The"
2,10,13,"Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the"
2,10,14,"The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. They were very grievous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such."
2,10,15,"For they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that the land was destroyed,and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt."
2,10,16,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, I have sinned against the"
2,10,17,"Now therefore please forgive my sin again, and pray to the"
2,10,18,"He went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to the"
2,10,19,"The"
2,10,20,"But the"
2,10,21,"The"
2,10,22,"Moses stretched forth his hand toward the sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days."
2,10,23,"They did not see one another, neither did anyone rise from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings."
2,10,24,"Pharaoh called to Moses and said, Go, serve the"
2,10,25,"Moses said, You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the"
2,10,26,"Our livestock also shall go with us. There shall not a hoof be left behind, for of it we must take to serve the"
2,10,27,"But the"
2,10,28,"Pharaoh said to him, Get away from me! Be careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!"
2,10,29,"Moses said, You have spoken well. I will see your face again no more."
2,11,1,"The"
2,11,2,"Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold."
2,11,3,"The"
2,11,4,"Moses said, This is what the"
2,11,5,"and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of livestock."
2,11,6,"There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor shall be any more."
2,11,7,"But against any of the children of Israel a dog won't even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal; that you may know that the"
2,11,8,"All these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Get out, with all the people who follow you; and after that I will go out.' He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger."
2,11,9,"The"
2,11,10,"Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and the"
2,12,1,"The"
2,12,2,"This month shall be to you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year to you."
2,12,3,"Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth day of this month, they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household;"
2,12,4,"and if the household is too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls; according to what everyone can eat you shall make your count for the lamb."
2,12,5,"Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old. You shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:"
2,12,6,"and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening."
2,12,7,"They shall take some of the blood, and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel, on the houses in which they shall eat it."
2,12,8,"They shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and unleavened bread. They shall eat it with bitter herbs."
2,12,9,"Do not eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; with its head, its legs and its inner parts."
2,12,10,"You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire."
2,12,11,"This is how you shall eat it: with your waist girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is the"
2,12,12,"For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and animal. Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the"
2,12,13,"The blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be on you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt."
2,12,14,"This day shall be to you for a memorial, and you shall keep it a feast to the"
2,12,15,"'Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel."
2,12,16,"In the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you."
2,12,17,"You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever."
2,12,18,"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty first day of the month at evening."
2,12,19,"Seven days shall there be no yeast found in your houses, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a foreigner, or one who is born in the land."
2,12,20,"You shall eat nothing leavened. In all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.'"
2,12,21,"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out, and take lambs according to your families, and kill the Passover."
2,12,22,"You shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning."
2,12,23,"For the"

2,12,31,"He called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve the"

2,12,33,"The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, We are all dead men."
2,12,34,"The people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders."
2,12,35,"The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing."
2,12,36,"The"

2,12,38,"A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much livestock."
2,12,39,"They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it wasn't leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn't wait, neither had they prepared for themselves any food."
2,12,40,"Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years."
2,12,41,"It happened at the end of four hundred thirty years, even the same day it happened, that all the armies of the"

2,12,47,"All the congregation of Israel shall keep it."
2,12,48,"When a stranger shall live as a foreigner with you, and will keep the Passover to the"

2,13,18,"but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt."
2,13,19,"Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the children of Israel swear, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you."

2,14,4,"I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will follow after them; and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies; and the Egyptians shall know that I am the"
2,14,5,"It was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"
2,14,6,"He made ready his chariot, and took his army with him;"
2,14,7,"and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them."
2,14,8,"The"
2,14,9,"The Egyptians pursued after them: all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army; and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal Zephon."
2,14,10,"When Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were very afraid. The children of Israel cried out to the"
2,14,11,"They said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us forth out of Egypt?"
2,14,12,"Isn't this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?' For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness."

2,14,20,"It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one did not come near the other all the night."
2,14,21,"Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the"
2,14,22,"The children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left."

2,16,15,"When the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is it? For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, It is the bread which the"
2,16,16,"This is the thing which the"
2,16,17,"The children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less."
2,16,18,"When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They gathered every man according to his eating."
2,16,19,"Moses said to them, Let no one leave of it until the morning."
2,16,20,"Notwithstanding they did not listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was angry with them."
2,16,21,"They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted."
2,16,22,"It happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one, and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses."
2,16,23,"He said to them, This is that which the"
2,16,24,"They laid it up until the morning, as Moses asked, and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm in it."
2,16,25,"Moses said, Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to the"
2,16,26,"Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none."
2,16,27,"It happened on the seventh day, that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none."
2,16,28,"The"
2,16,29,"Behold, because the"
2,16,30,"So the people rested on the seventh day."
2,16,31,"The house of Israel called its name Manna, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey."
2,16,32,"Moses said, This is the thing which the"
2,16,33,"Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before the"
2,16,34,"As the"
2,16,35,"The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan."
2,16,36,"Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah."
2,17,1,"All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to the"
2,17,2,"Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, Give us water to drink.Moses said to them, Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the"
2,17,3,"The people were thirsty for water there; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?"
2,17,4,"Moses cried to the"
2,17,5,"The"
2,17,6,"Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink. Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel."
2,17,7,"He called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because the children of Israel quarreled, and because they tested the"
2,17,8,"Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim."
2,17,9,"Moses said to Joshua, Choose men for us, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God's rod in my hand."
2,17,10,"So Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill."
2,17,11,"It happened, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed."
2,17,12,"But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset."
2,17,13,"Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword."
2,17,14,"The"
2,17,15,"Moses built an altar, and called its name the"
2,17,16,"He said, Yah has sworn: 'The"
2,18,1,"Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that the"
2,18,2,"Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away,"
2,18,3,"and her two sons. The name of one son was Gershom, for Moses said, I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land."
2,18,4,"The name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, My father's God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh's sword."
2,18,5,"Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the Mountain of God."
2,18,6,"He said to Moses, Behold, Jethro, your father-in-law, has come to you, with your wife and her two sons with her."
2,18,7,"Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him. They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent."
2,18,8,"Moses told his father-in-law all that the"
2,18,9,"Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the"
2,18,10,"Jethro said, Blessed be the"
2,18,11,"Now I know that the"
2,18,12,"Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God."
2,18,13,"It happened on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening."
2,18,14,"When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?"
2,18,15,"Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God."
2,18,16,"When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws."
2,18,17,"Moses' father-in-law said to him, The thing that you do is not good."
2,18,18,"You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone."
2,18,19,"Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before God, and bring the causes to God."
2,18,20,"You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do."
2,18,21,"Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
2,18,22,"Let them judge the people at all times. It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you."
2,18,23,"If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all of these people also will go to their place in peace."
2,18,24,"So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said."
2,18,25,"Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
2,18,26,"They judged the people at all times. They brought the hard causes to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves."
2,18,27,"Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land."
2,19,1,"In the third month after the children of Israel had gone forth out of the land of Egypt, on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai."
2,19,2,"When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain."
2,19,3,"Moses went up to God, and the"
2,19,4,"'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself."
2,19,5,"Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice, and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine;"
2,19,6,"and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.' These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel."
2,19,7,"Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the"
2,19,8,"All the people answered together, and said, All that the"

2,19,12,"You shall set bounds to the people all around, saying, 'Be careful that you do not go up onto the mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death."
2,19,13,"No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.' When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain."
2,19,14,"Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes."
2,19,15,"He said to the people, Be ready by the third day. Do not have sexual relations with a woman."
2,19,16,"It happened on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled."
2,19,17,"Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain."
2,19,18,"Mount Sinai, all it, smoked, because the"
2,19,19,"When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice."
2,19,20,"The"
2,19,21,"The"
2,19,22,"Let the priests also, who come near to the"
2,19,23,"Moses said to the"
2,19,24,"The"
2,19,25,"So Moses went down to the people, and told them."
2,20,1,"God spoke all these words, saying,"
2,20,2,"I am the"
2,20,3,"You shall have no other gods before me."
2,20,4,"You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:"
2,20,5,"you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, the"

2,20,7,"You shall not take the name of the"
2,20,8,"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."
2,20,9,"You shall labor six days, and do all your work,"
2,20,10,"but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the"
2,20,11,"for in six days the"
2,20,12,"Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which the"
2,20,13,"You shall not murder."
2,20,14,"You shall not commit adultery."
2,20,15,"You shall not steal."
2,20,16,"You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor."
2,20,17,"You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's."
2,20,18,"All the people perceived the thunderings, the lightnings, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled, and stayed at a distance."
2,20,19,"They said to Moses, Speak with us yourself, and we will listen; but do not let God speak with us, lest we die."
2,20,20,"Moses said to the people, Do not be afraid, for God has come to test you, and that his fear may be before you, that you won't sin."
2,20,21,"The people stayed at a distance, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was."
2,20,22,"The"
2,20,23,"You shall most certainly not make alongside of me gods of silver, or gods of gold for yourselves."
2,20,24,"You shall make an altar of earth for me, and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you."
2,20,25,"If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of cut stones; for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it."
2,20,26,"Neither shall you go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed to it.'"
2,21,1,"Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them."
2,21,2,"If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years and in the seventh he shall go out free without paying anything."
2,21,3,"If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself. If he is married, then his wife shall go out with him."
2,21,4,"If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself."
2,21,5,"But if the servant shall plainly say, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children. I will not go out free;'"
2,21,6,"then his master shall bring him to God, and shall bring him to the door or to the doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him for ever."
2,21,7,"If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she shall not go out as the male servants do."
2,21,8,"If she doesn't please her master, who has married her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her."
2,21,9,"If he marries her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters."
2,21,10,"If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, and her marital rights."
2,21,11,"If he doesn't do these three things for her, she may go free without paying any money."
2,21,12,"One who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death,"
2,21,13,"but not if it is unintentional, but God allows it to happen: then I will appoint you a place where he shall flee."
2,21,14,"If a man schemes and comes presumptuously on his neighbor to kill him, you shall take him from my altar, that he may die."
2,21,15,"Anyone who attacks his father or his mother shall be surely put to death."
2,21,16,"Anyone who kidnaps someone and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death."
2,21,17,"Anyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death."
2,21,18,"If men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he doesn't die, but is confined to bed;"
2,21,19,"if he rises again and walks around with his staff, then he who struck him shall be cleared: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall provide for his healing until he is thoroughly healed."
2,21,20,"If a man strikes his servant or his maid with a rod, and he dies under his hand, he shall surely be punished."
2,21,21,"Notwithstanding, if he gets up after a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his property."
2,21,22,"If men fight and hurt a pregnant woman so that she gives birth prematurely, and yet no harm follows, he shall be surely fined as much as the woman's husband demands and the judges allow."
2,21,23,"But if any harm follows, then you must take life for life,"
2,21,24,"eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,"
2,21,25,"burning for burning, wound for wound, and bruise for bruise."
2,21,26,"If a man strikes his servant's eye, or his maid's eye, and destroys it, he shall let him go free for his eye's sake."
2,21,27,"If he strikes out his male servant's tooth, or his female servant's tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake."
2,21,28,"If a bull gores a man or a woman to death, the bull shall surely be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the bull shall not be held responsible."
2,21,29,"But if the bull had a habit of goring in the past, and it has been testified to its owner, and he has not kept it in, but it has killed a man or a woman, the bull shall be stoned, and its owner shall also be put to death."
2,21,30,"If a ransom is laid on him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is laid on him."
2,21,31,"Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter, according to this judgment it shall be done to him."
2,21,32,"If the bull gores a male servant or a female servant, thirty shekels of silver shall be given to their master, and the ox shall be stoned."
2,21,33,"If a man opens a pit, or if a man digs a pit and doesn't cover it, and a bull or a donkey falls into it,"
2,21,34,"the owner of the pit shall make it good. He shall give money to its owner, and the dead animal shall be his."
2,21,35,"If one man's bull injures another's, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live bull, and divide its price; and they shall also divide the dead animal."
2,21,36,"Or if it is known that the bull was in the habit of goring in the past, and its owner has not kept it in, he shall surely pay bull for bull, and the dead animal shall be his own."
2,22,1,"If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it, or sells it; he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep."
2,22,2,"If the thief is found breaking in, and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no guilt of bloodshed for him."
2,22,3,"If the sun has risen on him, there shall be guilt of bloodshed for him; he shall make restitution. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft."
2,22,4,"If the stolen property is found in his hand alive, whether it is ox, donkey, or sheep, he shall pay double."
2,22,5,"If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and lets his animal loose, and it grazes in another man's field, [he shall make restitution from his own field according to his produce; and if he shall have grazed over the whole field,] he shall make restitution from the best of his own field, and from the best of his own vineyard."
2,22,6,"If fire breaks out, and catches in thorns so that the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed; he who kindled the fire shall surely make restitution."
2,22,7,"If a man delivers to his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it is stolen out of the man's house; if the thief is found, he shall pay double."
2,22,8,"If the thief isn't found, then the master of the house shall come near to God, to find out if he hasn't put his hand to his neighbor's goods."
2,22,9,"For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for clothing, or for any kind of lost thing, about which one says, 'This is mine,' the cause of both parties shall come before God. He whom God condemns shall pay double to his neighbor."
2,22,10,"If a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep, and it dies or is injured, or driven away, no man seeing it;"
2,22,11,"the oath of the"
2,22,12,"But if it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution to its owner."
2,22,13,"If it is torn in pieces, let him bring it for evidence. He shall not make good that which was torn."
2,22,14,"If a man borrows anything of his neighbor's, and it is injured, or dies, its owner not being with it, he shall surely make restitution."
2,22,15,"If its owner is with it, he shall not make it good. If it is a leased thing, it came for its lease."
2,22,16,"If a man entices a virgin who isn't pledged to be married, and lies with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife."
2,22,17,"If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins."
2,22,18,"You shall not allow a sorceress to live."
2,22,19,"Whoever has sex with an animal shall surely be put to death."
2,22,20,"He who sacrifices to any god, except to the"
2,22,21,"You shall not wrong a foreigner, neither shall you oppress him, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt."
2,22,22,"You shall not take advantage of any widow or fatherless child."
2,22,23,"If you take advantage of them at all, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry;"
2,22,24,"and my wrath will grow hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless."
2,22,25,"If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor, you shall not be to him as a creditor; neither shall you charge him interest."
2,22,26,"If you take your neighbor's garment as collateral, you shall restore it to him before the sun goes down,"
2,22,27,"for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin. What would he sleep in? It will happen, when he cries to me, that I will hear, for I am gracious."
2,22,28,"You shall not blaspheme God, nor curse a ruler of your people."
2,22,29,"You shall not delay to offer from your harvest and from the outflow of your presses.You shall give the firstborn of your sons to me."
2,22,30,"You shall do likewise with your cattle and with your sheep. Seven days it shall be with its mother, then on the eighth day you shall give it to me."
2,22,31,"You shall be holy men to me, therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals in the field. You shall cast it to the dogs."
2,23,1,"You shall not spread a false report. Do not join your hand with the wicked to be an unjust witness."
2,23,2,"You shall not follow a crowd to do evil; neither shall you testify in court to side with a multitude to pervert justice;"
2,23,3,"neither shall you favor a poor man in his cause."
2,23,4,"If you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey going astray, you shall surely bring it back to him again."
2,23,5,"If you see the donkey of him who hates you fallen down under his burden, do not leave him, you shall surely help him with it."
2,23,6,"You shall not deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits."
2,23,7,"Keep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent and righteous: for I will not justify the wicked."
2,23,8,"You shall take no bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of those who have sight and perverts the words of the righteous."
2,23,9,"You shall not oppress a foreigner, for you know the heart of a foreigner, seeing you were foreigners in the land of Egypt."
2,23,10,"For six years you shall sow your land, and shall gather in its increase,"
2,23,11,"but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave the animal of the field shall eat. In like manner you shall deal with your vineyard and with your olive grove."
2,23,12,"Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest, that your ox and your donkey may have rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the alien may be refreshed."
2,23,13,"Be careful to do all things that I have said to you; and do not invoke the name of other gods, neither let them be heard out of your mouth."
2,23,14,"You shall observe a feast to me three times a year."
2,23,15,"You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it you came out from Egypt), and no one shall appear before me empty."
2,23,16,"And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you sow in the field: and the feast of harvest, at the end of the year, when you gather in your labors out of the field."
2,23,17,"Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord"
2,23,18,"You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread, neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning."
2,23,19,"The first of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring into the house of the"

2,23,21,"Pay attention to him, and listen to his voice. Do not provoke him, for he will not pardon your disobedience, for my name is in him."
2,23,22,"But if you indeed listen to his voice, and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies, and an adversary to your adversaries."
2,23,23,"For my angel shall go before you, and bring you in to the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I will cut them off."
2,23,24,"You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor follow their practices, but you shall utterly overthrow them and demolish their pillars."
2,23,25,"You shall serve the"

2,23,27,"I will send my terror before you, and will confuse all the people to whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you."
2,23,28,"I will send the hornet before you, which will drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before you."
2,23,29,"I will not drive them out from before you in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the animals of the field multiply against you."
2,23,30,"Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you have increased and inherit the land."
2,23,31,"I will set your border from the Red Sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you."
2,23,32,"You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods."
2,23,33,"They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against me, for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you."
2,24,1,"He said to Moses, Come up to the"

2,24,10,"They saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was like a paved work of sapphire stone, like the skies for clearness."
2,24,11,"He did not lay his hand on the nobles of the children of Israel. They saw God, and ate and drank."

2,32,2,"Aaron said to them, Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me."
2,32,3,"All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron."
2,32,4,"He received what they handed him, and fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said, These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt."

2,32,14,"The"
2,32,15,"Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other they were written."
2,32,16,"The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tables."
2,32,17,"When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is the noise of war in the camp."
2,32,18,"He said, It isn't the voice of those who shout for victory, neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear."
2,32,19,"It happened, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses' anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain."

2,32,22,"Aaron said, Do not let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil."
2,32,23,"For they said to me, 'Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'"
2,32,24,"I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let them take it off:' so they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."

2,33,4,"When the people heard this evil news, they mourned: and no one put on his jewelry."
2,33,5,"The"
2,33,6,"The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward."

2,33,14,"He said, My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
2,33,15,"He said to him, If your presence doesn't go with me, do not carry us up from here."
2,33,16,"For how would people know that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Isn't it in that you go with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people who are on the surface of the earth?"
2,33,17,"The"
2,33,18,"He said, Please show me your glory."

2,36,7,"For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much."
2,36,8,"All the wise-hearted men among those who did the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, blue, purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skillful workman, they made them."
2,36,9,"The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains had one measure."
2,36,10,"He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled one to another."

2,36,12,"He made fifty loops in the one curtain, and he made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling. The loops were opposite one to another."
2,36,13,"He made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was a unit."
2,36,14,"He made curtains of goats' hair for a covering over the tabernacle. He made them eleven curtains."

2,36,18,"He made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be a unit."
2,36,19,"He made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of sea cow hides above."
2,36,20,"He made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing up."
2,36,21,"Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board."
2,36,22,"Each board had two tenons, joined one to another. He made all the boards of the tabernacle this way."
2,36,23,"He made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side southward."
2,36,24,"He made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons."
2,36,25,"For the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards,"
2,36,26,"and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board."

2,36,29,"They were double beneath, and in like manner they were all the way to its top to one ring. He did thus to both of them in the two corners."
2,36,30,"There were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; under every board two sockets."
2,36,31,"He made bars of acacia wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,"
2,36,32,"and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward."
2,36,33,"He made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other."
2,36,34,"He overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold."
2,36,35,"He made the veil of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim. He made it the work of a skillful workman."

2,37,3,"He cast four rings of gold for it, in its four feet; even two rings on its one side, and two rings on its other side."
2,37,4,"He made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold."
2,37,5,"He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark."
2,37,6,"He made a mercy seat of pure gold. Its length was two and a half cubits, and a cubit and a half its breadth."
2,37,7,"He made two cherubim of gold. He made them of beaten work, at the two ends of the mercy seat;"
2,37,8,"one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end. He made the cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at its two ends."
2,37,9,"The cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces toward one another. The faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat."
2,37,10,"He made the table of acacia wood. Its length was two cubits, and its breadth was a cubit, and its height was a cubit and a half."
2,37,11,"He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it."
2,37,12,"He made a border of a handbreadth around it, and made a golden molding on its border around it."
2,37,13,"He cast four rings of gold for it, and put the rings in the four corners that were on its four feet."
2,37,14,"The rings were close by the border, the places for the poles to carry the table."

4,21,5,"The people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loathes this light bread."
4,21,6,"The"
4,21,7,"The people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against the"

4,21,10,"The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in Oboth."
4,21,11,"They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise."
4,21,12,"From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered."
4,21,13,"From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites."
4,21,14,"Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of the"
4,21,15,"the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab."
4,21,16,"From there they traveled to Beer: that is the well of which the"
4,21,17,"Then sang Israel this song:Spring up, well; sing to it:"
4,21,18,"the well, which the princes dug,which the nobles of the people dug,with the scepter, and with their poles.From the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah;"
4,21,19,"and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;"
4,21,20,"and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert."
4,21,21,"Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,"
4,21,22,"Let me pass through your land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed your border."
4,21,23,"Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel."
4,21,24,"Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong."
4,21,25,"Israel took all these cities: and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its towns."
4,21,26,"For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon."
4,21,27,"Therefore those who speak in proverbs say,Come to Heshbon.Let the city of Sihon be built and established;"
4,21,28,"for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,a flame from the city of Sihon.It has devoured Ar of Moab,The lords of the high places of the Arnon."
4,21,29,"Woe to you, Moab!You are undone, people of Chemosh!He has given his sons as fugitives,and his daughters into captivity,to Sihon king of the Amorites."
4,21,30,"We have shot at them.Heshbon has perished even to Dibon.We have laid waste even to Nophah,Which reaches to Medeba."
4,21,31,"Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites."
4,21,32,"Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its towns, and drove out the Amorites who were there."
4,21,33,"They turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei."
4,21,34,"The"
4,21,35,"So they struck him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land."
4,22,1,"The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho."
4,22,2,"Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites."
4,22,3,"Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel."
4,22,4,"Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time."
4,22,5,"He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people who came out from Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me."
4,22,6,"Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed."
4,22,7,"The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak."
4,22,8,"He said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the"
4,22,9,"God came to Balaam, and said, Who are these men with you?"
4,22,10,"Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has said to me,"
4,22,11,"'Behold, the people that has come out of Egypt, it covers the surface of the earth: now, come curse me them; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.'"
4,22,12,"God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people; for they are blessed."
4,22,13,"Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Go to your land; for the"
4,22,14,"The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us."
4,22,15,"Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they."
4,22,16,"They came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, 'Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me:"
4,22,17,"for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.'"
4,22,18,"Balaam answered the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of the"
4,22,19,"Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may know what the"
4,22,20,"God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do."
4,22,21,"Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab."
4,22,22,"God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of the"
4,22,23,"The donkey saw the angel of the"
4,22,24,"Then the angel of the"
4,22,25,"The donkey saw the angel of the"
4,22,26,"The angel of the"
4,22,27,"The donkey saw the angel of the"
4,22,28,"The"
4,22,29,"Balaam said to the donkey, Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you."
4,22,30,"The donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?He said, No."
4,22,31,"Then the"
4,22,32,"The angel of the"
4,22,33,"and the donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. Unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive."
4,22,34,"Balaam said to the angel of the"
4,22,35,"The angel of the"
4,22,36,"When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border."
4,22,37,"Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?"
4,22,38,"Balaam said to Balak, Behold, I have come to you: have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak."
4,22,39,"Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth."
4,22,40,"Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him."
4,22,41,"It happened in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there the utmost part of the people."
4,23,1,"Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams."
4,23,2,"Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram."
4,23,3,"Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go: perhaps the"
4,23,4,"God met Balaam: and he said to him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar."
4,23,5,"The"
4,23,6,"He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab."
4,23,7,"He took up his parable, and said,From Aram has Balak brought me,the king of Moab from the mountains of the East.Come, curse Jacob for me.Come, defy Israel."
4,23,8,"How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?How shall I defy whom the"
4,23,9,"For from the top of the rocks I see him.From the hills I see him.Behold, it is a people that dwells alone,and shall not be reckoned among the nations."
4,23,10,"Who can count the dust of Jacob,or number the fourth part of Israel?Let me die the death of the righteous!Let my last end be like his!"
4,23,11,"Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether."
4,23,12,"He answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the"
4,23,13,"Balak said to him, Please come with me to another place, where you may see them; you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there."
4,23,14,"He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar."
4,23,15,"He said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet over there."
4,23,16,"The"
4,23,17,"He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. Balak said to him, What has the"
4,23,18,"He took up his parable, and said,Rise up, Balak, and hear!Listen to me, you son of Zippor."
4,23,19,"God is not a man, that he should lie,nor the son of man, that he should repent.Has he said, and will he not do it?Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?"
4,23,20,"Behold, I have received a command to bless.He has blessed, and I can't reverse it."
4,23,21,"He has not seen iniquity in Jacob.Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel.The"
4,23,22,"God brings them out of Egypt.He has as it were the strength of the wild ox."
4,23,23,"Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob;Neither is there any divination with Israel.Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel,What has God done!"
4,23,24,"Behold, the people rises up as a lioness,As a lion he lifts himself up.He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey,and drinks the blood of the slain."
4,23,25,"Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all."
4,23,26,"But Balaam answered Balak, Did I not tell you, saying, 'All that the"
4,23,27,"Balak said to Balaam, Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse me them from there."
4,23,28,"Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert."
4,23,29,"Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams."
4,23,30,"Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar."
4,24,1,"When Balaam saw that it pleased the"
4,24,2,"Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him."
4,24,3,"He took up his parable, and said,Balaam the son of Beor says,the man whose eye was closed says;"
4,24,4,"he says, who hears the words of God,who sees the vision of the Almighty,falling down, and having his eyes open:"
4,24,5,"How goodly are your tents, Jacob,and your tents, Israel!"
4,24,6,"As valleys they are spread forth,as gardens by the riverside,as aloes which the"
4,24,7,"Water shall flow from his buckets.His seed shall be in many waters.His king shall be higher than Agag.His kingdom shall be exalted."
4,24,8,"God brings him out of Egypt.He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.He shall eat up the nations his adversaries,shall break their bones in pieces,and pierce them with his arrows."
4,24,9,"He couched, he lay down as a lion,as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?Everyone who blesses you is blessed.Everyone who curses you is cursed."
4,24,10,"Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times."
4,24,11,"Therefore now flee you to your place! I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, the"
4,24,12,"Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also tell your messengers who you sent to me, saying,"
4,24,13,"'If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of the"
4,24,14,"Now, behold, I go to my people: come, I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days."
4,24,15,"He took up his parable, and said,Balaam the son of Beor says,the man whose eye was closed says;"
4,24,16,"he says, who hears the words of God,knows the knowledge of the Most High,and who sees the vision of the Almighty,Falling down, and having his eyes open:"
4,24,17,"I see him, but not now.I see him, but not near.A star will come out of Jacob.A scepter will rise out of Israel,and shall strike through the corners of Moab,and break down all the sons of Sheth."
4,24,18,"Edom shall be a possession.Seir, his enemies, also shall be a possession,while Israel does valiantly."
4,24,19,"Out of Jacob shall one have dominion,and shall destroy the remnant from the city."
4,24,20,"He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said,Amalek was the first of the nations,But his latter end shall come to destruction."
4,24,21,"He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said,Your dwelling place is strong.Your nest is set in the rock."
4,24,22,"Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted,until Asshur carries you away captive."
4,24,23,"He took up his parable, and said,Alas, who shall live when God does this?"
4,24,24,"But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim.They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber.He also shall come to destruction."
4,24,25,"Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way."
4,25,1,"Israel stayed in Shittim; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab:"
4,25,2,"for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods; and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods."
4,25,3,"Israel joined himself to Baal Peor: and the anger of the"
4,25,4,"The"
4,25,5,"Moses said to the judges of Israel, Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor."
4,25,6,"Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting."
4,25,7,"When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand;"
4,25,8,"and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel."
4,25,9,"Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand."
4,25,10,"The"
4,25,11,"Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I did not consume the children of Israel in my jealousy."
4,25,12,"Therefore say, 'Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace:"
4,25,13,"and it shall be to him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.'"
4,25,14,"Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers' house among the Simeonites."
4,25,15,"The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers' house in Midian."
4,25,16,"The"
4,25,17,"Harass the Midianites, and strike them;"
4,25,18,"for they harassed you with their wiles, with which they have deceived you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor."
4,26,1,"It happened after the plague, that the"
4,26,2,"Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' houses, all who are able to go forth to war in Israel."

5,3,5,"All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many."
5,3,6,"We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones."
5,3,7,"But all the livestock, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves."
5,3,8,"We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon."
5,3,9,"(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.)"
5,3,10,"We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
5,3,11,"(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; isn't it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, after the cubit of a man.)"
5,3,12,"This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and its cities, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites:"
5,3,13,"and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim."

5,3,15,"I gave Gilead to Machir."
5,3,16,"To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;"
5,3,17,"the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward."
5,3,18,"I commanded you at that time, saying, The"

5,14,7,"Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of those who have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the hare, and the rabbit; because they chew the cud but do not part the hoof, they are unclean to you."
5,14,8,"The pig, because it has a split hoof but doesn't chew the cud, is unclean to you: of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch."
5,14,9,"These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales may you eat;"

5,22,20,"But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young lady;"
5,22,21,"then they shall bring out the young lady to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done folly in Israel, to play the prostitute in her father's house: so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you."
5,22,22,"If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man who lay with the woman, and the woman: so you shall put away the evil from Israel."
5,22,23,"If there is a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;"
5,22,24,"then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones; the lady, because she did not cry, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor's wife: so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you."
5,22,25,"But if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her; then the man only who lay with her shall die:"
5,22,26,"but to the lady you shall do nothing; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death: for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and kills him, even so is this matter;"
5,22,27,"for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married lady cried, and there was none to save her."
5,22,28,"If a man find a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;"

5,31,17,"Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, 'Haven't these evils come on us because our God is not among us?'"
5,31,18,"I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have worked, in that they are turned to other gods."
5,31,19,"Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel."
5,31,20,"For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant."
5,31,21,"It shall happen, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I swore."
5,31,22,"So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel."
5,31,23,"He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you."
5,31,24,"It happened, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,"
5,31,25,"that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the"
5,31,26,"Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the"
5,31,27,"For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against the"
5,31,28,"Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them."
5,31,29,"For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you will do that which is evil in the sight of the"
5,31,30,"Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished."
5,32,1,"Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak.Let the earth hear the words of my mouth."
5,32,2,"My doctrine shall drop as the rain.My speech shall condense as the dew,as the small rain on the tender grass,as the showers on the herb."
5,32,3,"For I will proclaim the name of the"
5,32,4,"The Rock, his work is perfect,for all his ways are justice:a God of faithfulness and without iniquity,just and right is he."
5,32,5,"They have dealt corruptly with him. They are not his children, because of their defect.They are a perverse and crooked generation."
5,32,6,"Do you thus requite the"

5,32,11,"As an eagle that stirs up her nest,that flutters over her young,he spread abroad his wings, he took them,he bore them on his feathers."
5,32,12,"The"
5,32,13,"He made him ride on the high places of the earth.He ate the increase of the field.He caused him to suck honey out of the rock,oil out of the flinty rock;"
5,32,14,"Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock,with fat of lambs,rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,with the finest of the wheat.Of the blood of the grape you drank wine."
5,32,15,"But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked.You have grown fat.You have grown thick.You have become sleek.Then he forsook God who made him,and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation."
5,32,16,"They moved him to jealousy with strange gods.They provoked him to anger with abominations."
5,32,17,"They sacrificed to demons, not God,to gods that they did not know,to new gods that came up recently,which your fathers did not dread."
5,32,18,"Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful,and have forgotten God who gave you birth."
5,32,19,"The"
5,32,20,"He said, I will hide my face from them.I will see what their end shall be;for they are a very perverse generation,children in whom is no faithfulness."
5,32,21,"They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God.They have provoked me to anger with their vanities.I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people.I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation."
5,32,22,"For a fire is kindled in my anger,Burns to the lowest Sheol,Devours the earth with its increase,and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire."
5,32,23,"I will heap evils on them.I will spend my arrows on them."
5,32,24,"They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heatand bitter destruction.I will send the teeth of animals on them,With the poison of crawling things of the dust."
5,32,25,"Outside the sword shall bereave,and in the rooms, terror;on both young man and virgin,The nursing infant with the gray-haired man."
5,32,26,"I said, I would scatter them afar.I would make their memory to cease from among men;"
5,32,27,"were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,lest their adversaries should judge wrongly,lest they should say, 'Our hand is exalted,the"
5,32,28,"For they are a nation void of counsel.There is no understanding in them."
5,32,29,"Oh that they were wise, that they understood this,that they would consider their latter end!"
5,32,30,"How could one chase a thousand,and two put ten thousand to flight,unless their Rock had sold them,and the"
5,32,31,"For their rock is not as our Rock,even our enemies themselves being judges."
5,32,32,"For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,of the fields of Gomorrah.Their grapes are grapes of gall,Their clusters are bitter."
5,32,33,"Their wine is the poison of serpents,The cruel venom of asps."
5,32,34,"Isn't this laid up in store with me,sealed up among my treasures?"
5,32,35,"Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,at the time when their foot slides;for the day of their calamity is at hand.The things that are to come on them shall make haste."
5,32,36,"For the"
5,32,37,"He will say, Where are their gods,The rock in which they took refuge;"
5,32,38,"Which ate the fat of their sacrifices,And drank the wine of their drink offering?Let them rise up and help you!Let them be your protection."
5,32,39,"See now that I, even I, am he,There is no god with me.I kill, and I make alive.I wound, and I heal.There is no one who can deliver out of my hand."
5,32,40,"For I lift up my hand to heaven,And say, As I live forever,"
5,32,41,"if I whet my glittering sword,My hand take hold on judgment;I will render vengeance to my adversaries,and will recompense those who hate me."
5,32,42,"I will make my arrows drunk with blood.My sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives,from the head of the leaders of the enemy."
5,32,43,"Rejoice, O heavens, with him, and let all the angels of God worship him.Rejoice, O nations, with his people, and let all the angels of God strengthen themselves in him. For he will avenge the blood of his sons, and render vengeance to his enemies, and will recompense them that hate him, and will cleanse the land for his people."
5,32,44,"Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun."
5,32,45,"Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;"
5,32,46,"He said to them, Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you this day, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law."
5,32,47,"For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it."

5,32,50,"and die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:"
5,32,51,"because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you did not sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel."
5,32,52,"For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel."
5,33,1,"This is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death."
5,33,2,"He said,The"
5,33,3,"Yes, he loves the people.All his saints are in your hand.They sat down at your feet;each receives your words."
5,33,4,"Moses commanded us a law,An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob."
5,33,5,"He was king in Jeshurun,When the heads of the people were gathered,All the tribes of Israel together."
5,33,6,"Let Reuben live, and not die;Nor let his men be few."
5,33,7,"This is for Judah. He said,Hear,"
5,33,8,"Of Levi he said,Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one,whom you proved at Massah,with whom you strove at the waters of Meribah;"
5,33,9,"who said of his father, and of his mother, 'I have not seen him;'Neither did he acknowledge his brothers,Nor did he know his own children:For they have observed your word,and keep your covenant."
5,33,10,"They shall teach Jacob your ordinances,and Israel your law.They shall put incense before you,and whole burnt offering on your altar."
5,33,11,"The"
5,33,12,"Of Benjamin he said,The beloved of the"
5,33,13,"Of Joseph he said,His land is blessed by the"

5,33,15,"for the chief things of the ancient mountains,for the precious things of the everlasting hills,"
5,33,16,"for the precious things of the earth and its fullness,the good will of him who lived in the bush.Let this come on the head of Joseph,on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers."
5,33,17,"The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his.His horns are the horns of the wild ox.With them he shall push all of the peoples, to the ends of the earth:They are the ten thousands of Ephraim.They are the thousands of Manasseh."
5,33,18,"Of Zebulun he said,Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;and Issachar, in your tents."
5,33,19,"They shall call the peoples to the mountain.There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness,for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas,the hidden treasures of the sand."
5,33,20,"Of Gad he said,He who enlarges Gad is blessed.He dwells as a lioness,and tears the arm, yes, the crown of the head."
5,33,21,"He provided the first part for himself,for there was the lawgiver's portion reserved.He came with the heads of the people.He executed the righteousness of the"
5,33,22,"Of Dan he said,Dan is a lion's cubthat leaps out of Bashan."
5,33,23,"Of Naphtali he said,Naphtali, satisfied with favor,full of the blessing of the"

5,33,25,"Your bars shall be iron and brass.As your days, so your strength will be."
5,33,26,"There is none like God, Jeshurun,who rides on the heavens for your help,In his majesty through the skies."
5,33,27,"The eternal God is your dwelling place.Underneath are the everlasting arms.He thrust out the enemy from before you,and said, 'Destroy!'"
5,33,28,"Israel dwells in safety;the fountain of Jacob alone,In a land of grain and new wine.Yes, his heavens drop down dew."
5,33,29,"You are happy, Israel.Who is like you, a people saved by the"
5,34,1,"Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. The"
5,34,2,"and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the hinder sea,"
5,34,3,"and the Negev, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, to Zoar."

5,34,8,"The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended."
5,34,9,"Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him: and the children of Israel listened to him, and did as the"

6,1,1,"Now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of the"
6,1,2,"Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you, and all this people, to the land which I give to them, even to the children of Israel."
6,1,3,"I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will tread on, as I told Moses."
6,1,4,"From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border."
6,1,5,"No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you."
6,1,6,"Be strong and of good courage; for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them."
6,1,7,"Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go."
6,1,8,"This scroll of the Law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success."

6,1,15,"until the"
6,1,16,"They answered Joshua, saying, All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go."
6,1,17,"Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you. Only may the"

6,2,1,"Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim as spies, saying, Go, view the land, and Jericho. They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and slept there."
6,2,2,"The king of Jericho was told, Behold, men of the children of Israel came in here tonight to spy out the land."
6,2,3,"The king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered into your house; for they have come to spy out all the land."
6,2,4,"The woman took the two men and hid them. Then she said, Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they came from."
6,2,5,"It happened about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the men went, I do not know. Pursue them quickly; for you will overtake them."
6,2,6,"But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof."
6,2,7,"The men pursued them the way to the Jordan to the fords: and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate."
6,2,8,"Before they had lain down, she came up to them on the roof;"
6,2,9,"and she said to the men, I know that the"
6,2,10,"For we have heard how the"
6,2,11,"As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for the"

6,2,14,"The men said to her, Our life for yours, if you do not talk about this business of ours; and it shall be, when the"
6,2,15,"Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived on the wall."
6,2,16,"She said to them, Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward, you may go your way."
6,2,17,"The men said to her, We will be guiltless of this your oath which you have made us to swear."
6,2,18,"Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by. You shall gather to yourself into the house your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father's household."
6,2,19,"It shall be that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless. Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand is on him."
6,2,20,"But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear."
6,2,21,"She said, According to your words, so be it. She sent them away, and they departed. She tied the scarlet line in the window."
6,2,22,"They went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but did not find them."
6,2,23,"Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain, passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had happened to them."
6,2,24,"They said to Joshua, Truly the"
6,3,1,"Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they moved from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel. They lodged there before they passed over."
6,3,2,"It happened after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp;"
6,3,3,"and they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of the"
6,3,4,"Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near to it, that you may know the way by which you must go; for you have not passed this way before."
6,3,5,"Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow the"
6,3,6,"Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. They took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people."
6,3,7,"The"
6,3,8,"You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, 'When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"
6,3,9,"Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of the"
6,3,10,"Joshua said, Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite out from before you."
6,3,11,"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan."
6,3,12,"Now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man."
6,3,13,"It shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the"
6,3,14,"It happened, when the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant being before the people,"
6,3,15,"and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest),"
6,3,16,"that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people passed over right against Jericho."
6,3,17,"The priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the"
6,4,1,"It happened, when all the nation had completely passed over the Jordan, that the"
6,4,2,"Take twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,"
6,4,3,"and command them, saying, 'Take from out of the middle of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging place, where you will lodge tonight.'"
6,4,4,"Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man."
6,4,5,"Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of the"
6,4,6,"that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask in time to come, saying, 'What do you mean by these stones?'"
6,4,7,"then you shall tell them, 'Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the"
6,4,8,"The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as the"
6,4,9,"Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day."
6,4,10,"For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan, until everything was finished that the"
6,4,11,"It happened, when all the people had completely passed over, that the ark of the"
6,4,12,"The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them."
6,4,13,"About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war passed over before the"

6,4,17,"Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come up out of the Jordan!"
6,4,18,"It happened, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the"
6,4,19,"The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho."
6,4,20,"Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, in Gilgal."
6,4,21,"He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, 'What do these stones mean?'"
6,4,22,"Then you shall let your children know, saying, 'Israel came over this Jordan on dry land."
6,4,23,"For the"
6,4,24,"that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the"
6,5,1,"It happened, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how that the"
6,5,2,"At that time, the"
6,5,3,"Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the Hill of the Foreskins."
6,5,4,"This is the reason Joshua circumcised: all the people who came out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt."
6,5,5,"For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised."
6,5,6,"For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not listen to the voice of the"
6,5,7,"Their children, whom he raised up in their place, were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way."
6,5,8,"It happened, when they were done circumcising all the nation, that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed."
6,5,9,"The"
6,5,10,"The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal. They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho."
6,5,11,"They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day."
6,5,12,"The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Israel did not have manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year."
6,5,13,"It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"
6,5,14,"He said, No; but I have come now as captain of the"
6,5,15,"The captain of the"
6,6,1,"Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel. No one went out, and no one came in."
6,6,2,"The"
6,6,3,"All your men of war shall march around the city, going around the city once. You shall do this six days."
6,6,4,"Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark. On the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets."
6,6,5,"It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him."
6,6,6,"Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the"
6,6,7,"They said to the people, Advance! March around the city, and let the armed men pass on before the"
6,6,8,"It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the"
6,6,9,"The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the ark went after them. The trumpets sounded as they went."
6,6,10,"Joshua commanded the people, saying, You shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout."
6,6,11,"So he caused the ark of the"
6,6,12,"Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the"
6,6,13,"The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the"
6,6,14,"The second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. They did this six days."
6,6,15,"It happened on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times. Only on this day they marched around the city seven times."
6,6,16,"It happened at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout, for the"
6,6,17,"The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to the"
6,6,18,"But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so would you make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it."
6,6,19,"But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy to the"
6,6,20,"So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets. It happened, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city."
6,6,21,"They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword."
6,6,22,"Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the prostitute's house, and bring out from there the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her."
6,6,23,"The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. They also brought out all her relatives, and they set them outside of the camp of Israel."
6,6,24,"They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of the"
6,6,25,"But Rahab the prostitute, her father's household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive. She lived in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."
6,6,26,"Joshua commanded them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the"
6,6,27,"So the"
6,7,1,"But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. Therefore the"
6,7,2,"Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the land.The men went up and spied out Ai."
6,7,3,"They returned to Joshua, and said to him, Do not let all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Do not make all the people to toil there, for there are only a few of them."
6,7,4,"So about three thousand men of the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai."
6,7,5,"The men of Ai struck about thirty-six men of them, and they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck them at the descent. The hearts of the people melted, and became like water."
6,7,6,"Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the"
6,7,7,"Joshua said, Alas, Lord"
6,7,8,"Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!"
6,7,9,"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. What will you do for your great name?"
6,7,10,"The"
6,7,11,"Israel has sinned. Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even taken of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and also deceived. They have even put it among their own stuff."
6,7,12,"Therefore the children of Israel can't stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will not be with you any more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you."
6,7,13,"Get up! Sanctify the people, and say, 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for the"
6,7,14,"In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. It shall be that the tribe which the"
6,7,15,"It shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the"
6,7,16,"So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes. The tribe of Judah was selected."
6,7,17,"He brought near the family of Judah; and he selected the family of the Zerahites. He brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was selected."
6,7,18,"He brought near his household man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected."
6,7,19,"Joshua said to Achan, My son, please give glory to the"
6,7,20,"Achan answered Joshua, and said, I have truly sinned against the"
6,7,21,"When I saw among the spoil a beautiful Babylonian robe, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them and took them. Behold, they are hidden in the ground in the middle of my tent, with the silver under it."
6,7,22,"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. Behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it."
6,7,23,"They took them from the middle of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel. They laid them down before the"
6,7,24,"Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor."
6,7,25,"Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? The"
6,7,26,"They raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. The"
6,8,1,"The"
6,8,2,"You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king, except its spoil and its livestock, you shall take for a plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it."
6,8,3,"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them out by night."
6,8,4,"He commanded them, saying, Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready."
6,8,5,"I, and all the people who are with me, will approach to the city. It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them."
6,8,6,"They will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, 'They flee before us, like the first time.' So we will flee before them,"
6,8,7,"and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city; for the"
6,8,8,"It shall be, when you have seized on the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do this according to the word of the"
6,8,9,"Joshua sent them out; and they went to set up the ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua stayed among the people that night."
6,8,10,"Joshua rose up early in the morning, mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai."
6,8,11,"All the people, even the men of war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai."
6,8,12,"He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city."
6,8,13,"So they set the people, even all the army who was on the north of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley."
6,8,14,"It happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city."
6,8,15,"Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness."
6,8,16,"All the people who were in the city were called together to pursue after them. They pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city."
6,8,17,"There was not a man left in Ai or Beth El who did not go out after Israel. They left the city open, and pursued Israel."
6,8,18,"The"
6,8,19,"The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it. They hurried and set the city on fire."
6,8,20,"When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way. The people who fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers."
6,8,21,"When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and killed the men of Ai."
6,8,22,"The others came out of the city against them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. They struck them, so that they let none of them remain or escape."
6,8,23,"They captured the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua."
6,8,24,"It happened, when Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai, and struck it with the edge of the sword."
6,8,25,"All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai."
6,8,26,"For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai."
6,8,27,"Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves, according to the word of the"
6,8,28,"So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to this day."
6,8,29,"He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until the evening, and at the sundown Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised a great heap of stones on it that remains to this day."
6,8,30,"Then Joshua built an altar to the"
6,8,31,"as Moses the servant of the"
6,8,32,"He wrote there on the stones a copy of the Law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel."
6,8,33,"All Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, who carried the ark of the"
6,8,34,"Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the scroll of the Law."
6,8,35,"There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who were among them."
6,9,1,"It happened, when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard of it"
6,9,2,"that they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord."
6,9,3,"But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,"
6,9,4,"they also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys, and wineskins, old and torn and bound up,"
6,9,5,"and old and patched shoes on their feet, and wore old garments. All the bread of their provision was dry and moldy."
6,9,6,"They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, We have come from a far country. Now therefore make a covenant with us."
6,9,7,"The men of Israel said to the Hivites, What if you live among us. How could we make a covenant with you?"
6,9,8,"They said to Joshua, We are your servants.Joshua said to them, Who are you? Where do you come from?"
6,9,9,"They said to him, Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of the"
6,9,10,"and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth."
6,9,11,"Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, 'Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and tell them, We are your servants. Now make a covenant with us.'"
6,9,12,"This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and has become moldy."
6,9,13,"These wineskins, which we filled, were new; and behold, they are torn. These our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey."
6,9,14,"The men sampled their provisions, and did not ask counsel from the mouth of the"
6,9,15,"Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live. The princes of the congregation swore to them."
6,9,16,"It happened at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they lived among them."
6,9,17,"The children of Israel traveled and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim."
6,9,18,"The children of Israel did not strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by the"
6,9,19,"But all the princes said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by the"
6,9,20,"This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to them."
6,9,21,"The princes said to them, Let them live, so they became wood cutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them."
6,9,22,"Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have you deceived us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' when you live among us?"
6,9,23,"Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you will never fail to be bondservants, both wood cutters and drawers of water for the house of my God."
6,9,24,"They answered Joshua, and said, Because your servants were certainly told how the"
6,9,25,"Now, behold, we are in your hand. Do to us as it seems good and right to you to do."
6,9,26,"He did so to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they did not kill them."
6,9,27,"That day Joshua made them wood cutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the"
6,10,1,"Now it happened when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;"
6,10,2,"that they were very afraid, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty."
6,10,3,"Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,"
6,10,4,"Come up to me, and help me, and let us strike Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel."
6,10,5,"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it."
6,10,6,"The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Do not abandon your servants! Come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country have gathered together against us."
6,10,7,"So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor."
6,10,8,"The"
6,10,9,"Joshua therefore came on them suddenly. He went up from Gilgal all night."
6,10,10,"The"
6,10,11,"It happened, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth Horon, that the"
6,10,12,"Then Joshua spoke to the"
6,10,13,"The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Isn't this written in the book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the midst of the sky, and did not hurry to go down about a whole day."
6,10,14,"There was no day like that before it or after it, that the"
6,10,15,"Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal."
6,10,16,"These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah."
6,10,17,"Joshua was told, saying, The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah."
6,10,18,"Joshua said, Roll large stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them;"
6,10,19,"but do not stay. Pursue your enemies, and attack them from the rear. Do not allow them to enter into their cities; for the"
6,10,20,"It happened, when Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,"
6,10,21,"that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel."
6,10,22,"Then Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out of the cave to me."
6,10,23,"They did so, and brought those five kings out of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon."
6,10,24,"It happened, when they brought those kings out to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him, Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.They came near, and put their feet on their necks."
6,10,25,"Joshua said to them, Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed. Be strong and of good courage, for the"
6,10,26,"Afterward Joshua struck them, put them to death, and hanged them on five trees. They were hanging on the trees until the evening."
6,10,27,"It happened at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day."
6,10,28,"Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king. He utterly destroyed them and all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining. He did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho."
6,10,29,"Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah."
6,10,30,"The"
6,10,31,"Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it."
6,10,32,"The"
6,10,33,"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he had left him none remaining."
6,10,34,"Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it fought against it."
6,10,35,"They took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish."
6,10,36,"Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it."
6,10,37,"They took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king and all its cities, and all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls who were in it."
6,10,38,"Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it."
6,10,39,"He took it, with its king and all its cities. They struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining. As he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king."
6,10,40,"So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, and the Negev, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings. He left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the"
6,10,41,"Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon."
6,10,42,"Joshua took all these kings and their land at one time, because the"
6,10,43,"Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal."
6,11,1,"It happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph,"
6,11,2,"and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country, in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,"
6,11,3,"to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah."
6,11,4,"They went out, they and all their armies with them, many people, even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots."
6,11,5,"All these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel."
6,11,6,"The"
6,11,7,"So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell on them."
6,11,8,"The"
6,11,9,"Joshua did to them as the"
6,11,10,"Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword: for Hazor used to be the head of all those kingdoms."
6,11,11,"They struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was no one left who breathed. He burnt Hazor with fire."
6,11,12,"Joshua captured all the cities of those kings, with their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of the"
6,11,13,"But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only. Joshua burned that."
6,11,14,"The children of Israel took all the spoil of these cities, with the livestock, as spoils for themselves; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They did not leave any who breathed."
6,11,15,"As the"
6,11,16,"So Joshua captured all that land, the hill country, all the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;"
6,11,17,"from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon. He took all their kings, struck them, and put them to death."
6,11,18,"Joshua made war a long time with all those kings."
6,11,19,"There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took all in battle."
6,11,20,"For it was of the"
6,11,21,"Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities."
6,11,22,"There were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain."
6,11,23,"So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the"
6,12,1,"Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel struck, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward:"

6,12,4,"and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,"
6,12,5,"and ruled in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon."

6,13,1,"Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years. The"

6,13,7,"Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh."
6,13,8,"With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the"

6,13,12,"all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for Moses attacked these, and drove them out."
6,13,13,"Nevertheless the children of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day."
6,13,14,"Only he gave no inheritance to the tribe of Levi. The offerings of the"
6,13,15,"Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families."
6,13,16,"Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;"

6,13,22,"The children of Israel also killed Balaam, the son of Beor, the soothsayer, with the sword, among the rest of their slain."
6,13,23,"The border of the children of Reuben was the bank of the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and its villages."

6,13,28,"This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and its villages."
6,13,29,"Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh. It was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families."

6,13,31,"Half Gilead, Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir according to their families."
6,13,32,"These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward."
6,13,33,"But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance. The"
6,14,1,"These are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed to them,"
6,14,2,"by the lot of their inheritance, as the"
6,14,3,"For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them."
6,14,4,"For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their livestock and for their property."
6,14,5,"The children of Israel did as the"

6,14,12,"Now therefore give me this hill country, of which the"
6,14,13,"Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance."
6,14,14,"Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day; because he wholly followed the"
6,14,15,"Now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba, after the greatest man among the Anakim. The land had rest from war."
6,15,1,"The lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was to the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south."

6,17,7,"The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem. The border went along to the right hand, to the inhabitants of En Tappuah."

6,17,16,"The children of Joseph said, The hill country is not enough for us. All the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth Shean and its towns, and those who are in the valley of Jezreel."
6,17,17,"Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, You are a great people, and have great power. You shall not have one lot only;"
6,17,18,"but the hill country shall be yours. Although it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and it's farthest extent shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong."
6,18,1,"The whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the Tent of Meeting there. The land was subdued before them."
6,18,2,"Seven tribes remained among the children of Israel, which had not yet divided their inheritance."

6,18,6,"You shall survey the land into seven parts, and bring the description here to me; and I will cast lots for you here before the"
6,18,7,"For the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood of the"

6,18,9,"The men went and passed through the land, and surveyed it by cities into seven portions in a book. They came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh."
6,18,10,"Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the"
6,18,11,"The lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families. The border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph."
6,18,12,"Their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan. The border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward. It ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven."
6,18,13,"The border passed along from there to Luz, to the side of Luz (the same is Bethel), southward. The border went down to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth Horon the lower."
6,18,14,"The border extended, and turned around on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before Beth Horon southward; and ended at Kiriath Baal (the same is Kiriath Jearim), a city of the children of Judah. This was the west quarter."
6,18,15,"The south quarter was from the farthest part of Kiriath Jearim. The border went out westward, and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah."
6,18,16,"The border went down to the farthest part of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward. It went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En Rogel."
6,18,17,"It extended northward, went out at En Shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim. It went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben."
6,18,18,"It passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward, and went down to the Arabah."
6,18,19,"The border passed along to the side of Beth Hoglah northward; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the south border."
6,18,20,"The Jordan was its border on the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the borders around it, according to their families."
6,18,21,"Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz,"
6,18,22,"Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,"

6,19,9,"Out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them. Therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance."
6,19,10,"The third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families. The border of their inheritance was to Sarid."
6,19,11,"Their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth. It reached to the brook that is before Jokneam."

7,3,30,"So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. The land had rest eighty years."
7,3,31,"After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck of the Philistines six hundred men with an oxgoad: and he also saved Israel."
7,4,1,"The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the"
7,4,2,"The"
7,4,3,"The children of Israel cried to the"
7,4,4,"Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time."
7,4,5,"She lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment."
7,4,6,"She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, Hasn't the"
7,4,7,"I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.'"
7,4,8,"Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go."
7,4,9,"She said, I will surely go with you: nevertheless, the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; for the"
7,4,10,"Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him."
7,4,11,"Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh."
7,4,12,"They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor."
7,4,13,"Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon."
7,4,14,"Deborah said to Barak, Go; for this is the day in which the"
7,4,15,"The"
7,4,16,"But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left."
7,4,17,"However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite."
7,4,18,"Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; do not be afraid. He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug."
7,4,19,"He said to her, Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.She opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him."
7,4,20,"He said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man comes and inquires of you, and says, 'Is there any man here?' that you shall say, 'No.'"
7,4,21,"Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died."
7,4,22,"Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek. He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples."
7,4,23,"So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel."
7,4,24,"The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan."
7,5,1,"Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,"
7,5,2,"Because the leaders took the lead in Israel,because the people offered themselves willingly,be blessed,"
7,5,3,"Hear, you kings!Give ear, you princes!I, even I, will sing to the"
7,5,4,""
7,5,5,"The mountains quaked at the presence of the"
7,5,6,"In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied.The travelers walked through byways."
7,5,7,"The rulers ceased in Israel.They ceased until I, Deborah, arose;Until I arose a mother in Israel."
7,5,8,"They chose new gods.Then war was in the gates.Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?"
7,5,9,"My heart is toward the leaders of Israel,who offered themselves willingly among the people.Bless the"
7,5,10,"Speak, you who ride on white donkeys,you who sit on rich carpets,and you who walk by the way."
7,5,11,"Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water,there they will rehearse the righteous acts of the"
7,5,12,"'Awake, awake, Deborah!Awake, awake, utter a song!Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.'"
7,5,13,"Then a remnant of the nobles and the people came down.The"
7,5,14,"Those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim,after you, Benjamin, among your peoples; out of Machir leaders came down, and out of Zebulun those that handle the staff of office."
7,5,15,"And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah.As was Issachar, so was Barak.They rushed into the valley at his feet.By the watercourses of Reuben,there were great resolves of heart."
7,5,16,"Why did you sit among the sheepfolds,to hear the whistling for the flocks?At the watercourses of ReubenThere were great searchings of heart."
7,5,17,"Gilead lived beyond the Jordan.Why did Dan remain in ships?Asher sat still at the haven of the sea,and lived by his harbors."
7,5,18,"Zebulun was a people that risked their lives even to death;Naphtali also, on the high places of the field."
7,5,19,"The kings came and fought,then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo.They took no plunder of silver."
7,5,20,"From the sky the stars fought.From their courses, they fought against Sisera."
7,5,21,"The river Kishon swept them away,that ancient river, the river Kishon.My soul, march on with strength."
7,5,22,"Then the horse hoofs stamped because of the prancings,the prancings of their strong ones."
7,5,23,"Curse Meroz, said the angel of the"
7,5,24,"Jael shall be blessed above women,the wife of Heber the Kenite;blessed shall she be above women in the tent."
7,5,25,"He asked for water.She gave him milk.She brought him butter in a princely bowl."
7,5,26,"She put her hand to the tent peg,and her right hand to the workmen's hammer.With the hammer she struck Sisera.She struck through his head.Yes, she pierced and struck through his temple."
7,5,27,"At her feet he collapsed, he fell, he lay.At her feet he collapsed, he fell.Where he collapsed, there he fell down dead."
7,5,28,"Through the window she looked out, and cried:Sisera's mother looked through the lattice.Why is his chariot so long in coming?Why are the hoofbeats of his chariots delayed?"
7,5,29,"Her wise ladies answered her;indeed, she answers herself,"
7,5,30,"'Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil?A lady, two ladies to every man;to Sisera a spoil of dyed garments,A spoil of dyed garments embroidered,Of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, for the neck of the plunderer?'"
7,5,31,"So let all your enemies perish,"
7,6,1,"And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the"
7,6,2,"And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds."
7,6,3,"And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came up against them."
7,6,4,"And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, as far as Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, as well as sheep, or ox, or donkey."
7,6,5,"For they came up with their livestock and their tents; they would come in like locusts in number; both they and their camels were without number, and they came into the land to ravage it."
7,6,6,"Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried to the"
7,6,7,"It happened, when the children of Israel cried to the"
7,6,8,"that the"
7,6,9,"and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;"
7,6,10,"and I said to you, I am the"
7,6,11,"The angel of the"
7,6,12,"The angel of the"
7,6,13,"Gideon said to him, Oh, my lord, if the"
7,6,14,"The"
7,6,15,"He said to him, O Lord, how shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house."
7,6,16,"The"
7,6,17,"He said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight, then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me."
7,6,18,"Please do not go away, until I come to you, and bring out my present, and lay it before you.He said, I will wait until you come back."
7,6,19,"Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal: the meat he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it."
7,6,20,"The angel of God said to him, Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.And he did so."
7,6,21,"Then the angel of the"
7,6,22,"Gideon saw that he was the angel of the"
7,6,23,"The"
7,6,24,"Then Gideon built an altar there to the"
7,6,25,"It happened the same night, that the"
7,6,26,"and build an altar to the"
7,6,27,"Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the"
7,6,28,"When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bull was offered on the altar that was built."
7,6,29,"They said one to another, Who has done this thing?When they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing."
7,6,30,"Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it."
7,6,31,"Joash said to all who stood against him, Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? He who will contend for him, let him be put to death while it is yet morning: if he is a god, let him contend for himself, because someone has broken down his altar."
7,6,32,"Therefore on that day he named him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he has broken down his altar."
7,6,33,"Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they crossed over, and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel."
7,6,34,"But the Spirit of the"
7,6,35,"He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them."
7,6,36,"Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken,"
7,6,37,"behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken."
7,6,38,"It was so; for he rose up early on the next day, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water."
7,6,39,"Gideon said to God, Do not let your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Please let me make one more test with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew."
7,6,40,"God did so that night, for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew all over the ground."
7,7,1,"Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley."
7,7,2,"The"
7,7,3,"Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, 'Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.' There returned of the people twenty-two thousand; but ten thousand remained."
7,7,4,"The"
7,7,5,"So he brought down the people to the water: and the"
7,7,6,"The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: but all the rest of the people kneeled down on their knees to drink water."
7,7,7,"The"
7,7,8,"So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men. And the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley."
7,7,9,"It happened the same night, that the"
7,7,10,"But if you fear to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp:"
7,7,11,"and you shall hear what they say; and afterward will your hands be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp."
7,7,12,"The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as numerous as the sand which is on the seashore."
7,7,13,"When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his friend; and he said, Behold, I had a dream, and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent collapsed."
7,7,14,"His friend answered, This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. Into his hand God has delivered Midian, and all the army."
7,7,15,"It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and its interpretation, that he worshiped, and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Get up, for the"
7,7,16,"He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers."
7,7,17,"He said to them, Look at me, and do likewise. And behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so you shall do."
7,7,18,"When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then you blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For the"
7,7,19,"So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands."
7,7,20,"The three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow; and they called out, The sword of the"
7,7,21,"They each stood in his place every man around the camp; and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put them to flight."
7,7,22,"They blew the three hundred trumpets, and the"
7,7,23,"The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian."
7,7,24,"Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and capture the waters, as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and seized the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan."
7,7,25,"They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan."
7,8,1,"The men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you done such a thing to us, not calling us when you went to fight with Midian? And they argued with him fiercely."
7,8,2,"He said to them, What have I now done in comparison with you? Isn't the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?"
7,8,3,"God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their anger subsided toward him, when he had said that."
7,8,4,"Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men who were with him, exhausted, yet pursuing."
7,8,5,"He said to the men of Succoth, Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
7,8,6,"The princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?"
7,8,7,"Gideon said, Therefore when the"
7,8,8,"He went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered."
7,8,9,"He spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower."
7,8,10,"Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army of the children of the east; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword."
7,8,11,"And Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the army, when the army was unsuspecting."
7,8,12,"Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued after them, and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the entire army."
7,8,13,"Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres."
7,8,14,"He caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and its elders, seventy-seven men."
7,8,15,"He came to the men of Succoth, and said, Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are weary?"
7,8,16,"He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he disciplined the men of Succoth."
7,8,17,"He broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city."
7,8,18,"Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?They answered, As you are, so were they; each one resembled the son of a king."
7,8,19,"He said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the"
7,8,20,"He said to Jether his firstborn, Get up, and kill them. But the youth did not draw his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth."
7,8,21,"Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise up yourself, and kill us, for a man is judged by his strength. Gideon arose, and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels' necks."
7,8,22,"Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule over us, both you, and your son, and your son's son also; for you have saved us out of the hand of Midian."
7,8,23,"Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the"
7,8,24,"Gideon said to them, I would make a request of you, that you would give me every man the earrings from his plunder. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)"
7,8,25,"They answered, We will willingly give them. They spread a garment, and every one of them threw an earring from his plunder."
7,8,26,"The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand and seven hundred pieces of gold, besides the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels' necks."
7,8,27,"Gideon made an ephod of it, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel prostituted themselves after it there; and it became a snare to Gideon, and to his house."
7,8,28,"So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and did not become a threat again. The land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon."
7,8,29,"Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house."
7,8,30,"Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body; for he had many wives."
7,8,31,"His concubine who was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech."
7,8,32,"Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites."
7,8,33,"It happened, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and played the prostitute after the Baals, and made Baal Berith their god."
7,8,34,"The children of Israel did not remember the"
7,8,35,"neither did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel."
7,9,1,"Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's brothers, and spoke with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,"
7,9,2,"Please speak in the ears of all the men of Shechem, 'Is it better for you that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you?' Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.'"
7,9,3,"His mother's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother."
7,9,4,"They gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal Berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him."
7,9,5,"He went to his father's house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself."
7,9,6,"All the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem."
7,9,7,"When they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said to them, Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God may listen to you."
7,9,8,"The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, 'Reign you over us.'"
7,9,9,"But the olive tree said to them, 'Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?'"
7,9,10,"The trees said to the fig tree, 'Come, and reign over us.'"
7,9,11,"But the fig tree said to them, 'Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?'"
7,9,12,"The trees said to the vine, 'Come, and reign over us.'"
7,9,13,"The vine said to them, 'Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?'"
7,9,14,"Then all the trees said to the bramble, 'Come, and reign over us.'"
7,9,15,"The bramble said to the trees, 'If in truth you anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.'"
7,9,16,"Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and righteously, in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands"
7,9,17,"(for my father fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:"
7,9,18,"and you are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy persons, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother)."
7,9,19,"If you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice you in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:"
7,9,20,"but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech."
7,9,21,"And Jotham escaped and fled and went to Beer and lived there, for fear of Abimelech his brother."
7,9,22,"Abimelech was prince over Israel three years."
7,9,23,"God sent a spirit of hostility between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:"
7,9,24,"that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers."
7,9,25,"The men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who came along that way by them. And it was told to Abimelech."
7,9,26,"Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him."
7,9,27,"They went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech."
7,9,28,"Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Isn't he the son of Jerubbaal, and Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem. But why should we serve him?"
7,9,29,"Would that this people were under my hand! Then would I remove Abimelech. He said to Abimelech, Increase your army, and come out."
7,9,30,"When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled."
7,9,31,"He sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers are come to Shechem; and behold, they constrain the city to take part against you."
7,9,32,"Now therefore, rise up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field."
7,9,33,"And it shall be that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early, and rush on the city. And behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, then do whatever you can to them."
7,9,34,"Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night, and they lay in wait against Shechem in four companies."
7,9,35,"Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people who were with him, from the ambush."
7,9,36,"When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there are people coming down from the tops of the mountains.Zebul said to him, You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men."
7,9,37,"Gaal spoke again and said, Behold, there are people coming down by the central part of the land, and one company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim."
7,9,38,"Then Zebul said to him, Where is now your mouth, that you said, 'Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?' Is not this the people that you have despised? Please go out now and fight with them."
7,9,39,"Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech."
7,9,40,"Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even to the entrance of the gate."
7,9,41,"Abimelech lived at Arumah: and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem."
7,9,42,"It happened on the next day, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech."
7,9,43,"He took the people, and divided them into three companies, and waited in ambush in the field; and he looked, and behold, the people came forth out of the city. He rose up against them, and struck them."
7,9,44,"Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two companies rushed against all who were in the field, and struck them."
7,9,45,"Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and killed the people who were in it. And he destroyed the city, and sowed it with salt."
7,9,46,"When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of El Berith."
7,9,47,"It was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together."
7,9,48,"Abimelech got him up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a branch from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the people who were with him, What you have seen me do, do quickly, and do as I have done."
7,9,49,"All the people likewise cut down his branch and followed Abimelech, and put them on the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire on them; so that all the men of the Tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women."
7,9,50,"Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it."
7,9,51,"But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women fled, and all those of the city, and shut themselves in, and got them up to the roof of the tower."
7,9,52,"Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire."
7,9,53,"A certain woman threw down an upper millstone on Abimelech's head, and broke his skull."
7,9,54,"Then he called quickly to the young man his armor bearer, and said to him, Draw your sword, and kill me, that men not say of me, 'A woman killed him.' So the young man thrust him through, and he died."
7,9,55,"When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place."
7,9,56,"Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in killing his seventy brothers;"
7,9,57,"and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God return on their heads, and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal."
7,10,1,"After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim."
7,10,2,"He judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir."
7,10,3,"After him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty-two years."
7,10,4,"He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth Jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead."
7,10,5,"Jair died, and was buried in Kamon."
7,10,6,"The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the"
7,10,7,"The anger of the"
7,10,8,"They troubled and oppressed the children of Israel that year. Eighteen years they oppressed all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead."
7,10,9,"The children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was very distressed."
7,10,10,"The children of Israel cried to the"
7,10,11,"The"
7,10,12,"The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand."
7,10,13,"Yet you have forsaken me, and served other gods. Therefore I will save you no more."
7,10,14,"Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress."
7,10,15,"The children of Israel said to the"
7,10,16,"They put away the foreign gods from among them, and served the"
7,10,17,"Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. The children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped at Mizpah."
7,10,18,"The people, the rulers of Gilead, said to each other, What man is he who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
7,11,1,"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a prostitute. And Gilead became the father of Jephthah."
7,11,2,"Gilead's wife bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said to him, You shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of another woman."
7,11,3,"Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him."
7,11,4,"It happened after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel."
7,11,5,"It was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob;"
7,11,6,"and they said to Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon."
7,11,7,"Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did you not hate me, and drive me out of my father's house? And why have you come to me now when you are in distress?"
7,11,8,"The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and you shall be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
7,11,9,"Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and the"
7,11,10,"The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, The"
7,11,11,"Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them. And Jephthah spoke all his words before the"
7,11,12,"Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come to me to fight against my land?"
7,11,13,"The king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan. Now therefore restore it peaceably."
7,11,14,"Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon;"
7,11,15,"and he said to him, Thus says Jephthah: 'Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon,"
7,11,16,"but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;"
7,11,17,"then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Please let me pass through your land.' But the king of Edom did not listen. In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not. So Israel stayed in Kadesh."
7,11,18,"Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they did not come within the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the boundary of Moab."
7,11,19,"Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Please let us pass through your land to our land.'"
7,11,20,"But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel."
7,11,21,"The"
7,11,22,"They possessed all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan."
7,11,23,"So now the"
7,11,24,"Won't you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever the"
7,11,25,"And now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever contend against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?"
7,11,26,"While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; why did you not recover them within that time?"
7,11,27,"I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong by making war against me. The"
7,11,28,"However the king of the children of Ammon did not listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him."
7,11,29,"Then the Spirit of the"
7,11,30,"Jephthah made a vow to the"
7,11,31,"then it shall be that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be the"
7,11,32,"So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the"
7,11,33,"He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel."
7,11,34,"Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter."
7,11,35,"It happened, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have given my word to the"
7,11,36,"She said to him, My father, since you have given your word to the"
7,11,37,"She said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: leave me alone two months, that I may depart and go down on the mountains, and weep because of my virginity, I and my companions."
7,11,38,"He said, Go. He sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and wept because of her virginity on the mountains."
7,11,39,"It happened at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to what he had vowed. And she was a virgin. It became a custom in Israel,"
7,11,40,"that the daughters of Israel went yearly four days in a year to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite."
7,12,1,"The men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said to Jephthah, Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house on you with fire."
7,12,2,"Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you did not save me out of their hand."
7,12,3,"When I saw that you did not save me, I put my life in my own hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the"
7,12,4,"Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh."
7,12,5,"The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. It was so, that when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said to him, Are you an Ephraimite? If he said, No;"
7,12,6,"then they said to him, Now say 'Shibboleth;' and he said Sibboleth; for he couldn't manage to pronounce it right: then they seized him, and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. There fell at that time of Ephraim forty-two thousand."
7,12,7,"Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead."
7,12,8,"After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel."
7,12,9,"He had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. He judged Israel seven years."
7,12,10,"Ibzan died, and was buried at Bethlehem."
7,12,11,"After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years."
7,12,12,"Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun."
7,12,13,"After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel."
7,12,14,"He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkey colts. And he judged Israel eight years."
7,12,15,"Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites."
7,13,1,"The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the"
7,13,2,"There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and did not bear. ."
7,13,3,"The angel of the"
7,13,4,"Now therefore please be careful and drink no wine nor strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing."
7,13,5,"For behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb. And he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines."
7,13,6,"Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his face was like the face of the angel of God, very awesome; and I didn't ask him where he was from, neither did he tell me his name,"
7,13,7,"but he said to me, 'Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son. And now drink no wine nor strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb until the day of his death.'"
7,13,8,"Then Manoah entreated the"
7,13,9,"God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah, her husband, wasn't with her."
7,13,10,"The woman ran quickly, and told her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me."
7,13,11,"Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Are you the man who spoke to the woman? He said, I am."
7,13,12,"Manoah said, Now let your words happen. How shall the child be raised and what is he to do?"
7,13,13,"The angel of the"
7,13,14,"She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. All that I have commanded her she is to observe."
7,13,15,"Manoah said to the angel of the"
7,13,16,"The angel of the"
7,13,17,"Manoah said to the angel of the"
7,13,18,"And the angel of the"
7,13,19,"So Manoah took the young goat and a grain offering, and offered it on the rock to the"
7,13,20,"For it happened, when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar, that the angel of the"
7,13,21,"But the angel of the"
7,13,22,"Manoah said to his wife, :We shall surely die, because we have seen God."
7,13,23,"But his wife said to him, If the"
7,13,24,"The woman bore a son, and named him Samson. And the child grew, and the"
7,13,25,"And the Spirit of the"
7,14,1,"Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines."
7,14,2,"He came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. Now therefore get her for me as wife."
7,14,3,"Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there not a woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me, for she is the right one for me."
7,14,4,"But his father and his mother did not know that it was of the"
7,14,5,"Then Samson went down with his father and his mother to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion roared against him."
7,14,6,"And the Spirit of the"
7,14,7,"He went down and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson."
7,14,8,"After a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey."
7,14,9,"He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went. And he came to his father and mother, and gave to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion."
7,14,10,"His father went down to the woman, and Samson made a feast there, since young men used to do so."
7,14,11,"It happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him."
7,14,12,"Samson said to them, Let me now put forth a riddle to you. If you can explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, and figure it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing."
7,14,13,"But if you can't explain it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing. And they said to him, Propose your riddle, we want to hear it."
7,14,14,"He said to them,Out of the eater came forth food.Out of the strong came forth sweetness.They couldn't in three days declare the riddle."
7,14,15,"And it happened on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Entice your husband, that he may tell us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Is it not so?"
7,14,16,"Samson's wife wept before him, and said, You just hate me, and do not love me. You have put forth a riddle to the children of my people, and haven't told it me.And he said to her, Behold, I haven't told it to my father or my mother, and shall I tell you?"
7,14,17,"She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it happened on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people."
7,14,18,"The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?He said to them,If you hadn't plowed with my heifer,you wouldn't have found out my riddle."
7,14,19,"The Spirit of the"
7,14,20,"But Samson's wife was given to his companion, who had been his friend."
7,15,1,"But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a young goat; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the room.But her father wouldn't allow him to go in."
7,15,2,"Her father said, I most certainly thought that you had utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Isn't her younger sister more beautiful than she is? Please take her, instead."
7,15,3,"Samson said to them, This time I will be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I harm them."
7,15,4,"Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the midst between every two tails."
7,15,5,"When he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves."
7,15,6,"Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? They said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife, and given her to his companion. The Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire."
7,15,7,"Samson said to them, If you behave like this, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease."
7,15,8,"He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam."
7,15,9,"Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi."
7,15,10,"The men of Judah said, Why have you come up against us? They said, We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us."
7,15,11,"Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?He said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them."
7,15,12,"They said to him, We have come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.Samson said to them, Swear to me that you will not fall on me yourselves."
7,15,13,"They spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand; but surely we will not kill you. They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock."
7,15,14,"When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Spirit of the"
7,15,15,"And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and reached down and took it, and struck a thousand men with it."
7,15,16,"Samson said, With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps; with the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand men."
7,15,17,"It happened, when he had finished speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath Lehi."
7,15,18,"He was very thirsty, and called on the"
7,15,19,"And God split the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out of it. When he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: therefore its name was called En Hakore, which is in Lehi, to this day."
7,15,20,"He judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years."
7,16,1,"Samson went to Gaza, and saw a prostitute there, and went in to her."
7,16,2,"The Gazites were told, Samson is here! They surrounded him, and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city, and were quiet all night, saying, Wait until morning light, then we will kill him."
7,16,3,"Samson stayed in bed until midnight, and arose at midnight, and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is overlooking Hebron."
7,16,4,"It came to pass afterward, that he fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah."
7,16,5,"The lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, Entice him, and see in which his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver."
7,16,6,"Delilah said to Samson, Please tell me where your great strength lies, and how you can be bound and subdued."
7,16,7,"Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man."
7,16,8,"Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them."
7,16,9,"Now she had an ambush waiting in the inner room. She said to him, The Philistines are on you, Samson! He broke the cords, as a string of tow is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known."
7,16,10,"Delilah said to Samson, Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies: now please tell me with which you might be bound."
7,16,11,"He said to her, If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man."
7,16,12,"So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said to him, The Philistines are on you, Samson! The ambush was waiting in the inner room. He broke them off his arms like a thread."
7,16,13,"Delilah said to Samson, Until now, you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what you might be bound.He said to her, If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web."
7,16,14,"She fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines are on you, Samson! He awakened out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web."
7,16,15,"She said to him, How can you say, 'I love you,' when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength lies."
7,16,16,"It happened, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was troubled to death."
7,16,17,"He told her all his heart, and said to her, No razor has ever come on my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I will become weak, and be like any other man."
7,16,18,"When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in their hand."
7,16,19,"She made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him."
7,16,20,"She said, The Philistines are upon you, Samson!He awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free. But he didn't know that the"
7,16,21,"The Philistines seized him, and put out his eyes. And they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with bronze shackles, and he ground at the mill in the prison."
7,16,22,"However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved."
7,16,23,"The lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to celebrate; for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand."
7,16,24,"When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, Our god has delivered our enemy and the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us, into our hand."
7,16,25,"It happened, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may entertain us. They called for Samson out of the prison; and he performed before them. They set him between the pillars;"
7,16,26,"and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, Allow me to feel the pillars whereupon the house rests, that I may lean on them."
7,16,27,"Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women, who saw while Samson made sport."
7,16,28,"Samson called to the"
7,16,29,"Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and leaned on them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left."
7,16,30,"Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines! He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people who were therein. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than those who he killed in his life."
7,16,31,"Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah his father. He judged Israel twenty years."
7,17,1,"There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. ."
7,17,2,"He said to his mother, The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.His mother said, Blessed be my son of the"
7,17,3,"He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I most certainly dedicate the silver to the"
7,17,4,"When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made of it an engraved image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah."
7,17,5,"The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest."
7,17,6,"In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes."
7,17,7,"There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he lived there."
7,17,8,"The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah, to live where he could find a place, and he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he traveled."
7,17,9,"Micah said to him, Where did you come from?He said to him, I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I am looking for a place to live."
7,17,10,"Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver by the year, and a suit of clothing, and your food. So the Levite went in."
7,17,11,"The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons."
7,17,12,"Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah."
7,17,13,"Then Micah said, Now I know that the"
7,18,1,"In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was looking for an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day, their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel."
7,18,2,"The children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, explore the land! They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and stayed there."
7,18,3,"When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned in that direction, and said to him, Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? And what is your business here?"
7,18,4,"He said to them, Thus and so has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I have become his priest."
7,18,5,"They said to him, Please ask counsel of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous."
7,18,6,"The priest said to them, Go in peace. The"
7,18,7,"Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people who were there, and how they lived in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no one in the land possessing authority that might trouble them in anyway, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with anyone."
7,18,8,"They came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brothers said to them, What do you say?"
7,18,9,"They said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. Will you do nothing? Do not hesitate to go and to enter in to possess the land."
7,18,10,"When you go, you shall come to a secure people, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is on the earth."
7,18,11,"Then the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men armed with weapons of war, set forth from there."
7,18,12,"They went up, and encamped in Kiriath Jearim, in Judah. Therefore they called that place Mahaneh Dan to this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim."
7,18,13,"They passed there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah."
7,18,14,"Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered, and said to their brothers, Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and an engraved image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you have to do."
7,18,15,"They turned aside there, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare."
7,18,16,"The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate."
7,18,17,"The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war."
7,18,18,"When these went into Micah's house, and took the engraved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, What are you doing?"
7,18,19,"They said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?"
7,18,20,"The priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went in the midst of the people."
7,18,21,"So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the livestock and the goods before them."
7,18,22,"When they were some distance from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan."
7,18,23,"They cried to the children of Dan. They turned their faces, and said to Micah, What's wrong with you, that you come with such a company?"
7,18,24,"He said, You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away, and what more do I have? How then do you say to me, 'What's wrong with you?'"
7,18,25,"The children of Dan said to him, Do not let your voice be heard among us, or angry men will attack you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household."
7,18,26,"The children of Dan went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house."
7,18,27,"They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire."
7,18,28,"There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone, and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built the city, and lived there."
7,18,29,"They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel. However the name of the city was originally Laish."
7,18,30,"The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image. And Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the exile from the land."
7,18,31,"So they set up for themselves Micah's engraved image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh."
7,19,1,"It happened in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim, who took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem Judah."
7,19,2,"His concubine was unfaithful to him and went away from him to her father's house in Bethlehem of Judah, and was there about four months."
7,19,3,"Her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of donkeys. And she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced to meet him."
7,19,4,"His father-in-law, the young lady's father, welcomed him; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank and stayed there."
7,19,5,"It happened on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the young lady's father said to his son-in-law, Refresh yourself with a piece of bread, and after that you may go."
7,19,6,"So they sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together. Then the young lady's father said to the man, Please agree to stay the night, and enjoy yourself."
7,19,7,"The man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he stayed there again."
7,19,8,"He arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the young lady's father said, Please refresh yourself and stay until the day declines. And they both ate."
7,19,9,"When the man rose up with his concubine and his servant to leave, his father-in-law, the young lady's father, said to him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening, please stay the night. Behold, the day grows to an end, stay here, and enjoy yourself; and tomorrow you can get up early for your journey so that you may go home."
7,19,10,"But the man wouldn't stay that night, but he rose up and departed, and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). And there were with him a couple of saddled donkeys, and his concubine was also with him."
7,19,11,"When they were by Jebus, the day was almost gone, and the servant said to his master, Please come and let us stop at this city of the Jebusites, and spend the night in it."
7,19,12,"His master said to him, We won't go into the city of a foreigner that is not of the children of Israel, but we will pass over to Gibeah."
7,19,13,"He said to his servant, Come and let us try to reach one of those places and we will spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah."
7,19,14,"So they passed on and went their way; and the sun set on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin."
7,19,15,"They turned that way to go in to spend the night in Gibeah. And he went in and they sat down in the street of the city; for there was no one who would take them into their house to spend the night."
7,19,16,"Behold, there came an old man from his work out in the field at evening. Now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim, and he was residing in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites."
7,19,17,"He lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Where are you going? Where did you come from?"
7,19,18,"He said to him, We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim. I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem in Judah. I am going to the house of the"
7,19,19,"Yet there is both straw and feed for our donkeys, and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your female servant, and for the young man who is with your servants. There is no lack of anything."
7,19,20,"And the old man said, Peace be to you. I will take care of all your needs; however, do not spend the night in the square."
7,19,21,"So he brought him into his house, and fed the donkeys. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank."
7,19,22,"As they were enjoying themselves, behold, the men of the city, some wicked men of the city surrounded the house, beating at the door. And they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring out the man who came into your house, that we may have sex with him!"
7,19,23,"The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, No, my brothers, please do not act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house. Do not do this folly."
7,19,24,"Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. I will bring them out now. Ravish them and do with them what seems good to you; but do not do any such a disgraceful thing to this man."
7,19,25,"But the men wouldn't listen to him: so the man laid hold of his concubine, and brought her out to them. And they raped her and abused her all night until the morning, and when the day began to dawn they let her go."
7,19,26,"Then at daybreak the woman arrived and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, until daylight."
7,19,27,"Her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold."
7,19,28,"He said to her, Get up, and let us go! But no one answered. Then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up, and went to his place."
7,19,29,"When he had come into his house, he took a knife, and took hold of his concubine and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel."
7,19,30,"It was so, that all who saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day! Consider it, take counsel, and speak."
7,20,1,"Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to the"
7,20,2,"The leaders of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword."
7,20,3,"(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) The children of Israel said, Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?"
7,20,4,"The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered, I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night."
7,20,5,"The men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house at night. They intended to kill me, and they raped my concubine, and she is dead."
7,20,6,"I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed wickedness and disgrace in Israel."
7,20,7,"Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give your advice and counsel here."
7,20,8,"All the people arose as one man, saying, None of us will go to his tent, neither will any of us return to his house."
7,20,9,"But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot;"
7,20,10,"and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get food for the people, that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may do to it according to all the disgrace that they have committed in Israel."
7,20,11,"So all the men of Israel gathered against the city, united as one man."
7,20,12,"The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that has happened among you?"
7,20,13,"Now therefore deliver up the men, the wicked men who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the children of Israel."
7,20,14,"The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel."
7,20,15,"The children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men."
7,20,16,"Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left-handed; everyone could sling stones at a hair and not miss."
7,20,17,"The men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men who drew sword: all these were men of war."
7,20,18,"The children of Israel arose, and went up to Bethel, and asked counsel of God; and they said, Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin?The"
7,20,19,"The children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah."
7,20,20,"The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah."
7,20,21,"The children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day Twenty-two thousand men."
7,20,22,"The people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day."
7,20,23,"The children of Israel went up and wept before the"
7,20,24,"The children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day."
7,20,25,"Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword."
7,20,26,"Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before the"
7,20,27,"The children of Israel asked of the"
7,20,28,"and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?The"
7,20,29,"Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah."
7,20,30,"The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times."
7,20,31,"The children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill some of the people, as at other times, on the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel."
7,20,32,"The children of Benjamin said, They are defeated before us, as previously. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways."
7,20,33,"All the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar. And the men of Israel in ambush rushed out of their place, even out of Maareh Geba."
7,20,34,"There came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe; but they didn't know that disaster was close upon them."
7,20,35,"The"
7,20,36,"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were defeated; for the men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin, because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah."
7,20,37,"The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the ambushers drew themselves along, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword."
7,20,38,"Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city."
7,20,39,"The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle."
7,20,40,"But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold, the whole city went up in smoke into the sky."
7,20,41,"The men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were terrified; for they saw that disaster had come on them."
7,20,42,"Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its midst."
7,20,43,"They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, and overtook them opposite Gibeah toward the east."
7,20,44,"There fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor."
7,20,45,"They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they killed on the highways five thousand men, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck down two thousand men."
7,20,46,"So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand swordsmen; all these were valiant fighters."
7,20,47,"But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four months."
7,20,48,"The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the livestock, and all that they found: moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire."
7,21,1,"Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife."
7,21,2,"The people came to Bethel, and sat there until evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept severely."
7,21,3,"They said, "
7,21,4,"It happened on the next day that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings."
7,21,5,"The children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up in the assembly to the"
7,21,6,"The children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day."
7,21,7,"How shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the"
7,21,8,"They said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the"
7,21,9,"For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there."
7,21,10,"The congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones."
7,21,11,"This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has slept with a man."
7,21,12,"They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had never slept with a man; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan."
7,21,13,"The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them."
7,21,14,"Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead: and yet so they weren't enough for them."
7,21,15,"The people grieved for Benjamin, because the"
7,21,16,"Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?"
7,21,17,"They said, There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel."
7,21,18,"However we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, 'Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.'"
7,21,19,"They said, Behold, there is a feast of the"
7,21,20,"They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,"
7,21,21,"and watch. If the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each man catch his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin."
7,21,22,"It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, 'Grant them graciously to us, because we didn't take wives for each man in battle, neither did you give them to them, otherwise you would now be guilty.'"
7,21,23,"The children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off. They went and returned to their inheritance, built the cities, and lived in them."
7,21,24,"The children of Israel departed there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance."
7,21,25,"In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes."
8,1,1,"It happened in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. A certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons."
8,1,2,"The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah. They came into the country of Moab, and continued there."
8,1,3,"Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons."
8,1,4,"And they took for themselves wives from the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they lived there about ten years."
8,1,5,"Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband."
8,1,6,"Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the"
8,1,7,"She went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah."
8,1,8,"Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother's house: the"
8,1,9,"The"
8,1,10,"They said to her, No, but we will return with you to your people."
8,1,11,"Naomi said, Go back, my daughters. Why do you want to go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?"
8,1,12,"Go back, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, 'I have hope,' if I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons;"
8,1,13,"would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from having husbands? No, my daughters, for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of the"
8,1,14,"They lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth joined with her."
8,1,15,"She said, Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people, and to her god. Follow your sister-in-law."
8,1,16,"Ruth said, Do not urge me to leave you, and to return from following after you, for where you go, I will go; and where you stay, I will stay; your people shall be my people, and your God my God;"
8,1,17,"where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried. The"
8,1,18,"When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking to her."
8,1,19,"So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. It happened, when they had come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they asked, Is this Naomi?"
8,1,20,"She said to them, Do not call me Naomi. Call me Marah; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me."
8,1,21,"I went out full, and the"
8,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest."
8,2,1,"Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz."
8,2,2,"Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor.She said to her, Go, my daughter."
8,2,3,"She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech."
8,2,4,"Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, The"
8,2,5,"Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose young lady is this?"
8,2,6,"The servant who was set over the reapers answered, It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab."
8,2,7,"She said, 'Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.' So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little in the house."
8,2,8,"Then Boaz said to Ruth, Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field, and do not go from here, but stay here close to my maidens."
8,2,9,"Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven't I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn."
8,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?"
8,2,11,"Boaz answered her, It has fully been shown to me, all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn't know before."
8,2,12,"May the"
8,2,13,"Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens."
8,2,14,"At meal time Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. She sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left some of it."
8,2,15,"When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her."
8,2,16,"Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and do not rebuke her."
8,2,17,"So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley."
8,2,18,"She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed."
8,2,19,"Her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? And where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you. She showed her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz."
8,2,20,"Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of the"
8,2,21,"Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, 'You shall stay close to my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.'"
8,2,22,"Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field."
8,2,23,"So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law."
8,3,1,"Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?"
8,3,2,"Now isn't Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he winnows barley tonight at the threshing floor."
8,3,3,"Therefore wash yourself, anoint yourself, get dressed, and go down to the threshing floor, but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking."
8,3,4,"It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lie down; then he will tell you what you shall do."
8,3,5,"She said to her, All that you say I will do."
8,3,6,"She went down to the threshing floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law told her."
8,3,7,"When Boaz had eaten and drank, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. She came quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down."
8,3,8,"It happened at midnight, that the man was startled and turned over; and behold, a woman lay at his feet."
8,3,9,"He said, Who are you?She answered, I am Ruth your handmaid. Therefore spread the corner of your garment over your handmaid; for you are a redeeming kinsman."
8,3,10,"He said, Blessed are you by the"
8,3,11,"Now, my daughter, do not be afraid; I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman."
8,3,12,"Now it is true that I am a redeeming kinsman; however there is a redeemer closer than I am."
8,3,13,"Stay this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform for you the part of a redeemer, well; let him do the redeemer's part. But if he will not do the part of a redeemer for you, then I will do the part of a redeemer for you, as the"
8,3,14,"She lay at his feet until the morning. She rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor."
8,3,15,"He said, Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it. She held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her; and he went into the city."
8,3,16,"When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, How did it go, my daughter?She told her all that the man had done to her."
8,3,17,"She said, He gave me these six measures of barley; for he said, 'Do not go empty to your mother-in-law.'"
8,3,18,"Then she said, Wait, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he has finished the thing this day."
8,4,1,"Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there. Behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Come over here, friend, and sit down! He turned aside, and sat down."
8,4,2,"He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit down here. They sat down."
8,4,3,"He said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's."
8,4,4,"I thought to disclose it to you, saying, 'Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people.' If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know. For there is no one to redeem it besides you; and I am after you.He said, I will redeem it."
8,4,5,"Then Boaz said, On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance."
8,4,6,"The near kinsman said, I can't redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption for yourself; for I can't redeem it."
8,4,7,"Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man took off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the way of attestation in Israel."
8,4,8,"So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself. He took off his shoe."
8,4,9,"Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, from the hand of Naomi."
8,4,10,"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses this day."
8,4,11,"All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. May the"
8,4,12,"Let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which the"
8,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and the"
8,4,14,"The women said to Naomi, Blessed be the"
8,4,15,"He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him."
8,4,16,"Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and looked after him."
8,4,17,"The women, her neighbors, gave him a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi. And they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David."
8,4,18,"Now this is the history of the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron,"
8,4,19,"and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab,"
8,4,20,"and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,"
8,4,21,"and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed,"
8,4,22,"and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David."
9,1,1,"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:"
9,1,2,"and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."
9,1,3,"This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to the"
9,1,4,"When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:"
9,1,5,"but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but the"
9,1,6,"Her rival taunted her severely, to irritate her, because the"
9,1,7,"As he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the"
9,1,8,"Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?"
9,1,9,"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drank. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the"
9,1,10,"She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the"
9,1,11,"She vowed a vow, and said, "
9,1,12,"It happened, as she continued praying before the"
9,1,13,"Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk."
9,1,14,"Eli said to her, How long will you make yourself drunk? Put away your wine from you."
9,1,15,"Hannah answered, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before the"
9,1,16,"Do not count your handmaid as a worthless woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my distress and my anguish."
9,1,17,"Then Eli answered, Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him."
9,1,18,"She said, Let your handmaid find favor in your sight. So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression wasn't sad any more."
9,1,19,"They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before the"
9,1,20,"It happened, when the time had come, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the"
9,1,21,"The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the"
9,1,22,"But Hannah did not go up; for she said to her husband, Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before the"
9,1,23,"Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the"
9,1,24,"When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with a three year old bull, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the"
9,1,25,"They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli."
9,1,26,"She said, Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to the"
9,1,27,"For this child I prayed; and the"
9,1,28,"Therefore also I have granted him to the"
9,2,1,"Hannah prayed, and said:My heart exults in the"

9,2,10,"Those who strive with the"
9,2,11,"Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child served the"
9,2,12,"Now the sons of Eli were base men; they did not know the"
9,2,13,"The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;"
9,2,14,"and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there."
9,2,15,"Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw."
9,2,16,"If the man said to him, Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would say, No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force."
9,2,17,"The sin of the young men was very great before the"
9,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before the"
9,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice."
9,2,20,"Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The"
9,2,21,"The"
9,2,22,"Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting."
9,2,23,"He said to them, Why do you do such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people."
9,2,24,"No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make the"
9,2,25,"If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against the"
9,2,26,"The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with the"
9,2,27,"A man of God came to Eli, and said to him, Thus says the"
9,2,28,"And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me. And I gave to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire."
9,2,29,"Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?'"
9,2,30,"Therefore the"
9,2,31,"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man in your house."
9,2,32,"You shall see the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which I shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever."
9,2,33,"The man of yours, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall consume your eyes, and grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age."
9,2,34,"'This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall both die."
9,2,35,"I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed forever."
9,2,36,"It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Please put me into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.'"
9,3,1,"The child Samuel ministered to the"
9,3,2,"It happened at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),"
9,3,3,"and the lamp of God hadn't yet gone out, and Samuel had lain down in the"
9,3,4,"that the"
9,3,5,"He ran to Eli, and said, Here I am; for you called me.He said, I did not call; lie down again.He went and lay down."
9,3,6,"The"
9,3,7,"Now Samuel did not yet know the"
9,3,8,"The"
9,3,9,"Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he calls you, that you shall say, 'Speak,"
9,3,10,"The"
9,3,11,"The"
9,3,12,"In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end."
9,3,13,"For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he did not restrain them."
9,3,14,"Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be removed with sacrifice nor offering forever."
9,3,15,"Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the"
9,3,16,"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son!He said, Here I am."
9,3,17,"He said, What is the thing that he has spoken to you? Please do not hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you."
9,3,18,"Samuel told him every bit, and hid nothing from him.He said, It is the"
9,3,19,"Samuel grew, and the"
9,3,20,"All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the"
9,3,21,"The"
9,4,1,"The word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek."
9,4,2,"The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was struck before the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men."
9,4,3,"When the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has the"
9,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of the"
9,4,5,"When the ark of the covenant of the"
9,4,6,"When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean? They understood that the ark of the"
9,4,7,"The Philistines were afraid, for they said, God has come into the camp. They said, Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing before."
9,4,8,"Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness."
9,4,9,"Be strong, and behave like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Strengthen yourselves like men, and fight!"
9,4,10,"The Philistines fought, and Israel was struck, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen."
9,4,11,"The ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain."
9,4,12,"There ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and with earth on his head."
9,4,13,"When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. When the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out."
9,4,14,"When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What does the noise of this tumult mean?The man hurried, and came and told Eli."
9,4,15,"Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see."
9,4,16,"The man said to Eli, I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army.He said, How did the matter go, my son?"
9,4,17,"He who brought the news answered, Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured."
9,4,18,"It happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an old man, and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years."
9,4,19,"His daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered. When she heard the news that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth; for her pains came on her."
9,4,20,"About the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, Do not be afraid; for you have given birth to a son. But she did not answer, neither did she regard it."
9,4,21,"She named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory has departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband."
9,4,22,"She said, The glory has departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken."
9,5,1,"Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod."
9,5,2,"The Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon."
9,5,3,"When they of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the"
9,5,4,"When they arose early on the next day morning, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the"
9,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, to this day."
9,5,6,"But the hand of the"
9,5,7,"When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us; for his hand is severe on us, and on Dagon our god."
9,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?They answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried over to Gath. They carried the ark of the God of Israel there."
9,5,9,"It was so, that after they had carried it about, the hand of the"
9,5,10,"So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.It happened, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people."
9,5,11,"They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people. For there was a deadly confusion throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there."
9,5,12,"The men who did not die were struck with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven."
9,6,1,"The ark of the"
9,6,2,"The Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of the"
9,6,3,"They said, If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty; but by all means return him a trespass offering: then you shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you."
9,6,4,"Then they said, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him?They said, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, for the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords."
9,6,5,"Therefore you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land."
9,6,6,"Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had worked wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?"
9,6,7,"Now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart, and two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke; and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;"
9,6,8,"and take the ark of the"
9,6,9,"And watch; if it goes up by the way of its own territory to Beth Shemesh, then he has done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us; it was a chance that happened to us."
9,6,10,"The men did so, and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home;"
9,6,11,"and they put the ark of the"
9,6,12,"The cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the territory of Beth Shemesh."
9,6,13,"They of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it."
9,6,14,"The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the cows for a burnt offering to the"
9,6,15,"The Levites took down the ark of the"
9,6,16,"When the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day."
9,6,17,"These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to the"
9,6,18,"and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even to the great stone, whereon they set down the ark of the"

9,6,20,"The men of Beth Shemesh said, Who is able to stand before the"
9,6,21,"They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of the"
9,7,1,"The men of Kiriath Jearim came, and fetched up the ark of the"
9,7,2,"It happened, from the day that the ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the"
9,7,3,"Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you do return to the"

9,7,6,"They gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before the"
9,7,7,"When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines."
9,7,8,"The children of Israel said to Samuel, Do not cease to cry to the"
9,7,9,"Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering to the"
9,7,10,"As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but the"
9,7,11,"The men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and struck them, until they came under Beth Kar."
9,7,12,"Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer, saying, The"
9,7,13,"So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the territory of Israel. The hand of the"
9,7,14,"The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel recovered its territory out of the hand of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites."
9,7,15,"Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life."
9,7,16,"He went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places."
9,7,17,"His return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel: and he built there an altar to the"
9,8,1,"It happened, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel."
9,8,2,"Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beersheba."
9,8,3,"His sons did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice."
9,8,4,"Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel to Ramah;"
9,8,5,"and they said to him, Behold, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations."
9,8,6,"But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us.Samuel prayed to the"
9,8,7,"The"
9,8,8,"According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also to you."
9,8,9,"Now therefore listen to their voice: however you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the way of the king who shall reign over them."
9,8,10,"Samuel told all the words of the"
9,8,11,"He said, This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them to him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots;"
9,8,12,"and he will appoint them to him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and he will assign some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots."
9,8,13,"He will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers."
9,8,14,"He will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves, even their best, and give them to his servants."
9,8,15,"He will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants."
9,8,16,"He will take your male servants, and your female servants, and your best young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his work."
9,8,17,"He will take the tenth of your flocks: and you shall be his servants."
9,8,18,"You shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you shall have chosen you; and the"
9,8,19,"But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, No; but we will have a king over us,"
9,8,20,"that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles."
9,8,21,"Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the"
9,8,22,"The"
9,9,1,"Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor."
9,9,2,"He had a son, whose name was Saul, an impressive young man; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he. From his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people."
9,9,3,"The donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys."
9,9,4,"He passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they weren't there: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them."
9,9,5,"When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father stop caring about the donkeys, and be anxious for us."
9,9,6,"He said to him, See now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man who is held in honor. All that he says surely comes to pass. Now let us go there. Perhaps he can tell us concerning our journey on which we have set out."
9,9,7,"Then Saul said to his servant, But behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is gone in our vessels, and there is no gift to bring to the man of God. What do we have?"
9,9,8,"The servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way."
9,9,9,"(In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.)"
9,9,10,"Then Saul said to his servant, Well said. Come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was."
9,9,11,"As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?"
9,9,12,"They answered them, and said, He is. Behold, he is ahead of you. Hurry now, for he has come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place."
9,9,13,"As soon as you have come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes, because he blesses the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited eat. Now therefore go up; for at this time you shall find him."
9,9,14,"They went up to the city. As they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place."
9,9,15,"Now the"
9,9,16,"Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry has come to me."
9,9,17,"When Samuel saw Saul, the"
9,9,18,"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Please tell me where the seer's house is."
9,9,19,"Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am he. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart."
9,9,20,"As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them; for they have been found. And for whom does all Israel desire? Is it not for you, and for all your father's house?"
9,9,21,"Saul answered, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak to me like this?"
9,9,22,"Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons."
9,9,23,"And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I told you to set aside."
9,9,24,"The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. And he said, Behold, that which has been reserved! Set it before yourself and eat; because for the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, 'I have invited the people.' So Saul ate with Samuel that day."
9,9,25,"When they had come down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the housetop."
9,9,26,"They arose early: and it happened about daybreak, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Get up, that I may send you away. Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, went outside."
9,9,27,"As they were going down at the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Tell the servant to go on ahead, (and he passed on), but remain here awhile, that I may make known to you the word of God."
9,10,1,"Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Isn't it that the"
9,10,2,"When you have departed from me today, then you shall find two men by Rachel's tomb, in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will tell you, 'The donkeys which you went to seek have been found; and behold, your father has stopped caring about the donkeys, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?'"
9,10,3,"Then you shall go on forward from there, and you shall come to the oak of Tabor; and three men shall meet you there going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three young goats, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:"
9,10,4,"and they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive of their hand."
9,10,5,"After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall happen, when you have come there to the city, that you shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:"
9,10,6,"and the Spirit of the"
9,10,7,"Let it be, when these signs have come to you, that you do as occasion shall serve you; for God is with you."
9,10,8,"You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: you shall wait seven days, until I come to you, and show you what you shall do."
9,10,9,"It was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs happened that day."
9,10,10,"When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them."
9,10,11,"It happened, when all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that has come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
9,10,12,"One of the same place answered, Who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?"
9,10,13,"When he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place."
9,10,14,"Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Where did you go?He said, To seek the donkeys. When we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel."
9,10,15,"Saul's uncle said, Please tell me what Samuel said to you."
9,10,16,"Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he did not tell him."
9,10,17,"Samuel called the people together to the"
9,10,18,"and he said to the children of Israel, Thus says the"
9,10,19,"but you have this day rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, 'No! Set a king over us.' Now therefore present yourselves before the"
9,10,20,"So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken."
9,10,21,"He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found."
9,10,22,"Therefore they asked of the"
9,10,23,"They ran and fetched him there; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward."
9,10,24,"Samuel said to all the people, You see him whom the"
9,10,25,"Then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the"
9,10,26,"Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the army, whose hearts God had touched."
9,10,27,"But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us? They despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.[Nahash, king of the Ammonites, was oppressing the Gadites and the Reubenites. He put out the right eye of all of them, bringing on Israel fear and trembling. Not one was left of the Israelites beyond the Jordan whose right eye Nahash, king of the Ammonites, did not put out, except for seven thousand men who had escaped from the Ammonites and went to Jabesh Gilead.]"
9,11,1,"After about a month, Nahash the Ammonite came up and encamped against Jabesh Gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you."
9,11,2,"Nahash the Ammonite said to them, On this condition I will make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach on all Israel."
9,11,3,"The elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven day, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel; and then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out to you."
9,11,4,"Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept."
9,11,5,"Behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, What ails the people that they weep? They told him the words of the men of Jabesh."
9,11,6,"The Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly."
9,11,7,"He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoever doesn't come forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. The dread of the"
9,11,8,"He numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand."
9,11,9,"They said to the messengers who came, Thus you shall tell the men of Jabesh Gilead, 'Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.' The messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad."
9,11,10,"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all that seems good to you."
9,11,11,"It was so on the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it happened, that those who remained were scattered, so that no two of them were left together."
9,11,12,"The people said to Samuel, Who is he who said, 'Shall Saul reign over us?' Bring those men, that we may put them to death!"
9,11,13,"Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day; for today the"
9,11,14,"Then Samuel said to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there."
9,11,15,"All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the"
9,12,1,"Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you."
9,12,2,"Now, behold, the king walks before you; and I am old and gray-headed; and behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth to this day."
9,12,3,"Here I am. Witness against me before the"
9,12,4,"They said, You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken anything of any man's hand."
9,12,5,"He said to them, The"
9,12,6,"Samuel said to the people, It is the"
9,12,7,"Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before the"
9,12,8,"When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to the"
9,12,9,"But they forgot the"
9,12,10,"They cried to the"
9,12,11,"The"
9,12,12,"When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, 'No, but a king shall reign over us;' when the"
9,12,13,"Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have asked for: and behold, the"
9,12,14,"If you will fear the"
9,12,15,"But if you will not listen to the voice of the"
9,12,16,"Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which the"
9,12,17,"Isn't it wheat harvest today? I will call to the"
9,12,18,"So Samuel called to the"
9,12,19,"All the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to the"
9,12,20,"Samuel said to the people, Do not be afraid. You have indeed done all this evil; yet do not turn aside from following the"
9,12,21,"Do not turn aside to go after vain things which can't profit nor deliver, for they are vain."
9,12,22,"For the"
9,12,23,"Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the"
9,12,24,"Only fear the"
9,12,25,"But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your king."
9,13,1,"Saul reigned a year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,"
9,13,2,"Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel, of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the Mount of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent."
9,13,3,"Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard of it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear!"
9,13,4,"All Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. The people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal."
9,13,5,"The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven."
9,13,6,"When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits."
9,13,7,"Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling."
9,13,8,"He stayed seven days, according to the time set by Samuel: but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him."
9,13,9,"Saul said, Bring here the burnt offering to me, and the peace offerings. He offered the burnt offering."
9,13,10,"It came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him."
9,13,11,"Samuel said, What have you done?Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;"
9,13,12,"therefore I said, 'Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal, and I haven't entreated the favor of the"
9,13,13,"Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of the"
9,13,14,"But now your kingdom shall not continue. The"
9,13,15,"Samuel arose, and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men."
9,13,16,"Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash."
9,13,17,"The spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;"
9,13,18,"and another company turned the way to Beth Horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness."
9,13,19,"Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears;"
9,13,20,"but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his plowshare, mattock, axe, and sickle;"
9,13,21,"yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the plowshares, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads."
9,13,22,"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found."
9,13,23,"The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash."
9,14,1,"Now it fell on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he did not tell his father."
9,14,2,"Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people who were with him were about six hundred men;"
9,14,3,"and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the"
9,14,4,"Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh."
9,14,5,"The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba."
9,14,6,"Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that the"
9,14,7,"His armor bearer said to him, Do all that is in your heart. Turn and, behold, I am with you according to your heart."
9,14,8,"Then Jonathan said, Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will reveal ourselves to them."
9,14,9,"If they say thus to us, 'Wait until we come to you!' then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them."
9,14,10,"But if they say this, 'Come up to us!' then we will go up; for the"
9,14,11,"Both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves!"
9,14,12,"The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you something!Jonathan said to his armor bearer, Come up after me; for the"
9,14,13,"Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer killed them after him."
9,14,14,"That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land."
9,14,15,"There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling."
9,14,16,"The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and scattered."
9,14,17,"Then Saul said to the people who were with him, Count now, and see who is missing from us. When they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there."
9,14,18,"Saul said to Ahijah, Bring the ark of God here. For the ark of God was with the children of Israel at that time."
9,14,19,"It happened, while Saul talked to the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hand!"
9,14,20,"Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow: a very great confusion."
9,14,21,"Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before, and who went up with them into the camp, from all around, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan."
9,14,22,"Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed closely after them in the battle."
9,14,23,"So the"
9,14,24,"The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening, and I am avenged of my enemies. So none of the people tasted food."
9,14,25,"All the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground."
9,14,26,"When the people had come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath."
9,14,27,"But Jonathan did not hear when his father commanded the people with the oath: therefore he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened."
9,14,28,"Then one of the people answered, and said, Your father directly commanded the people with an oath, saying, 'Cursed is the man who eats food this day.' The people were faint."
9,14,29,"Then Jonathan said, My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey."
9,14,30,"How much more, if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? For now has there been no great slaughter among the Philistines."
9,14,31,"They struck of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were very faint;"
9,14,32,"and the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and cattle, and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood."
9,14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people are sinning against the"
9,14,34,"Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them, 'Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and do not sin against the"
9,14,35,"Saul built an altar to the"
9,14,36,"Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.They said, Do whatever seems good to you.Then the priest said, Let us draw near here to God."
9,14,37,"Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he did not answer him that day."
9,14,38,"Saul said, Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people; and know and see in which this sin has been this day."
9,14,39,"For, as the"
9,14,40,"Then he said to all Israel, You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.The people said to Saul, Do what seems good to you."
9,14,41,"Therefore Saul said to the"
9,14,42,"Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.Jonathan was selected."
9,14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done!Jonathan told him, and said, I certainly did taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die."
9,14,44,"Saul said, God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan."
9,14,45,"The people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As the"
9,14,46,"Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place."
9,14,47,"Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he defeated them."
9,14,48,"He did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them."
9,14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:"
9,14,50,"and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle."
9,14,51,"Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel."
9,14,52,"There was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him to him."
9,15,1,"Samuel said to Saul, The"
9,15,2,"Thus says the"
9,15,3,"Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'"
9,15,4,"Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah."
9,15,5,"Saul came to the city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley."
9,15,6,"Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites."
9,15,7,"Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt."
9,15,8,"He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword."
9,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and wouldn't utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly."
9,15,10,"Then the word of the"
9,15,11,"It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. Samuel was angry; and he cried to the"
9,15,12,"Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal."
9,15,13,"Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, You are blessed by the"
9,15,14,"Samuel said, Then what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean?"
9,15,15,"Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle, to sacrifice to the"
9,15,16,"Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what the"
9,15,17,"Samuel said, Though you were little in your own sight, weren't you made the head of the tribes of Israel? The"
9,15,18,"and the"
9,15,19,"Why then did you not obey the voice of the"
9,15,20,"Saul said to Samuel, But I have obeyed the voice of the"
9,15,21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and cattle, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to the"
9,15,22,"Samuel said, Has the"
9,15,23,"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected the word of the"
9,15,24,"Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the"
9,15,25,"Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the"
9,15,26,"Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the"
9,15,27,"As Samuel turned about to go away, Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore."
9,15,28,"Samuel said to him, The"
9,15,29,"Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent."
9,15,30,"Then he said, I have sinned: yet please honor me now before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and come back with me, that I may worship the"
9,15,31,"So Samuel went back with Saul; and Saul worshiped the"
9,15,32,"Then Samuel said, Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites!Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past."
9,15,33,"Samuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women! Samuel cut Agag in pieces before the"
9,15,34,"Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul."
9,15,35,"Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and the"
9,16,1,"The"
9,16,2,"Samuel said, How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.The"
9,16,3,"Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you."
9,16,4,"Samuel did that which the"
9,16,5,"He said, Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the"
9,16,6,"It happened, when they had come, that he looked at Eliab, and said, Surely the"
9,16,7,"But the"
9,16,8,"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, Neither has the"
9,16,9,"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, Neither has the"
9,16,10,"Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, The"
9,16,11,"Samuel said to Jesse, Are all your children here?He said, There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is keeping the sheep.Samuel said to Jesse, Send and get him; for we will not sit down until he comes here."
9,16,12,"He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful face, and goodly to look on. The"
9,16,13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers: and the Spirit of the"
9,16,14,"Now the Spirit of the"
9,16,15,"Saul's servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you."
9,16,16,"Let our lord now command your servants who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. It shall happen, when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well."
9,16,17,"Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me."
9,16,18,"Then one of the young men answered, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a comely person; and the"
9,16,19,"Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me David your son, who is with the sheep."
9,16,20,"Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul."
9,16,21,"David came to Saul, and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer."
9,16,22,"Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Please let David stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight."
9,16,23,"It happened, when the spirit from God was on Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."
9,17,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim."
9,17,2,"Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines."
9,17,3,"The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them."
9,17,4,"There went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span."
9,17,5,"He had a helmet of brass on his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass."
9,17,6,"He had brass shin armor on his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders."
9,17,7,"The staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and his shield bearer went before him."
9,17,8,"He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why have you come out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me."
9,17,9,"If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then you will be our servants, and serve us."
9,17,10,"The Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day! Give me a man, that we may fight together!"
9,17,11,"When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid."
9,17,12,"Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken among men."
9,17,13,"The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah."
9,17,14,"David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul."
9,17,15,"Now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem."
9,17,16,"The Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days."
9,17,17,"Jesse said to David his son, Now take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers;"
9,17,18,"and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and see how your brothers are doing, and bring back news."
9,17,19,"Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines."
9,17,20,"David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the army which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle."
9,17,21,"Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army."
9,17,22,"David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers."
9,17,23,"As he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them."
9,17,24,"All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were terrified."
9,17,25,"The men of Israel said, Have you seen this man who has come up? He has surely come up to defy Israel. It shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house exempt in Israel."
9,17,26,"David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
9,17,27,"The people answered him in this way, saying, So shall it be done to the man who kills him."
9,17,28,"Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you have come down that you might see the battle."
9,17,29,"David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?"
9,17,30,"He turned away from him toward another, and spoke like that again; and the people answered him again the same way."
9,17,31,"When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him."
9,17,32,"David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine."
9,17,33,"Saul said to David, You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth."
9,17,34,"David said to Saul, Your servant was keeping his father's sheep; and when a lion or a bear came, and took a lamb out of the flock,"
9,17,35,"I went out after him, and struck him, and rescued it out of his mouth. When he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and struck him, and killed him."
9,17,36,"Your servant struck both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God."
9,17,37,"David said, The"
9,17,38,"Saul dressed David with his clothing. He put a helmet of brass on his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail."
9,17,39,"David strapped his sword on his clothing, and he tried to move; for he had not tested it. David said to Saul, I can't go with these; for I have not tested them. David took them off."
9,17,40,"He took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in his wallet. His sling was in his hand; and he drew near to the Philistine."
9,17,41,"The Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him."
9,17,42,"When the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair face."
9,17,43,"The Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks? The Philistine cursed David by his gods."
9,17,44,"The Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the field."
9,17,45,"Then David said to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to you in the name of the"
9,17,46,"Today, the"
9,17,47,"and that all this assembly may know that the"
9,17,48,"It happened, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, that David hurried, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine."
9,17,49,"David put his hand in his bag, took a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth."
9,17,50,"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him; but there was no sword in the hand of David."
9,17,51,"Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and killed him, and cut off his head therewith. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled."
9,17,52,"The men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron."
9,17,53,"The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp."
9,17,54,"David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent."
9,17,55,"When Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this youth?Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I can't tell."
9,17,56,"The king said, Inquire whose son the young man is!"
9,17,57,"As David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand."
9,17,58,"Saul said to him, Whose son are you, you young man?David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite."
9,18,1,"It happened, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul."
9,18,2,"Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house."
9,18,3,"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul."
9,18,4,"Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him, and gave it to David, and his clothing, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his sash."
9,18,5,"David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants."
9,18,6,"It happened as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music."
9,18,7,"The women sang one to another as they played, and said,Saul has slain his thousands,David his ten thousands."
9,18,8,"Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands. What can he have more but the kingdom?"
9,18,9,"Saul eyed David from that day and forward."
9,18,10,"It happened on the next day, that an evil spirit from God came mightily on Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house. David played with his hand, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand;"
9,18,11,"and Saul threw the spear; for he said, I will pin David even to the wall! David escaped from his presence twice."
9,18,12,"Saul was afraid of David, because the"
9,18,13,"Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people."
9,18,14,"David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the"
9,18,15,"When Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him."
9,18,16,"But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them."
9,18,17,"Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, I will give her to you as wife. Only be valiant for me, and fight the"
9,18,18,"David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?"
9,18,19,"But it happened at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife."
9,18,20,"Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him."
9,18,21,"Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David, You shall this day be my son-in-law a second time."
9,18,22,"Saul commanded his servants, Talk with David secretly, and say, 'Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you: now therefore be the king's son-in-law.'"
9,18,23,"Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. David said, Does it seems to you a light thing to be the king's son-in-law, since I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?"
9,18,24,"The servants of Saul told him, saying, David spoke like this."
9,18,25,"Saul said, You shall tell David, 'The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies.' Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines."
9,18,26,"When his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. The days were not expired;"
9,18,27,"and David arose and went, he and his men, and killed of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife."
9,18,28,"Saul saw and knew that the"
9,18,29,"Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David's enemy continually."
9,18,30,"Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it happened, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was highly esteemed."
9,19,1,"Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David."
9,19,2,"Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill you. Now therefore, please take care of yourself in the morning, and live in a secret place, and hide yourself."
9,19,3,"I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will talk with my father about you; and if I see anything, I will tell you."
9,19,4,"Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Do not let the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good toward you;"
9,19,5,"for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine, and the"
9,19,6,"Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, As the"
9,19,7,"Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as before."
9,19,8,"There was war again. David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him."
9,19,9,"An evil spirit from the"
9,19,10,"Saul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he stuck the spear into the wall. David fled, and escaped that night."
9,19,11,"Saul sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to kill him in the morning. Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed."
9,19,12,"So Michal let David down through the window. He went, fled, and escaped."
9,19,13,"Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair at its head, and covered it with the clothes."
9,19,14,"When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick."
9,19,15,"Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him."
9,19,16,"When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' hair at its head."
9,19,17,"Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he is escaped?Michal answered Saul, He said to me, 'Let me go! Why should I kill you?'"
9,19,18,"Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. He and Samuel went and lived in Naioth."
9,19,19,"It was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,20,"Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied."
9,19,21,"When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied."
9,19,22,"Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked, Where are Samuel and David?One said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,23,"He went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then the Spirit of God came on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,24,"He also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?"
9,20,1,"David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? What is my iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?"
9,20,2,"He said to him, Far from it; you shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it to me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so."
9,20,3,"David swore moreover, and said, Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes; and he says, 'Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved:' but truly as the"
9,20,4,"Then Jonathan said to David, Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you."
9,20,5,"David said to Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to dine with the king; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening."
9,20,6,"If your father miss me at all, then say, 'David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.'"
9,20,7,"If he says, 'It is well;' your servant shall have peace: but if he be angry, then know that evil is determined by him."
9,20,8,"Therefore deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the"
9,20,9,"Jonathan said, Far be it from you; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come on you, then wouldn't I tell you that?"
9,20,10,"Then David said to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance your father answers you roughly?"
9,20,11,"Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. They both went out into the field."
9,20,12,"Jonathan said to David, By the"
9,20,13,"The"
9,20,14,"You shall not only while yet I live show me the loving kindness of the"
9,20,15,"but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever; no, not when the"
9,20,16,"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, The"
9,20,17,"Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul."
9,20,18,"Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon: and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty."
9,20,19,"When you have stayed three days, you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you hid yourself when this started, and shall remain by the stone Ezel."
9,20,20,"I will shoot three arrows on its side, as though I shot at a mark."
9,20,21,"Behold, I will send the boy, saying, 'Go, find the arrows!' If I tell the boy, 'Behold, the arrows are on this side of you. Take them;' then come; for there is peace to you and no hurt, as the"
9,20,22,"But if I say this to the boy, 'Behold, the arrows are beyond you;' then go your way; for the"
9,20,23,"Concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, the"
9,20,24,"So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon had come, the king sat him down to eat food."
9,20,25,"The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side: but David's place was empty."
9,20,26,"Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day: for he thought, Something has happened to him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean."
9,20,27,"It happened on the next day after the new moon, the second day, that David's place was empty. Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why doesn't the son of Jesse come to eat, neither yesterday, nor today?"
9,20,28,"Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem."
9,20,29,"He said, 'Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city. My brother has commanded me to be there. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go away and see my brothers.' Therefore he has not come to the king's table."
9,20,30,"Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of a perverse rebellious woman, do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?"
9,20,31,"For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die!"
9,20,32,"Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"
9,20,33,"Saul cast his spear at him to strike him. By this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death."
9,20,34,"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame."
9,20,35,"It happened in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him."
9,20,36,"He said to his boy, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him."
9,20,37,"When the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, Isn't the arrow beyond you?"
9,20,38,"Jonathan cried after the boy, Go fast! Hurry! Do not delay! Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master."
9,20,39,"But the boy did not know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter."
9,20,40,"Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city."
9,20,41,"As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. They kissed one another, and wept one with another, and David wept the most."
9,20,42,"Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, because we have both sworn in the name of the"
9,21,1,"Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?"
9,21,2,"David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, 'Let no man know anything of the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you; and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.'"
9,21,3,"Now therefore what is under your hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present."
9,21,4,"The priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women."
9,21,5,"David answered the priest, and said to him, Truly, women have been kept from us about these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?"
9,21,6,"So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before the"
9,21,7,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the"
9,21,8,"David said to Ahimelech, Isn't there here under your hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste."
9,21,9,"The priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it; for there is no other except that here.David said, There is none like that. Give it to me."
9,21,10,"David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath."
9,21,11,"The servants of Achish said to him, Isn't this David the king of the land? Did they not sing one to another about him in dances, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?'"
9,21,12,"David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath."
9,21,13,"He changed his behavior before them, and pretended to be mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard."
9,21,14,"Then Achish said to his servants, Look, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?"
9,21,15,"Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?"
9,22,1,"David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him."
9,22,2,"Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented, gathered themselves to him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men."
9,22,3,"David went there to Mizpeh of Moab, and he said to the king of Moab, Please let my father and my mother come out with you, until I know what God will do for me."
9,22,4,"He brought them before the king of Moab; and they lived with him all the while that David was in the stronghold."
9,22,5,"The prophet Gad said to David, Do not stay in the stronghold. Depart, and go into the land of Judah.Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth."
9,22,6,"Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him."
9,22,7,"Saul said to his servants who stood about him, Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,"
9,22,8,"that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none who discloses to me when my son makes a treaty with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me, or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
9,22,9,"Then Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, answered and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub."
9,22,10,"He inquired of the"
9,22,11,"Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests who were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king."
9,22,12,"Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub.He answered, Here I am, my lord."
9,22,13,"Saul said to him, Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
9,22,14,"Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, Who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and is taken into your council, and is honorable in your house?"
9,22,15,"Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? Be it far from me! Do not let the king impute anything to his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for your servant knows nothing of all this, less or more."
9,22,16,"The king said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father's house."
9,22,17,"The king said to the guard who stood about him, Turn, and kill the priests of the"
9,22,18,"The king said to Doeg, Turn and attack the priests!Doeg the Edomite turned, and he attacked the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five people who wore a linen ephod."
9,22,19,"He struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing babies, and cattle and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword."
9,22,20,"One of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David."
9,22,21,"Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the"
9,22,22,"David said to Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of all the persons of your father's house."
9,22,23,"Stay with me, do not be afraid; for he who seeks my life seeks your life. For with me you shall be in safeguard."
9,23,1,"David was told, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing floors."
9,23,2,"Therefore David inquired of the"
9,23,3,"David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?"
9,23,4,"Then David inquired of the"
9,23,5,"David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah."
9,23,6,"It happened, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand."
9,23,7,"It was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. Saul said, God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and bars."
9,23,8,"Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men."
9,23,9,"David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring the ephod here."
9,23,10,"Then David said, O"
9,23,11,"Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard?"
9,23,12,"Then David said, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?The"
9,23,13,"Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. It was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he gave up going there."
9,23,14,"David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand."
9,23,15,"David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood."
9,23,16,"Jonathan, Saul's son, arose, and went to David into the woods, and strengthened his hand in God."
9,23,17,"He said to him, Do not be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father knows."
9,23,18,"They both made a covenant before the"
9,23,19,"Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doesn't David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?"
9,23,20,"Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king's hand."
9,23,21,"Saul said, You are blessed by the"
9,23,22,"Please go make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there; for it is told me that he deals very subtly."
9,23,23,"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come again to me with certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall happen, if he is in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah."
9,23,24,"They arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert."
9,23,25,"Saul and his men went to seek him. When David was told, he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard that, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon."
9,23,26,"Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them."
9,23,27,"But a messenger came to Saul, saying, Hurry and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land!"
9,23,28,"So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth."
9,23,29,"David went up from there, and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi."
9,24,1,"It happened, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi."
9,24,2,"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats."
9,24,3,"He came to the sheep pens by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave."
9,24,4,"The men of David said to him, Behold, the day of which the"
9,24,5,"It happened afterward, that David's heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt."
9,24,6,"He said to his men, The"
9,24,7,"So David checked his men with these words, and did not allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way."
9,24,8,"David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king!When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and showed respect."
9,24,9,"David said to Saul, Why do you listen to men's words, saying, 'Behold, David seeks your hurt?'"
9,24,10,"Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that the"
9,24,11,"Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and did not kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt for my life to take it."
9,24,12,"May the"
9,24,13,"As the proverb of the ancients says, 'Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness;' but my hand shall not be on you."
9,24,14,"Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea?"
9,24,15,"May the"
9,24,16,"It came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David? Saul lifted up his voice, and wept."
9,24,17,"He said to David, You are more righteous than I; for you have done good to me, whereas I have done evil to you."
9,24,18,"You have declared this day how you have dealt well with me, because when the"
9,24,19,"For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may the"
9,24,20,"Now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand."
9,24,21,"Swear now therefore to me by the"
9,24,22,"David swore to Saul. Saul went home; but David and his men went up to the stronghold."
9,25,1,"Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran."
9,25,2,"There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel."
9,25,3,"Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful face: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb."
9,25,4,"David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep."
9,25,5,"David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name."
9,25,6,"You shall tell him, 'Long life to you! Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have."
9,25,7,"Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds have now been with us, and we did not hurt them, neither was there anything missing from them, all the while they were in Carmel."
9,25,8,"Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come in a good day. Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your son David.'"
9,25,9,"When David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased."
9,25,10,"Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants who break away from their masters these days."
9,25,11,"Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I do not know where they come from?"
9,25,12,"So David's young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words."
9,25,13,"David said to his men, Every man put on his sword!Every man put on his sword. David also put on his sword. About four hundred men followed David; and two hundred stayed by the baggage."
9,25,14,"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to Greet our master; and he railed at them."
9,25,15,"But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields."
9,25,16,"They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep."
9,25,17,"Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house; for he is such a worthless fellow that one can't speak to him."
9,25,18,"Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two bottles of wine, five sheep ready dressed, five measures of parched grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys."
9,25,19,"She said to her young men, Go on before me. Behold, I come after you. But she did not tell her husband, Nabal."
9,25,20,"It was so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them."
9,25,21,"Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him. He has returned me evil for good."
9,25,22,"God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall."
9,25,23,"When Abigail saw David, she hurried, and got off from her donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground."
9,25,24,"She fell at his feet, and said, On me, my lord, on me be the iniquity; and please let your handmaid speak in your ears. Hear the words of your handmaid."
9,25,25,"Please do not let my lord regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your handmaid, did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent."
9,25,26,"Now therefore, my lord, as the"
9,25,27,"Now this present which your servant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord."
9,25,28,"Please forgive the trespass of your handmaid. For the"
9,25,29,"Though men may rise up to pursue you, and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the"
9,25,30,"It shall come to pass, when the"
9,25,31,"that this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. When the"
9,25,32,"David said to Abigail, Blessed is the"
9,25,33,"Blessed is your discretion, and blessed are you, that have kept me this day from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand."
9,25,34,"For indeed, as the"
9,25,35,"So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said to her, Go up in peace to your house. Behold, I have listened to your voice, and have granted your request."
9,25,36,"Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken. Therefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light."
9,25,37,"It happened in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone."
9,25,38,"It happened about ten days after, that the"
9,25,39,"When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed is the"
9,25,40,"When the servants of David had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to you, to take you to him as wife."
9,25,41,"She arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord."
9,25,42,"Abigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five ladies of hers who followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife."
9,25,43,"David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they both became his wives."
9,25,44,"Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim."
9,26,1,"The Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doesn't David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?"
9,26,2,"Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph."
9,26,3,"Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness."
9,26,4,"David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had certainly come."
9,26,5,"David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army: and Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around him."
9,26,6,"Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?Abishai said, I will go down with you."
9,26,7,"So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay around him."
9,26,8,"Then Abishai said to David, God has delivered up your enemy into your hand this day. Now therefore please let me strike him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time."
9,26,9,"David said to Abishai, Do not destroy him; for who can put forth his hand against the"
9,26,10,"David said, As the"
9,26,11,"The"
9,26,12,"So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head; and they went away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the"
9,26,13,"Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;"
9,26,14,"and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Do you not answer, Abner?Then Abner answered, Who are you who cries to the king?"
9,26,15,"David said to Abner, Aren't you a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord, the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord."
9,26,16,"This thing isn't good that you have done. As the"
9,26,17,"Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this your voice, my son David?David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king."
9,26,18,"He said, Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?"
9,26,19,"Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is so that the"
9,26,20,"Now therefore, do not let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the"
9,26,21,"Then Saul said, I have sinned. Return, my son David; for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly."
9,26,22,"David answered, Behold the spear, O king! Then let one of the young men come over and get it."
9,26,23,"The"
9,26,24,"Behold, as your life was respected this day in my eyes, so let my life be respected in the eyes of the"
9,26,25,"Then Saul said to David, You are blessed, my son David. You shall both do mightily, and shall surely prevail. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place."
9,27,1,"David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel. So shall I escape out of his hand."
9,27,2,"David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath."
9,27,3,"David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife."
9,27,4,"It was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him."
9,27,5,"David said to Achish, If now I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?"
9,27,6,"Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: why Ziklag pertains to the kings of Judah to this day."
9,27,7,"The number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months."
9,27,8,"David and his men went up, and made a raid on the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt."
9,27,9,"David struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the cattle, and the donkeys, and the camels, and the clothing; and he returned, and came to Achish."
9,27,10,"Achish said, Against whom have you made a raid today?David said, Against the Negev of Judah, against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites, and against the Negev of the Kenites."
9,27,11,"David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, 'David has done this, and this has been his way all the time he has lived in the country of the Philistines.'"
9,27,12,"Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him. Therefore he shall be my servant forever."
9,28,1,"It happened in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. Achish said to David, Know assuredly that you shall go out with me in the army, you and your men."
9,28,2,"David said to Achish, Therefore you shall know what your servant will do.Achish said to David, Therefore will I make you my bodyguard for ever."
9,28,3,"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land."
9,28,4,"The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa."
9,28,5,"When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly."
9,28,6,"When Saul inquired of the"
9,28,7,"Then Saul said to his servants, Seek me a woman who has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her.His servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has a familiar spirit at Endor."
9,28,8,"Saul disguised himself, and put on other clothing, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Please divine to me by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomever I shall name to you."
9,28,9,"The woman said to him, Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?"
9,28,10,"Saul swore to her by the"
9,28,11,"Then the woman said, Whom shall I bring up to you?He said, Bring Samuel up for me."
9,28,12,"When the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!"
9,28,13,"The king said to her, Do not be afraid. For what do you see?The woman said to Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth."
9,28,14,"He said to her, What does he look like?She said, An old man comes up. He is covered with a robe. Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and showed respect."
9,28,15,"Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up?Saul answered, I am very distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do."
9,28,16,"Samuel said, Why then do you ask of me, since the"
9,28,17,"The"
9,28,18,"Because you did not obey the voice of the"
9,28,19,"Moreover the"
9,28,20,"Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth, and was terrified, because of the words of Samuel. There was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night."
9,28,21,"The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was very troubled, and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me."
9,28,22,"Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way."
9,28,23,"But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat on the bed."
9,28,24,"The woman had a fattened calf in the house. She hurried and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it."
9,28,25,"She brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night."
9,29,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is in Jezreel."
9,29,2,"The lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish."
9,29,3,"Then the princes of the Philistines said, What about these Hebrews?Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, Isn't this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or rather these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away to this day?"
9,29,4,"But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For with what should this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Should it not be with the heads of these men?"
9,29,5,"Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?'"
9,29,6,"Then Achish called David, and said to him, As the"
9,29,7,"Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you not displease the lords of the Philistines."
9,29,8,"David said to Achish, But what have I done? What have you found in your servant so long as I have been before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
9,29,9,"Achish answered David, I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God. Notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, 'He shall not go up with us to the battle.'"
9,29,10,"Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you; and as soon as you are up early in the morning, and have light, depart."
9,29,11,"So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. The Philistines went up to Jezreel."
9,30,1,"It happened, when David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev, and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burned it with fire,"
9,30,2,"and had taken captive the women and all who were therein, both small and great. They did not kill any, but carried them off, and went their way."
9,30,3,"When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive."
9,30,4,"Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep."
9,30,5,"David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite."
9,30,6,"David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in the"
9,30,7,"David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, Please bring me here the ephod.Abiathar brought the ephod to David."
9,30,8,"David inquired of the"
9,30,9,"So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed."
9,30,10,"But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn't go over the brook Besor."
9,30,11,"They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink."
9,30,12,"They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights."
9,30,13,"David asked him, To whom do you belong? Where are you from?He said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick."
9,30,14,"We made a raid on the South of the Kerethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire."
9,30,15,"David said to him, Will you bring me down to this troop?He said, Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop."
9,30,16,"When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread around over all the ground, eating, drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah."
9,30,17,"David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped from there, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled."
9,30,18,"David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives."
9,30,19,"There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them. David brought back all."
9,30,20,"David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other livestock, and said, This is David's spoil."
9,30,21,"David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to stay at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him. When David came near to the people, he greeted them."
9,30,22,"Then all the wicked men and base fellows, of those who went with David, answered and said, Because they did not go with us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart."
9,30,23,"Then David said, You shall not do so, my brothers, with that which the"
9,30,24,"Who will listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage: they shall share alike."
9,30,25,"It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day."
9,30,26,"When David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the"
9,30,27,"He sent it to those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the Negev, and to those who were in Jattir,"
9,30,28,"and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa,"
9,30,29,"and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,"
9,30,30,"and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Borashan, and to those who were in Athach,"
9,30,31,"and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay."
9,31,1,"Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa."
9,31,2,"The Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul."
9,31,3,"The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers."
9,31,4,"Then Saul said to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me! But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it."
9,31,5,"When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died with him."
9,31,6,"So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together."
9,31,7,"When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them."
9,31,8,"It happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa."
9,31,9,"They cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to the house of their idols, and to the people."
9,31,10,"They put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan."
9,31,11,"When the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,"
9,31,12,"all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there."
9,31,13,"They took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days."
10,1,1,"It happened after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag;"
10,1,2,"it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and showed respect."
10,1,3,"David said to him, Where do you come from?He said to him, I have escaped out of the camp of Israel."
10,1,4,"David said to him, How did it go? Please tell me.He answered, The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also."
10,1,5,"David said to the young man who told him, How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?"
10,1,6,"The young man who told him said, As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him."
10,1,7,"When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, 'Here I am.'"
10,1,8,"He said to me, 'Who are you?' I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.'"
10,1,9,"He said to me, 'Please stand beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.'"
10,1,10,"So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord."
10,1,11,"Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him."
10,1,12,"They mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the"
10,1,13,"David said to the young man who told him, Where are you from?He answered, I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite."
10,1,14,"David said to him, How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the"
10,1,15,"David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall on him. He struck him, so that he died."
10,1,16,"David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have slain the"
10,1,17,"David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son"
10,1,18,"(and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):"
10,1,19,"Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places!How the mighty have fallen!"
10,1,20,"Do not tell it in Gath.Do not publish it in the streets of Ashkelon,lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph."
10,1,21,"You mountains of Gilboa,let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings;For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil."
10,1,22,"From the blood of the slain,from the fat of the mighty,Jonathan's bow did not turn back.Saul's sword did not return empty."
10,1,23,"Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives.In their death, they were not divided.They were swifter than eagles.They were stronger than lions."
10,1,24,"You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,who clothed you in scarlet delicately,who put ornaments of gold on your clothing."
10,1,25,"How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!Jonathan is slain on your high places."
10,1,26,"I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan.You have been very pleasant to me.Your love to me was wonderful,passing the love of women."
10,1,27,"How are the mighty fallen,and the weapons of war perished!"
10,2,1,"It happened after this, that David inquired of the"
10,2,2,"So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite."
10,2,3,"David brought up his men who were with him, every man with his household. They lived in the cities of Hebron."
10,2,4,"The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David, saying, The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul."
10,2,5,"David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, Blessed are you by the"
10,2,6,"Now may the"
10,2,7,"Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them."
10,2,8,"Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's army, had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;"
10,2,9,"and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel."
10,2,10,"Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David."
10,2,11,"The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months."
10,2,12,"Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon."
10,2,13,"Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool."
10,2,14,"Abner said to Joab, Please let the young men arise and play before us!Joab said, Let them arise!"
10,2,15,"Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David."
10,2,16,"They each caught his opponent by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim, which is in Gibeon."
10,2,17,"The battle was very severe that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David."
10,2,18,"The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle."
10,2,19,"Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he did not turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner."
10,2,20,"Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it you, Asahel?He answered, It is I."
10,2,21,"Abner said to him, Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and grab one of the young men, and take his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him."
10,2,22,"Abner said again to Asahel, Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?"
10,2,23,"However he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner with the back end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place. It happened, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still."
10,2,24,"But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon."
10,2,25,"The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill."
10,2,26,"Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, before you ask the people to return from following their brothers?"
10,2,27,"Joab said, As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone away, and not each followed his brother."
10,2,28,"So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more."
10,2,29,"Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim."
10,2,30,"Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel."
10,2,31,"But the servants of David had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred sixty men died."
10,2,32,"They took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron."
10,3,1,"Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David grew stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker."
10,3,2,"To David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;"
10,3,3,"and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;"
10,3,4,"and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;"
10,3,5,"and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron."
10,3,6,"It happened, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul."
10,3,7,"Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?"
10,3,8,"Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me this day with a fault concerning this woman!"
10,3,9,"God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as the"
10,3,10,"to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba."
10,3,11,"He could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him."
10,3,12,"Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? and saying, Make your alliance with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring all Israel around to you."
10,3,13,"He said, Good; I will make a treaty with you; but one thing I require of you. That is, you shall not see my face, unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face."
10,3,14,"David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
10,3,15,"Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish."
10,3,16,"Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, Go! Return! and he returned."
10,3,17,"Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past, you sought for David to be king over you."
10,3,18,"Now then do it; for the"
10,3,19,"Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin."
10,3,20,"So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast."
10,3,21,"Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires. David sent Abner away; and he went in peace."
10,3,22,"Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace."
10,3,23,"When Joab and all the army who was with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace."
10,3,24,"Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?"
10,3,25,"You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do."
10,3,26,"When Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David did not know it."
10,3,27,"When Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother."
10,3,28,"Afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the"
10,3,29,"Let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house. Let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread."
10,3,30,"So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle."
10,3,31,"David said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him, Tear your clothes, and clothe yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. King David followed the bier."
10,3,32,"They buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept."
10,3,33,"The king lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dies?"
10,3,34,"Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters. As a man falls before the children of iniquity, so you fell.All the people wept again over him."
10,3,35,"All the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun goes down."
10,3,36,"All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people."
10,3,37,"So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of Ner."
10,3,38,"The king said to his servants, Do you not know that there a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?"
10,3,39,"I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. May the"
10,4,1,"When Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled."
10,4,2,"Saul's son had two men who were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:"
10,4,3,"and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners there until this day)."
10,4,4,"Now Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth."
10,4,5,"The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, as he took his rest at noon."
10,4,6,"They came there into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped."
10,4,7,"Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him, and killed him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night."
10,4,8,"They brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life! The"
10,4,9,"David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As the"
10,4,10,"when someone told me, 'Behold, Saul is dead,' thinking to have brought good news, I took hold of him, and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news."
10,4,11,"How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?"
10,4,12,"David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron."
10,5,1,"Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh."
10,5,2,"In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. The"
10,5,3,"So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the"
10,5,4,"David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years."
10,5,5,"In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah."
10,5,6,"The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, Unless you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here; thinking, David can't come in here."
10,5,7,"Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David."
10,5,8,"David said on that day, Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and strike the lame and the blind, who are hated by David's soul. Therefore they say, The blind and the lame can't come into the house."
10,5,9,"David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. David built around from Millo and inward."
10,5,10,"David grew greater and greater; for the"
10,5,11,"Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house."
10,5,12,"David perceived that the"
10,5,13,"David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David."
10,5,14,"These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,"
10,5,15,"and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,"
10,5,16,"and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet."
10,5,17,"When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold."
10,5,18,"Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim."
10,5,19,"David inquired of the"
10,5,20,"David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said, The"
10,5,21,"They left their images there; and David and his men took them away."
10,5,22,"The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim."
10,5,23,"When David inquired of the"
10,5,24,"It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall stir yourself up; for then the"
10,5,25,"David did so, as the"
10,6,1,"David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand."
10,6,2,"David arose, and went with all the people who were with him, from Baale Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of the"
10,6,3,"They set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart."
10,6,4,"They brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark."
10,6,5,"David and all the house of Israel played before the"
10,6,6,"When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached for the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the cattle stumbled."
10,6,7,"The anger of the"
10,6,8,"David was displeased, because the"
10,6,9,"David was afraid of the"
10,6,10,"So David would not move the ark of the"
10,6,11,"The ark of the"
10,6,12,"It was told king David, saying, The"
10,6,13,"It was so, that, when those who bore the ark of the"
10,6,14,"David danced before the"
10,6,15,"So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the"
10,6,16,"It was so, as the ark of the"
10,6,17,"They brought in the ark of the"
10,6,18,"When David had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the"
10,6,19,"He gave to all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to everyone a portion of bread, dates, and raisins. So all the people departed everyone to his house."
10,6,20,"Then David returned to bless his household. Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious the king of Israel was today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!"
10,6,21,"David said to Michal, It was before the"
10,6,22,"I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in my own sight. But of the handmaids of whom you have spoken, they shall honor me."
10,6,23,"Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death."
10,7,1,"It happened, when the king lived in his house, and the"
10,7,2,"that the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains."
10,7,3,"Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart; for the"
10,7,4,"It happened the same night, that the word of the"
10,7,5,"Go and tell my servant David, 'Thus says the"
10,7,6,"For I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle."
10,7,7,"In all places in which I have walked with all the children of Israel, did I say a word to any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, 'Why have you not built me a house of cedar?''"
10,7,8,"Now therefore you shall tell my servant David this, 'Thus says the"
10,7,9,"I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth."
10,7,10,"I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,"
10,7,11,"and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will cause you to rest from all your enemies. Moreover the"
10,7,12,"When your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom."
10,7,13,"He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever."
10,7,14,"I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;"
10,7,15,"but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you."
10,7,16,"Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever.'"
10,7,17,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David."
10,7,18,"Then David the king went in, and sat before the"
10,7,19,"This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord"
10,7,20,"What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Lord"
10,7,21,"For your word's sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it."
10,7,22,"Therefore you are great,"
10,7,23,"What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make himself a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things for your land, before your people, whom you redeem to yourself out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods?"
10,7,24,"You established for yourself your people Israel to be a people to you forever; and you,"
10,7,25,"Now,"
10,7,26,"Let your name be magnified forever, saying, 'The"
10,7,27,"For you, the"

10,8,1,"After this it happened that David struck the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines."
10,8,2,"He struck Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. The Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute."
10,8,3,"David struck also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River."
10,8,4,"David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one hundred chariots."
10,8,5,"When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men."
10,8,6,"Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. The"
10,8,7,"David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem."
10,8,8,"From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took a very great amount of brass."
10,8,9,"When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer,"
10,8,10,"then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:"
10,8,11,"King David also dedicated these to the"
10,8,12,"of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah."
10,8,13,"David earned a reputation when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men."
10,8,14,"He put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. The"
10,8,15,"David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness to all his people."
10,8,16,"Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;"
10,8,17,"and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;"
10,8,18,"and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief ministers."
10,9,1,"David said, Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?"
10,9,2,"There was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, Are you Ziba?He said, Your servant is he."
10,9,3,"The king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him?Ziba said to the king, Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame of his feet."
10,9,4,"The king said to him, Where is he?Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar."
10,9,5,"Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar."
10,9,6,"Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and showed respect. David said, Mephibosheth.He answered, Behold, your servant!"
10,9,7,"David said to him, Do not be afraid of him; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father's sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father. You shall eat bread at my table continually."
10,9,8,"He bowed down, and said, What is your servant, that you should look on such a dead dog as I am?"
10,9,9,"Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given to your master's son."
10,9,10,"You shall till the land for him, you, and your sons, and your servants; and you shall bring in the harvest, that your master's son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth your master's son shall eat bread always at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants."
10,9,11,"Then Ziba said to the king, According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your shall servant do. So Mephibosheth ate at the king's table, like one of the king's sons."
10,9,12,"Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. All that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth."
10,9,13,"So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually at the king's table. He was lame in both his feet."
10,10,1,"It happened after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place."
10,10,2,"David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon."
10,10,3,"But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Hasn't David sent his servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?"
10,10,4,"So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away."
10,10,5,"When they told it to David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return."
10,10,6,"When the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men."
10,10,7,"When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men."
10,10,8,"The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field."
10,10,9,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:"
10,10,10,"The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon."
10,10,11,"He said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you."
10,10,12,"Be courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God; and the"
10,10,13,"So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him."
10,10,14,"When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem."
10,10,15,"When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together."
10,10,16,"Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head."
10,10,17,"It was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. The Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him."
10,10,18,"The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians seven hundred charioteers, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their army, so that he died there."
10,10,19,"When all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more."
10,11,1,"It happened, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem."
10,11,2,"It happened at evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look on."
10,11,3,"David sent and inquired after the woman. One said, Isn't this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
10,11,4,"David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house."
10,11,5,"The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child."
10,11,6,"David sent to Joab, Send me Uriah the Hittite. Joab sent Uriah to David."
10,11,7,"When Uriah had come to him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered."
10,11,8,"David said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet. Uriah departed out of the king's house, and a gift from the king was sent after him."
10,11,9,"But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house."
10,11,10,"When they had told David, saying, Uriah did not go down to his house, David said to Uriah, Haven't you come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?"
10,11,11,"Uriah said to David, The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!"
10,11,12,"David said to Uriah, Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart. So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day."
10,11,13,"When David had called him, he ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but did not go down to his house."
10,11,14,"It happened in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah."
10,11,15,"He wrote in the letter, saying, Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die."
10,11,16,"It happened, when Joab kept watch on the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were."
10,11,17,"The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also."
10,11,18,"Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;"
10,11,19,"and he commanded the messenger, saying, When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,"
10,11,20,"it shall be that, if the king's wrath arise, and he asks you, 'Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall,"
10,11,21,"who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did a woman not cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' Then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'"
10,11,22,"So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for."
10,11,23,"The messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate."
10,11,24,"The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king's servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
10,11,25,"Then David said to the messenger, Thus you shall tell Joab, 'Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.' Encourage him."
10,11,26,"When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband."
10,11,27,"When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the"
10,12,1,"The"
10,12,2,"The rich man had very many flocks and herds,"
10,12,3,"but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him like a daughter."
10,12,4,"A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man who had come to him."
10,12,5,"David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, As the"
10,12,6,"He shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity!"
10,12,7,"Nathan said to David, You are the man. This is what the"
10,12,8,"I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things."
10,12,9,"Why have you despised the word of the"
10,12,10,"Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.'"
10,12,11,"This is what the"
10,12,12,"For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.'"
10,12,13,"David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the"
10,12,14,"However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the"
10,12,15,"Nathan departed to his house.The"
10,12,16,"David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the ground."
10,12,17,"The elders of his house arose beside him, to raise him up from the ground: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them."
10,12,18,"It happened on the seventh day, that the child died. The servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to our voice. How will he then harm himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?"
10,12,19,"But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, Is the child dead?They said, He is dead."
10,12,20,"Then David arose from the ground, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing; and he came into the house of the"
10,12,21,"Then his servants said to him, What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child was dead, you rose up and ate bread."
10,12,22,"He said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, 'Who knows whether the"
10,12,23,"But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me."
10,12,24,"David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. She bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. The"
10,12,25,"and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he named him Jedidiah, for the"
10,12,26,"Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city."
10,12,27,"Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah. Yes, I have taken the city of waters."
10,12,28,"Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name."
10,12,29,"David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it."
10,12,30,"He took the crown of their king from off his head; and its weight was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David's head. He brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount."
10,12,31,"He brought out the people who were therein, and put them under saws, and under iron picks, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln: and he did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."
10,13,1,"It happened after this, that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her."
10,13,2,"Amnon was so troubled that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her."
10,13,3,"But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man."
10,13,4,"He said to him, Why, son of the king, are you so sad from day to day? Won't you tell me?Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."
10,13,5,"Jonadab said to him, Lie down on your bed, and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, tell him, 'Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.'"
10,13,6,"So Amnon lay down and faked being sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let my sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand."
10,13,7,"Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnon's house, and prepare food for him."
10,13,8,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. She took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes."
10,13,9,"She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, Have all men leave me. Every man went out from him."
10,13,10,"Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand. Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother."
10,13,11,"When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister!"
10,13,12,"She answered him, No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Do not do this folly."
10,13,13,"I, where would I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you."
10,13,14,"However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her."
10,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone!"
10,13,16,"She said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!But he would not listen to her."
10,13,17,"Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her."
10,13,18,"She had a garment of various colors on her; for with such robes were the king's daughters who were virgins dressed. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her."
10,13,19,"Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went."
10,13,20,"Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother. Do not take this thing to heart.So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house."
10,13,21,"But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry."
10,13,22,"Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar."
10,13,23,"It happened after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons."
10,13,24,"Absalom came to the king, and said, See now, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant."
10,13,25,"The king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you. He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him."
10,13,26,"Then Absalom said, If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.The king said to him, Why should he go with you?"
10,13,27,"But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him."
10,13,28,"Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, 'Strike Amnon,' then kill him. Do not be afraid. Haven't I commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant!"
10,13,29,"The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got up on his mule, and fled."
10,13,30,"It happened, while they were in the way, that the news came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left!"
10,13,31,"Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the ground; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn."
10,13,32,"Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered, Do not let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar."
10,13,33,"Now therefore do not let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead."
10,13,34,"But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him."
10,13,35,"Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons are coming! It is as your servant said."
10,13,36,"It happened, as soon as he had finished speaking, that behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. The king also and all his servants wept bitterly."
10,13,37,"But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day."
10,13,38,"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years."
10,13,39,"King David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead."
10,14,1,"Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom."
10,14,2,"Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched there a wise woman, and said to her, Please act like a mourner, and put on mourning clothing, please, and do not anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman who has mourned a long time for the dead."
10,14,3,"Go in to the king, and speak like this to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth."
10,14,4,"When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, showed respect, and said, Help, O king!"
10,14,5,"The king said to her, What ails you?She answered, Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead."
10,14,6,"Your handmaid had two sons, and they both fought together in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed him."
10,14,7,"Behold, the whole family has risen against your handmaid, and they say, 'Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also.' Thus they would quench my coal which is left, and would leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth."
10,14,8,"The king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you."
10,14,9,"The woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house; and the king and his throne be guiltless."
10,14,10,"The king said, Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you any more."
10,14,11,"Then she said, Please let the king remember the"
10,14,12,"Then the woman said, Please let your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king.He said, Say on."
10,14,13,"The woman said, Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home again his banished one."
10,14,14,"For we must die, and are as water split on the ground, which can't be gathered up again; neither does God take away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be an outcast from him."
10,14,15,"Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, 'I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.'"
10,14,16,"For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God."
10,14,17,"Then your handmaid said, 'Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad. May the"
10,14,18,"Then the king answered the woman, Please do not hide anything from me that I ask you.The woman said, Let my lord the king now speak."
10,14,19,"The king said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?The woman answered, As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab, he urged me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid;"
10,14,20,"to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing. My lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth."
10,14,21,"The king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing. Go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back."
10,14,22,"Joab fell to the ground on his face, showed respect, and blessed the king. Joab said, Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant."
10,14,23,"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem."
10,14,24,"The king said, Let him return to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and did not see the king's face."
10,14,25,"Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him."
10,14,26,"When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year's end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king's weight."
10,14,27,"To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a beautiful face."
10,14,28,"Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem; and he did not see the king's face."
10,14,29,"Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come."
10,14,30,"Therefore he said to his servants, Behold, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire. Absalom's servants set the field on fire. [And the servants of Joab came to him with their clothes rent, and they said to him, The servants of Absalom have set the field on fire.]"
10,14,31,"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, Why have your servants set my field on fire?"
10,14,32,"Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, 'Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me.'"
10,14,33,"So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom."
10,15,1,"It happened after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him."
10,15,2,"Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate. It was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, What city are you from?He said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel."
10,15,3,"Absalom said to him, Behold, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputized by the king to hear you."
10,15,4,"Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!"
10,15,5,"It was so, that when any man came near to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him."
10,15,6,"Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel."
10,15,7,"It happened at the end of forty years, that Absalom said to the king, Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the"
10,15,8,"For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, 'If the"
10,15,9,"The king said to him, Go in peace.So he arose, and went to Hebron."
10,15,10,"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, 'Absalom is king in Hebron!'"
10,15,11,"Two hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they did not know anything."
10,15,12,"Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom."
10,15,13,"A messenger came to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom."
10,15,14,"David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom. Make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword."
10,15,15,"The king's servants said to the king, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses."
10,15,16,"The king went forth, and all his household after him. The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house."
10,15,17,"The king went forth, and all the people after him; and they stayed in Beth Merhak."
10,15,18,"All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king."
10,15,19,"Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why do you also go with us? Return, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile. Return to your own place."
10,15,20,"Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us, since I go where I may? Return, and take back your brothers. Mercy and truth be with you."
10,15,21,"Ittai answered the king, and said, As the"
10,15,22,"David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who were with him."
10,15,23,"All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness."
10,15,24,"Behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people finished passing out of the city."
10,15,25,"The king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the"
10,15,26,"but if he say thus, 'I have no delight in you;' behold, here am I. Let him do to me as seems good to him."
10,15,27,"The king said also to Zadok the priest, Aren't you a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar."
10,15,28,"Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me."
10,15,29,"Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem; and they stayed there."
10,15,30,"David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people who were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up."
10,15,31,"Someone told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.David said, "
10,15,32,"It happened that when David had come to the top, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn, and earth on his head."
10,15,33,"David said to him, If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me;"
10,15,34,"but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king. As I have been your father's servant in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.'"
10,15,35,"Do you not have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you? Therefore it shall be, that whatever thing you shall hear out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests."
10,15,36,"Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear."
10,15,37,"So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem."
10,16,1,"When David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a bottle of wine."
10,16,2,"The king said to Ziba, What do you mean by these? Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink."
10,16,3,"The king said, Where is your master's son?Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem; for he said, 'Today the house of Israel will restore me the kingdom of my father.'"
10,16,4,"Then the king said to Ziba, Behold, all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours.Ziba said, I do obeisance. Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king."
10,16,5,"When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of the house of Saul came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out, and cursed still as he came."
10,16,6,"He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left."
10,16,7,"Shimei said when he cursed, Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and base fellow!"
10,16,8,"The"
10,16,9,"Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head."
10,16,10,"The king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because the"
10,16,11,"David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life. How much more this Benjamite, now? Leave him alone, and let him curse; for the"
10,16,12,"It may be that the"
10,16,13,"So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him, and cursed as he went, threw stones at him, and threw dust."
10,16,14,"The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there."
10,16,15,"Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him."
10,16,16,"It happened, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, had come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, Long live the king! Long live the king!"
10,16,17,"Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?"
10,16,18,"Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whomever the"
10,16,19,"Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn't I serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father's presence, so will I be in your presence."
10,16,20,"Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do."
10,16,21,"Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's concubines, that he has left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong."
10,16,22,"So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel."
10,16,23,"The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom."
10,17,1,"Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David tonight."
10,17,2,"I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid. All the people who are with him shall flee. I will strike the king only;"
10,17,3,"and I will bring back all the people to you. The man whom you seek is as if all returned. All the people shall be in peace."
10,17,4,"The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel."
10,17,5,"Then Absalom said, Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says."
10,17,6,"When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken like this. Shall we do what he says? If not, speak up."
10,17,7,"Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good."
10,17,8,"Hushai said moreover, You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people."
10,17,9,"Behold, he is now hidden in some pit, or in some other place. It will happen, when some of them have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, 'There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!'"
10,17,10,"Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men."
10,17,11,"But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person."
10,17,12,"So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one."
10,17,13,"Moreover, if he be gone into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there isn't one small stone found there."
10,17,14,"Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the"
10,17,15,"Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counseled this way."
10,17,16,"Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, 'Do not lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.'"
10,17,17,"Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David. For they might not be seen to come into the city."
10,17,18,"But a boy saw them, and told Absalom. Then they both went away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there."
10,17,19,"The woman took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and spread out bruised grain on it; and nothing was known."
10,17,20,"Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?The woman said to them, They have gone over the brook of water.When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem."
10,17,21,"It happened, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you."
10,17,22,"Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan."
10,17,23,"When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and went home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father."
10,17,24,"Then David came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him."
10,17,25,"Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother."
10,17,26,"Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead."
10,17,27,"It happened, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,"
10,17,28,"brought beds, basins, earthen vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans, lentils, roasted grain,"
10,17,29,"honey, butter, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness."
10,18,1,"David numbered the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them."
10,18,2,"David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also."
10,18,3,"But the people said, You shall not go forth; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city."
10,18,4,"The king said to them, I will do what seems best to you.The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands."
10,18,5,"The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom."
10,18,6,"So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim."
10,18,7,"The people of Israel were struck there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men."
10,18,8,"For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured."
10,18,9,"Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on."
10,18,10,"A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak."
10,18,11,"Joab said to the man who told him, Behold, you saw it, and why did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a sash."
10,18,12,"The man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still wouldn't put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, 'Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.'"
10,18,13,"Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hidden from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against me."
10,18,14,"Then Joab said, I'm not going to wait like this with you. He took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak."
10,18,15,"Ten young men who bore Joab's armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him."
10,18,16,"Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people."
10,18,17,"They took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Then all Israel fled everyone to his tent."
10,18,18,"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in memory. He called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom's monument, to this day."
10,18,19,"Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, Let me now run, and bear the king news, how that the"
10,18,20,"Joab said to him, You shall not be the bearer of news this day, but you shall bear news another day. But today you shall bear no news, because the king's son is dead."
10,18,21,"Then Joab said to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what you have seen! The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran."
10,18,22,"Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, But come what may, please let me also run after the Cushite.Joab said, Why do you want to run, my son, since that you will have no reward for the news?"
10,18,23,"But come what may, he said, I will run.He said to him, Run! Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite."
10,18,24,"Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone."
10,18,25,"The watchman cried, and told the king. The king said, If he is alone, there is news in his mouth. He came closer and closer."
10,18,26,"The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the porter, and said, Behold, a man running alone!The king said, He also brings news."
10,18,27,"The watchman said, I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.The king said, He is a good man, and comes with good news."
10,18,28,"Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed is the"
10,18,29,"The king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom?Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I do not know what it was."
10,18,30,"The king said, Turn aside, and stand here. He turned aside, and stood still."
10,18,31,"Behold, the Cushite came. The Cushite said, News for my lord the king; for the"
10,18,32,"The king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom?The Cushite answered, May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you to do you harm, be as that young man is."
10,18,33,"The king was much moved, and went up to the room over the gate, and wept. As he went, he said, My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died for you, Absalom, my son, my son!"
10,19,1,"It was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom."
10,19,2,"The victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people; for the people heard it said that day, The king grieves for his son."
10,19,3,"The people sneaked into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle."
10,19,4,"The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, My son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!"
10,19,5,"Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants, who this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;"
10,19,6,"in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you. For you have declared this day, that princes and servants are nothing to you. For today I perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it would have pleased you well."
10,19,7,"Now therefore arise, go out, and speak to comfort your servants; for I swear by the"
10,19,8,"Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. They told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate. All the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent."
10,19,9,"All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom."
10,19,10,"Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why do you not speak a word of bringing the king back?"
10,19,11,"King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, 'Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? Since the speech of all Israel has come to the king, to return him to his house."
10,19,12,"You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?'"
10,19,13,"Say to Amasa, 'Aren't you my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you aren't captain of the army before me continually in the room of Joab.'"
10,19,14,"He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as one man; so that they sent to the king, saying, Return, you and all your servants."
10,19,15,"So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan."
10,19,16,"Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David."
10,19,17,"There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king."
10,19,18,"A ferry boat went to bring over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he had come over the Jordan."
10,19,19,"He said to the king, Do not let my lord impute iniquity to me, nor remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart."
10,19,20,"For your servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore behold, I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king."
10,19,21,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, Shall Shimei not be put to death for this, because he cursed the"
10,19,22,"David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be adversaries to me? Shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? For do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?"
10,19,23,"The king said to Shimei, You shall not die. The king swore to him."
10,19,24,"Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither groomed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace."
10,19,25,"It happened, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?"
10,19,26,"He answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because your servant is lame."
10,19,27,"He has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God. Do therefore what is good in your eyes."
10,19,28,"For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king?"
10,19,29,"The king said to him, Why do you speak any more of your matters? I say, you and Ziba divide the land."
10,19,30,"Mephibosheth said to the king, Yes, let him take all, because my lord the king has come in peace to his own house."
10,19,31,"Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan."
10,19,32,"Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man."
10,19,33,"The king said to Barzillai, Come over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem."
10,19,34,"Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?"
10,19,35,"I am this day eighty years old. Can I discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?"
10,19,36,"Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?"
10,19,37,"Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you."
10,19,38,"The king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you. Whatever you require of me, that I will do for you."
10,19,39,"All the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over. Then the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place."
10,19,40,"So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him. All the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel."
10,19,41,"Behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?"
10,19,42,"All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is a close relative to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king's cost? Or has he given us any gift?"
10,19,43,"The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more claim to David than you. Why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel."
10,20,1,"There happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, Israel!"
10,20,2,"So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah joined with their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem."
10,20,3,"David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood."
10,20,4,"Then the king said to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be here present."
10,20,5,"So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him."
10,20,6,"David said to Abishai, Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get himself fortified cities, and escape out of our sight."
10,20,7,"There went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri."
10,20,8,"When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was clothed in his apparel of war that he had put on, and on it was a sash with a sword fastened on his waist in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out."
10,20,9,"Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with you, my brother? Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him."
10,20,10,"But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand. So he struck him with it in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and did not strike him again; and he died. Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri."
10,20,11,"There stood by him one of Joab's young men, and said, He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab!"
10,20,12,"Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still."
10,20,13,"When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri."
10,20,14,"He went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him."
10,20,15,"They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down."
10,20,16,"Then a wise woman cried out of the city, Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, 'Come near here, that I may speak with you.'"
10,20,17,"He came near to her; and the woman said, Are you Joab?He answered, I am.Then she said to him, Hear the words of your handmaid.He answered, I do hear."
10,20,18,"Then she spoke, saying, They were used to say in old times, 'They shall surely ask counsel at Abel;' and so they settled it."
10,20,19,"I am among those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up the inheritance of the"
10,20,20,"Joab answered, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy."
10,20,21,"The matter is not so. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David. Deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.The woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall."
10,20,22,"Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. He blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king."
10,20,23,"Now Joab was over all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;"
10,20,24,"and Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;"
10,20,25,"and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;"
10,20,26,"and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David."
10,21,1,"There was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of the"
10,21,2,"The king called the Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them: and Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah);"
10,21,3,"and David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of the"
10,21,4,"The Gibeonites said to him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.He said, Whatever you say, that will I do for you."
10,21,5,"They said to the king, The man who consumed us, and who devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,"
10,21,6,"let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to the"
10,21,7,"But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the"
10,21,8,"But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite."
10,21,9,"He delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before the"
10,21,10,"Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured on them from the sky. She allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals of the field by night."
10,21,11,"It was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done."
10,21,12,"David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa;"
10,21,13,"and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged."
10,21,14,"They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. After that God was entreated for the land."
10,21,15,"The Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. David grew faint;"
10,21,16,"and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being armed with a new sword, thought to have slain David."
10,21,17,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you do not quench the lamp of Israel."
10,21,18,"It came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the giant."
10,21,19,"There was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite's brother, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam."
10,21,20,"There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant."
10,21,21,"When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, killed him."
10,21,22,"These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants."
10,22,1,"David spoke to the"
10,22,2,"and he said,The"
10,22,3,"God, my rock, in him I will take refuge;my shield, and the horn of my salvation,my high tower, and my refuge.My savior, you save me from violence."
10,22,4,"I will call on the"
10,22,5,"For the waves of death surrounded me.The floods of ungodliness made me afraid."
10,22,6,"The cords of Sheol were around me.The snares of death caught me."
10,22,7,"In my distress I called on the"
10,22,8,"Then the earth shook and trembled.The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken,because he was angry."
10,22,9,"Smoke went up out of his nostrils.Fire out of his mouth devoured.Coals were kindled by it."
10,22,10,"He bowed the heavens also, and came down.Thick darkness was under his feet."
10,22,11,"He rode on a cherub, and flew.Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind."
10,22,12,"He made darkness pavilions around himself:gathering of waters, and thick clouds of the skies."
10,22,13,"At the brightness before him,coals of fire were kindled."
10,22,14,"The"
10,22,15,"He sent out arrows, and scattered them;lightning, and confused them."
10,22,16,"Then the channels of the sea appeared.The foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of the"
10,22,17,"He sent from on high and he took me.He drew me out of many waters."
10,22,18,"He delivered me from my strong enemy,from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me."
10,22,19,"They came on me in the day of my calamity,but the"
10,22,20,"He also brought me out into a large place.He delivered me, because he delighted in me."
10,22,21,"The"
10,22,22,"For I have kept the ways of the"
10,22,23,"For all his ordinances were before me.As for his statutes, I did not depart from them."
10,22,24,"I was also perfect toward him.I kept myself from my iniquity."
10,22,25,"Therefore the"
10,22,26,"With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect."
10,22,27,"With the pure you will show yourself pure.With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd."
10,22,28,"You will save the afflicted people,But your eyes are on the proud, that you may bring them down."
10,22,29,"For you are my lamp,"
10,22,30,"For by you, I run against a troop.By my God, I leap over a wall."
10,22,31,"As for God, his way is perfect.The word of the"
10,22,32,"For who is God, besides the"
10,22,33,"God is my strong fortress.He makes my way perfect."
10,22,34,"He makes his feet like hinds' feet,and sets me on my high places."
10,22,35,"He teaches my hands to war,so that my arms bend a bow of brass."
10,22,36,"You have also given me the shield of your salvation.Your gentleness has made me great."
10,22,37,"You have enlarged my steps under me.My feet have not slipped."
10,22,38,"I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them.I did not turn again until they were consumed."
10,22,39,"I have consumed them,and struck them through,so that they can't arise.Yes, they have fallen under my feet."
10,22,40,"For you have armed me with strength for the battle.You have subdued under me those who rose up against me."
10,22,41,"You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,that I might cut off those who hate me."
10,22,42,"They looked, but there was none to save;even to the"
10,22,43,"Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth.I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad."
10,22,44,"You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people.You have kept me to be the head of the nations.A people whom I have not known will serve me."
10,22,45,"The foreigners will submit themselves to me.As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me."
10,22,46,"The foreigners will fade away,and will come trembling out of their close places."
10,22,47,"The"
10,22,48,"even the God who executes vengeance for me,who brings down peoples under me,"
10,22,49,"who brings me away from my enemies.Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me.You deliver me from the violent man."
10,22,50,"Therefore I will give thanks to you,"
10,22,51,"He gives great deliverance to his king,and shows loving kindness to his anointed,to David and to his seed, forevermore."
10,23,1,"Now these are the last words of David.David the son of Jesse says,the man who was raised on high says,the anointed of the God of Jacob,the sweet psalmist of Israel:"
10,23,2,"The Spirit of the"
10,23,3,"The God of Israel said,the Rock of Israel spoke to me,'One who rules over men righteously,who rules in the fear of God,"
10,23,4,"shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun rises,a morning without clouds,when the tender grass springs out of the earth,through clear shining after rain.'"
10,23,5,"Most certainly my house is not so with God,yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant,ordered in all things, and sure,for it is all my salvation, and all my desire,although he doesn't make it grow."
10,23,6,"But all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away,because they can't be taken with the hand,"
10,23,7,"But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear.They shall be utterly burned with fire in their place."
10,23,8,"These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time."
10,23,9,"After him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away."
10,23,10,"He arose, and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand froze to the sword; and the"
10,23,11,"After him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. The Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines."
10,23,12,"But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the"
10,23,13,"Three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim."
10,23,14,"David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem."
10,23,15,"David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!"
10,23,16,"The three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to the"
10,23,17,"He said, Be it far from me,"
10,23,18,"Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three."
10,23,19,"Wasn't he most honorable of the three? Therefore he was made their captain: however he did not attain to the three."
10,23,20,"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow."
10,23,21,"He killed an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear."
10,23,22,"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men."
10,23,23,"He was more honorable than the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. David set him over his guard."
10,23,24,"Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,"
10,23,25,"Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,"
10,23,26,"Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,"

10,24,3,"Joab said to the king, Now may the"
10,24,4,"Notwithstanding, the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the army. Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel."
10,24,5,"They passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer:"
10,24,6,"then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; and they came to Dan Jaan, and around to Sidon,"
10,24,7,"and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba."
10,24,8,"So when they had gone back and forth through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days."
10,24,9,"Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men."
10,24,10,"David's heart struck him after that he had numbered the people. David said to the"

Or shall there be three days' pestilence in your land? Now answer, and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me."
10,24,14,"David said to Gad, I am in distress. Let us fall now into the hand of the"

10,24,21,"Araunah said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant?David said, To buy your threshing floor, to build an altar to the"
10,24,22,"Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Behold, the cattle for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:"
10,24,23,"all this, king, does Araunah give to the king. Araunah said to the king, May the"

11,1,1,"Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he couldn't keep warm."
11,1,2,"Therefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin. Let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm."
11,1,3,"So they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king."
11,1,4,"The young lady was very beautiful; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king did not know her intimately."
11,1,5,"Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king. Then he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him."
11,1,6,"His father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have you done so? and he was also a very handsome man; and he was born after Absalom."
11,1,7,"He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him."
11,1,8,"But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah."
11,1,9,"Adonijah killed sheep and cattle and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he called all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants:"
11,1,10,"but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he did not call."
11,1,11,"Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Haven't you heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn't know it?"
11,1,12,"Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon."
11,1,13,"Go in to king David, and tell him, 'Did you not, my lord, king, swear to your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?'"
11,1,14,"Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words."
11,1,15,"Bathsheba went in to the king into the room. The king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king."
11,1,16,"Bathsheba bowed, and showed respect to the king. The king said, What would you like?"
11,1,17,"She said to him, My lord, you swore by the"
11,1,18,"Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king, do not know it."
11,1,19,"He has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn't called Solomon your servant."
11,1,20,"You, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him."
11,1,21,"Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders."
11,1,22,"Behold, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in."
11,1,23,"They told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet!When he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground."
11,1,24,"Nathan said, My lord, king, have you said, 'Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?'"
11,1,25,"For he is gone down this day, and has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. Behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, 'Long live king Adonijah!'"
11,1,26,"But he hasn't called me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon."
11,1,27,"Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you haven't shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
11,1,28,"Then king David answered, Call to me Bathsheba. She came into the king's presence, and stood before the king."
11,1,29,"The king swore, and said, As the"
11,1,30,"most certainly as I swore to you by the"
11,1,31,"Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and showed respect to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live forever!"
11,1,32,"King David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. They came before the king."
11,1,33,"The king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon."
11,1,34,"Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. Blow the trumpet, and say, 'Long live king Solomon!'"
11,1,35,"Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my place. I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah."
11,1,36,"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen. May the"
11,1,37,"As the"
11,1,38,"So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon."
11,1,39,"Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet; and all the people said, Long live king Solomon!"
11,1,40,"All the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with their sound."
11,1,41,"Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?"
11,1,42,"While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are a worthy man, and bring good news."
11,1,43,"Jonathan answered Adonijah, Most certainly our lord king David has made Solomon king."
11,1,44,"The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride on the king's mule."
11,1,45,"Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. They have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that you have heard."
11,1,46,"Also, Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom."
11,1,47,"Moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, 'May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne;' and the king bowed himself on the bed."
11,1,48,"Also thus said the king, 'Blessed be the"
11,1,49,"All the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and each man went his way."
11,1,50,"Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar."
11,1,51,"It was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon; for, behold, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.'"
11,1,52,"Solomon said, If he shows himself a worthy man, not a hair of him shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die."
11,1,53,"So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed down to king Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to your house."
11,2,1,"Now the days of David drew near that he should die; and he commanded Solomon his son, saying,"
11,2,2,"I am going the way of all the earth. You be strong therefore, and show yourself a man;"
11,2,3,"and keep the instruction of the"
11,2,4,"That the"
11,2,5,"Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his sash that was about his waist, and in his shoes that were on his feet."
11,2,6,"Do therefore according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace."
11,2,7,"But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those who eat at your table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother."
11,2,8,"Behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the"
11,2,9,"Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man; and you will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood."
11,2,10,"David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David."
11,2,11,"The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem."
11,2,12,"Solomon sat on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was firmly established."
11,2,13,"Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. She said, Do you come peaceably?He said, Peaceably."
11,2,14,"He said moreover, I have something to tell you.She said, Say on."
11,2,15,"He said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign. However the kingdom is turned around, and has become my brother's; for it was his from the"
11,2,16,"Now I ask one petition of you. Do not deny me.She said to him, Say on."
11,2,17,"He said, Please speak to Solomon the king (for he will not tell you 'no'), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife."
11,2,18,"Bathsheba said, Alright. I will speak for you to the king."
11,2,19,"Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. The king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand."
11,2,20,"Then she said, I ask one small petition of you; do not deny me.The king said to her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny you."
11,2,21,"She said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife."
11,2,22,"King Solomon answered his mother, Why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah."
11,2,23,"Then king Solomon swore by the"
11,2,24,"Now therefore as the"
11,2,25,"King Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him, so that he died."
11,2,26,"To Abiathar the priest the king said, Go to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the Lord"
11,2,27,"So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to the"
11,2,28,"The news came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he did not turn after Absalom. Joab fled to the Tent of the"
11,2,29,"It was told king Solomon, Joab has fled to the Tent of the"
11,2,30,"Benaiah came to the Tent of the"
11,2,31,"The king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house."
11,2,32,"The"
11,2,33,"So shall their blood return on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed forever. But to David, and to his seed, and to his house, and to his throne, there shall be peace forever from the"
11,2,34,"Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him, and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness."
11,2,35,"The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army; and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar."
11,2,36,"The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and do not go out from there anywhere."
11,2,37,"For on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be on your own head."
11,2,38,"Shimei said to the king, The saying is good. As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days."
11,2,39,"It happened at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants are in Gath."
11,2,40,"Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath."
11,2,41,"It was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again."
11,2,42,"The king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not adjure you by the"
11,2,43,"Why then have you not kept the oath of the"
11,2,44,"The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father. Therefore the"

11,2,46,"So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died. The kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon."
11,3,1,"Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the"

11,3,5,"In Gibeon the"
11,3,6,"Solomon said, You have shown to your servant David my father great loving kindness, according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you. You have kept for him this great loving kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day."
11,3,7,"Now,"
11,3,8,"Your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen, a great people, that can't be numbered nor counted for multitude."
11,3,9,"Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this your great people?"
11,3,10,"The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing."
11,3,11,"God said to him, Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, neither have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice;"
11,3,12,"behold, I have done according to your word. Behold, I have given you a wise and an understanding heart; so that there has been none like you before you, neither after you shall any arise like you."
11,3,13,"I have also given you that which you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like you, all your days."
11,3,14,"If you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days."
11,3,15,"Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the"
11,3,16,"Then two women who were prostitutes came to the king, and stood before him."
11,3,17,"The one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house. I delivered a child with her in the house."
11,3,18,"It happened the third day after I delivered, that this woman delivered also. We were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, just us two in the house."
11,3,19,"This woman's child died in the night, because she lay on it."
11,3,20,"She arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom."
11,3,21,"When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I bore."
11,3,22,"The other woman said, No; but the living is my son, and the dead is your son.This said, No; but the dead is your son, and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king."
11,3,23,"Then the king said, The one says, 'This is my son who lives, and your son is the dead;' and the other says, 'No; but your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.'"
11,3,24,"The king said, Get me a sword. They brought a sword before the king."
11,3,25,"The king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other."
11,3,26,"Then the woman whose the living child was spoke to the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no way kill it!But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor yours. Divide it."
11,3,27,"Then the king answered, Give her the living child, and in no way kill it. She is its mother."
11,3,28,"All Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice."
11,4,1,"King Solomon was king over all Israel."
11,4,2,"These were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;"
11,4,3,"Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;"
11,4,4,"and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;"
11,4,5,"and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, the king's friend;"
11,4,6,"and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to forced labor."
11,4,7,"Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year."
11,4,8,"These are their names: Ben Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;"
11,4,9,"Ben Deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan;"
11,4,10,"Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (to him belonged Socoh, and all the land of Hepher);"
11,4,11,"Ben Abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as wife);"
11,4,12,"Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;"
11,4,13,"Ben Geber, in Ramoth Gilead (to him belonged the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him belonged the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars);"
11,4,14,"Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;"
11,4,15,"Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife);"

11,4,17,"Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;"
11,4,18,"Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;"
11,4,19,"Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer who was in the land."
11,4,20,"Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry."
11,4,21,"Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life."
11,4,22,"Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal,"
11,4,23,"ten head of fat cattle, and twenty head of cattle out of the pastures, and one hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fattened fowl."
11,4,24,"For he had dominion over all on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides around him."
11,4,25,"Judah and Israel lived safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon."
11,4,26,"Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen."
11,4,27,"Those officers provided food for king Solomon, and for all who came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking."
11,4,28,"Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they to the place where the officers were, every man according to his duty."
11,4,29,"God gave Solomon wisdom and exceptional insight, and very great understanding, even as the sand that is on the seashore."
11,4,30,"Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt."
11,4,31,"For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations all around."
11,4,32,"He spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were one thousand five."
11,4,33,"He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he spoke also of animals, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fish."
11,4,34,"There came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom."
11,5,1,"Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David."
11,5,2,"Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,"
11,5,3,"You know how that David my father could not build a house for the name of the"
11,5,4,"But now the"
11,5,5,"Behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of the"

11,5,7,"It happened, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed is the"
11,5,8,"Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard the message which you have sent to me. I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir."
11,5,9,"My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea. I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and you shall receive them. You shall accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household."
11,5,10,"So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire."
11,5,11,"Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year."
11,5,12,"The"
11,5,13,"King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men."
11,5,14,"He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor."
11,5,15,"Solomon had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains;"
11,5,16,"besides Solomon's chief officers who were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people who labored in the work."
11,5,17,"The king commanded, and they cut out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone."
11,5,18,"Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites cut them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house."
11,6,1,"It happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the"
11,6,2,"The house which king Solomon built for the"
11,6,3,"The porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was its length, according to the breadth of the house. Ten cubits was its breadth before the house."
11,6,4,"For the house he made windows of fixed lattice work."
11,6,5,"Against the wall of the house he built stories all around, against the walls of the house all around, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side rooms all around."
11,6,6,"The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the house all around, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house."
11,6,7,"The house, when it was in building, was built of stone prepared at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building."
11,6,8,"The door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story, and out of the middle into the third."
11,6,9,"So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar."
11,6,10,"He built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar."
11,6,11,"The word of the"
11,6,12,"Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father."
11,6,13,"I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel."
11,6,14,"So Solomon built the house, and finished it."
11,6,15,"He built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir."
11,6,16,"He built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling: he built them for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place."
11,6,17,"In front of the temple sanctuary was forty cubits."
11,6,18,"There was cedar on the house within, carved with buds and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen."
11,6,19,"He prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the"
11,6,20,"Within the oracle was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in its height; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar."
11,6,21,"So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold."
11,6,22,"The whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold."
11,6,23,"In the oracle he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high."
11,6,24,"Five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits."
11,6,25,"The other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form."
11,6,26,"The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub."
11,6,27,"He set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house."
11,6,28,"He overlaid the cherubim with gold."
11,6,29,"He carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, inside and outside."
11,6,30,"The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and outside."
11,6,31,"For the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood: the lintel and door posts were a fifth part of the wall."
11,6,32,"So he made two doors of olive wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees."
11,6,33,"So also made he for the entrance of the temple door posts of olive wood, out of a fourth part of the wall;"
11,6,34,"and two doors of fir wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding."
11,6,35,"He carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work."
11,6,36,"He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams."
11,6,37,"In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the"
11,6,38,"In the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all its parts, and according to all its fashion. So was he seven years in building it."
11,7,1,"Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house."
11,7,2,"For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was one hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars."
11,7,3,"It was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams, that were on the pillars; fifteen in a row."
11,7,4,"There were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks."
11,7,5,"All the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks."
11,7,6,"He made the porch of pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them."
11,7,7,"He made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor."
11,7,8,"His house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter (whom Solomon had taken as wife), like this porch."
11,7,9,"All these were of costly stones, even of cut stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court."
11,7,10,"The foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits."
11,7,11,"Above were costly stones, even cut stone, according to measure, and cedar wood."
11,7,12,"The great court around had three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of the"
11,7,13,"King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre."
11,7,14,"He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. He came to king Solomon, and performed all his work."
11,7,15,"For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits encircled either of them about."
11,7,16,"He made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits."
11,7,17,"There were nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital."
11,7,18,"So he made the pillars; and there were two rows around on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars: and he did so for the other capital."
11,7,19,"The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work, four cubits."
11,7,20,"There were capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows around on the other capital."
11,7,21,"He set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz."
11,7,22,"On the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished."
11,7,23,"He made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it."
11,7,24,"Under its brim around there were buds which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea: the buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast."
11,7,25,"It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward."
11,7,26,"It was a handbreadth thick: and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths."
11,7,27,"He made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height."
11,7,28,"The work of the bases was like this: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;"
11,7,29,"and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work."
11,7,30,"Every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet of it had supports: beneath the basin were the supports molten, with wreaths at the side of each."
11,7,31,"The mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and its mouth was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its mouth were engravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round."
11,7,32,"The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit."
11,7,33,"The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten."
11,7,34,"There were four supports at the four corners of each base: its supports were of the base itself."
11,7,35,"In the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same."
11,7,36,"On the plates of its stays, and on its panels, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around."
11,7,37,"In this way, he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form."
11,7,38,"He made ten basins of brass: one basin contained forty baths; and every basin was four cubits; and on every one of the ten bases one basin."
11,7,39,"He set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south."
11,7,40,"Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of the"
11,7,41,"the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;"
11,7,42,"and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;"
11,7,43,"and the ten bases, and the ten basins on the bases;"
11,7,44,"and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;"
11,7,45,"and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of the"
11,7,46,"The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan."
11,7,47,"Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out."
11,7,48,"Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the"
11,7,49,"and the lampstands, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;"
11,7,50,"and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, of the temple, of gold."
11,7,51,"Thus all the work that king Solomon worked in the house of the"
11,8,1,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers' households of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the"
11,8,2,"All the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month."
11,8,3,"All the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark."
11,8,4,"They brought up the ark of the"
11,8,5,"King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude."
11,8,6,"The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the"
11,8,7,"For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above."
11,8,8,"The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there they are to this day."
11,8,9,"There was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when the"
11,8,10,"It came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the"
11,8,11,"so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of the"
11,8,12,"Then Solomon said, The"
11,8,13,"I have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you to dwell in forever."
11,8,14,"The king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood."
11,8,15,"He said, Blessed is the"
11,8,16,"'Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.'"
11,8,17,"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the"
11,8,18,"But the"
11,8,19,"Nevertheless, you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come forth out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.'"
11,8,20,"The"
11,8,21,"There I have set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the"
11,8,22,"Solomon stood before the altar of the"
11,8,23,"and he said, "
11,8,24,"who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him. Yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day."
11,8,25,"Now therefore, may the"
11,8,26,"Now therefore, God of Israel, please let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David my father."
11,8,27,"But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can't contain you; how much less this house that I have built!"
11,8,28,"Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant, and for his supplication,"
11,8,29,"that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you have said, 'My name shall be there;' to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place."
11,8,30,"Listen to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place. Yes, hear in heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive."
11,8,31,"If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swear before your altar in this house;"
11,8,32,"then hear in heaven, and do, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness."
11,8,33,"When your people Israel are struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you; if they turn again to you, and confess your name, and pray and make supplication to you in this house:"
11,8,34,"then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers."
11,8,35,"When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them:"
11,8,36,"then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance."
11,8,37,"If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight, mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there is;"
11,8,38,"whatever prayer and supplication is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who shall each know the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:"
11,8,39,"then hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts of all the children of men;)"
11,8,40,"that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers."
11,8,41,"Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for your name's sake"
11,8,42,"(for they shall hear of your great name, and of your mighty hand, and of your outstretched arm); when he shall come and pray toward this house;"
11,8,43,"hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name."
11,8,44,"If your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to the"
11,8,45,"then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
11,8,46,"If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn't sin), and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near;"
11,8,47,"yet if they shall repent in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive, saying, 'We have sinned, and have done perversely; we have dealt wickedly;'"
11,8,48,"if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name:"
11,8,49,"then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven, your dwelling place, and maintain their cause;"
11,8,50,"and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against you; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them"
11,8,51,"(for they are your people, and your inheritance, which you brought out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron);"
11,8,52,"that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant, and to the supplication of your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they cry to you."
11,8,53,"For you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be your inheritance, as you spoke by Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, Lord"
11,8,54,"It was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to the"

11,9,6,"But if you turn away from following me, you or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;"
11,9,7,"then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples."

11,9,11,"(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee."
11,9,12,"Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they did not please him."
11,9,13,"He said, What cities are these which you have given me, my brother? He called them the land of Cabul to this day."
11,9,14,"Hiram sent to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold."
11,9,15,"This is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of the"
11,9,16,"Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it for a portion to his daughter, Solomon's wife."
11,9,17,"Solomon built Gezer, and Beth Horon the lower,"
11,9,18,"and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,"
11,9,19,"and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion."
11,9,20,"As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel;"
11,9,21,"their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day."
11,9,22,"But of the children of Israel Solomon made no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen."
11,9,23,"These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work, five hundred fifty, who bore rule over the people who labored in the work."
11,9,24,"But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her: then he built Millo."
11,9,25,"Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the"
11,9,26,"King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom."
11,9,27,"Hiram sent in the navy his servants, sailors who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon."
11,9,28,"They came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon."
11,10,1,"When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the"
11,10,2,"She came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she had come to Solomon, she talked with him of all that was in her heart."
11,10,3,"Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hidden from the king which he did not tell her."
11,10,4,"When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,"
11,10,5,"and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their clothing, and his cup bearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of the"
11,10,6,"She said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom."
11,10,7,"However I did not believe the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it. Behold, the half was not told me! Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard."
11,10,8,"Happy are your men, happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, who hear your wisdom."
11,10,9,"Blessed is the"
11,10,10,"She gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones. There came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon."
11,10,11,"The navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones."
11,10,12,"The king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the"
11,10,13,"King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants."
11,10,14,"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,"
11,10,15,"besides that which the traders brought, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mixed people, and of the governors of the country."
11,10,16,"King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler."
11,10,17,"He made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon."
11,10,18,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold."
11,10,19,"There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays."
11,10,20,"Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was nothing like it made in any kingdom."
11,10,21,"All king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon."
11,10,22,"For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks."
11,10,23,"So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom."
11,10,24,"All the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart."
11,10,25,"They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year."
11,10,26,"Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem."
11,10,27,"The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance."
11,10,28,"The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price."
11,10,29,"A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, they brought them out by their means."
11,11,1,"Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;"
11,11,2,"of the nations concerning which the"
11,11,3,"He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart."
11,11,4,"For it happened, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with the"

11,11,8,"So he did for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods."

11,11,14,"The"
11,11,15,"For it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain, and had struck every male in Edom"
11,11,16,"(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);"
11,11,17,"that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child."
11,11,18,"They arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him food, and gave him land."
11,11,19,"Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen."
11,11,20,"The sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh."
11,11,21,"When Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country."
11,11,22,"Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you seek to go to your own country?He answered, Nothing, however only let me depart."
11,11,23,"God raised up an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah."
11,11,24,"He gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop, when David killed them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus."
11,11,25,"He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief of Hadad: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria."
11,11,26,"Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king."
11,11,27,"This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father."
11,11,28,"The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph."
11,11,29,"It happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field."
11,11,30,"Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces."
11,11,31,"He said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces; for thus says the"
11,11,32,"(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David's sake and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);"
11,11,33,"because that they have forsaken me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon. They have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my ordinances, as David his father did."
11,11,34,"'However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant's sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;"
11,11,35,"but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes."
11,11,36,"To his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there."
11,11,37,"I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel."
11,11,38,"It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you."
11,11,39,"I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not forever.'"
11,11,40,"Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon."
11,11,41,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, aren't they written in the book of the acts of Solomon?"
11,11,42,"The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years."
11,11,43,"Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place."
11,12,1,"Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king."
11,12,2,"It happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt,"
11,12,3,"and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,"
11,12,4,"Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you."
11,12,5,"He said to them, Depart for three days, then come back to me.The people departed."
11,12,6,"King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people?"
11,12,7,"They spoke to him, saying, If you will be a servant to this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever."
11,12,8,"But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him."
11,12,9,"He said to them, What counsel do you give, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, 'Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?'"
11,12,10,"The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus you shall tell this people who spoke to you, saying, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter to us;' you shall say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist."
11,12,11,"Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.'"
11,12,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, Come to me again the third day."
11,12,13,"The king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,"
11,12,14,"and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."
11,12,15,"So the king did not listen to the people; for it was a thing brought about of the"
11,12,16,"When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? Neither do we have an inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents."
11,12,17,"But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them."
11,12,18,"Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem."
11,12,19,"So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day."
11,12,20,"It happened, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none who followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only."
11,12,21,"When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon."
11,12,22,"But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,"
11,12,23,"Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,"
11,12,24,"'Thus says the"
11,12,25,"Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived in it; and he went out from there, and built Penuel."
11,12,26,"Jeroboam said in his heart, Now the kingdom will return to the house of David."
11,12,27,"If this people goes up to offer sacrifices in the house of the"
11,12,28,"Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Look and see your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt!"
11,12,29,"He set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan."
11,12,30,"This thing became a sin; for the people went to worship before the one, even to Dan."
11,12,31,"He made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi."
11,12,32,"Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; he did so in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made."
11,12,33,"He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar, to burn incense."
11,13,1,"Behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the"
11,13,2,"He cried against the altar by the word of the"
11,13,3,"He gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the"
11,13,4,"It happened, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, that Jeroboam put out his hand from the altar, saying, Seize him! His hand, which he put out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to himself."
11,13,5,"The altar also was split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the"
11,13,6,"The king answered the man of God, Now entreat the favor of the"
11,13,7,"The king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward."
11,13,8,"The man of God said to the king, Even if you gave me half of your house, I would not go in with you, neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place;"
11,13,9,"for so was it commanded me by the word of the"
11,13,10,"So he went another way, and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel."
11,13,11,"Now there lived an old prophet in Bethel; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king."
11,13,12,"Their father said to them, Which way did he go? Now his sons had seen which way the man of God went, who came from Judah."
11,13,13,"He said to his sons, Saddle the donkey for me. So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it."
11,13,14,"He went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. He said to him, Are you the man of God who came from Judah?He said, I am."
11,13,15,"Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread."
11,13,16,"He said, I may not return with you, nor go in with you; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place."
11,13,17,"For it was said to me by the word of the"
11,13,18,"He said to him, I also am a prophet as you are; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the"
11,13,19,"So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water."
11,13,20,"It happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of the"
11,13,21,"and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, Thus says the"
11,13,22,"but came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, Eat no bread, and drink no water; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.'"
11,13,23,"It happened, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back."
11,13,24,"When he had gone, a lion met him by the way, and killed him. His body was cast in the way, and the donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the body."
11,13,25,"Behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived."
11,13,26,"When the prophet who brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, It is the man of God who was disobedient to the mouth of the"
11,13,27,"He spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle the donkey for me. They saddled it."
11,13,28,"He went and found his body cast in the way, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body. The lion had not eaten the body, nor mauled the donkey."
11,13,29,"The prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. He came to the city of the old prophet to mourn, and to bury him."
11,13,30,"He laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!"
11,13,31,"It happened, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones."
11,13,32,"For the saying which he cried by the word of the"
11,13,33,"After this thing Jeroboam did not return from his evil way, but again made priests of the high places from among all the people. Whoever wanted to, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places."
11,13,34,"This thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth."
11,14,1,"At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick."
11,14,2,"Jeroboam said to his wife, Please get up and disguise yourself, that you won't be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Go to Shiloh. Behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spoke concerning me that I should be king over this people."
11,14,3,"Take with you ten loaves, and cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will become of the child."
11,14,4,"Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age."
11,14,5,"The"
11,14,6,"It was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, you wife of Jeroboam! Why do you pretend to be another? For I am sent to you with heavy news."
11,14,7,"Go, tell Jeroboam, 'Thus says the"
11,14,8,"and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it you; and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in my eyes,"
11,14,9,"but have done evil above all who were before you, and have gone and made you other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back:"
11,14,10,"therefore, behold, I will bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who urinates on a wall, he who is shut up and he who is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweeps away dung, until it is all gone."
11,14,11,"He who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat: for the"
11,14,12,"Arise therefore, and go to your house. When your feet enter into the city, the child shall die."
11,14,13,"All Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the"
11,14,14,"Moreover the"
11,14,15,"For the"
11,14,16,"He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he has sinned, and with which he has made Israel to sin."
11,14,17,"Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah. As she came to the threshold of the house, the child died."
11,14,18,"All Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word of the"
11,14,19,"The rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel."
11,14,20,"The days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place."
11,14,21,"Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the"
11,14,22,"Judah did that which was evil in the sight of the"

11,14,30,"There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually."
11,14,31,"Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. Abijam his son reigned in his place."
11,15,1,"Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah."
11,15,2,"He reigned three years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom."
11,15,3,"He walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with the"

11,15,7,"The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam."
11,15,8,"Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his place."
11,15,9,"In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah."
11,15,10,"He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom."
11,15,11,"Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the"

11,15,13,"Also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron."

11,15,21,"It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and lived in Tirzah."
11,15,22,"Then king Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; none was exempted: and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah."
11,15,23,"Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet."

11,16,16,"The people who were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired, and has also struck the king: therefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp."
11,16,17,"Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah."
11,16,18,"It happened, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died,"
11,16,19,"for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of the"
11,16,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he committed, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,16,21,"Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri."
11,16,22,"But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned."
11,16,23,"In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel for twelve years. He reigned six years in Tirzah."
11,16,24,"He bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria."
11,16,25,"Omri did that which was evil in the sight of the"
11,16,26,"For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke the"
11,16,27,"Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,16,28,"So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his place."
11,16,29,"In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years."
11,16,30,"Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of the"
11,16,31,"It happened, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him."
11,16,32,"He reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria."
11,16,33,"Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke the"
11,16,34,"In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho: he laid its foundation with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the"
11,17,1,"Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the foreigners of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the"
11,17,2,"The word of the"
11,17,3,"Go away from here, turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan."
11,17,4,"It shall be, that you shall drink of the brook. I have commanded the ravens to feed you there."
11,17,5,"So he went and did according to the word of the"
11,17,6,"The ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook."
11,17,7,"It happened after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land."
11,17,8,"The word of the"
11,17,9,"Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain you."
11,17,10,"So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Please get me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink."
11,17,11,"As she was going to get it, he called to her, and said, Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand."
11,17,12,"She said, As the"
11,17,13,"Elijah said to her, Do not be afraid. Go and do as you have said; but make me of it a little cake first, and bring it out to me, and afterward make some for you and for your son."
11,17,14,"For thus says the"
11,17,15,"She went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, ate many days."
11,17,16,"The jar of meal did not empty, neither did the jar of oil fail, according to the word of the"
11,17,17,"It happened after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so severe, that there was no breath left in him."
11,17,18,"She said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, you man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to memory, and to kill my son!"
11,17,19,"He said to her, Give me your son. He took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the room where he stayed, and laid him on his own bed."
11,17,20,"He cried to the"
11,17,21,"He stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to the"
11,17,22,"The"
11,17,23,"Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the room into the house, and delivered him to his mother; and Elijah said, Behold, your son lives."
11,17,24,"The woman said to Elijah, Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the"
11,18,1,"It happened after many days, that the word of the"
11,18,2,"Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria."
11,18,3,"Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the"
11,18,4,"for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the"
11,18,5,"Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land, to all the springs of water, and to all the brooks. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose all the animals."
11,18,6,"So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself."
11,18,7,"As Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it you, my lord Elijah?"
11,18,8,"He answered him, It is I. Go, tell your lord, 'Behold, Elijah is here!'"
11,18,9,"He said, Wherein have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?"
11,18,10,"As the"
11,18,11,"Now you say, 'Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here.'"
11,18,12,"It will happen, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of the"
11,18,13,"Wasn't it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the"
11,18,14,"Now you say, 'Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here;' and he will kill me."
11,18,15,"Elijah said, As the"
11,18,16,"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah."
11,18,17,"It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Is that you, you troubler of Israel?"
11,18,18,"He answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your father's house, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the"
11,18,19,"Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel, and four hundred fifty of the prophets of Baal, and four hundred of the prophets of the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table."
11,18,20,"So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to Mount Carmel."
11,18,21,"Elijah came near to all the people, and said, How long will you waver between the two sides? If the"
11,18,22,"Then Elijah said to the people, I, even I only, am left a prophet of the"
11,18,23,"Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bull, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under it."
11,18,24,"You call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the"
11,18,25,"Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose one bull for yourselves, and dress it first; for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it."
11,18,26,"They took the bull which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any who answered. They leaped about the altar which was made."
11,18,27,"It happened at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he has gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps and must be awakened."
11,18,28,"They cried aloud, and cut themselves in their way with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them."
11,18,29,"It was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the offering; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any who regarded."
11,18,30,"Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me; and all the people came near to him. He repaired the altar of the"
11,18,31,"Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the"
11,18,32,"With the stones he built an altar in the name of the"
11,18,33,"He put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood."
11,18,34,"He said, Do it a second time; and they did it the second time. He said, Do it a third time; and they did it the third time."
11,18,35,"The water ran around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water."
11,18,36,"It happened at the time of the offering of the offering, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, "
11,18,37,"Hear me,"
11,18,38,"Then the fire of the"
11,18,39,"When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces. They said, The"
11,18,40,"Elijah said to them, Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let one of them escape!They seized them. Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there."
11,18,41,"Elijah said to Ahab, Get up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain."
11,18,42,"So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees."
11,18,43,"He said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea.He went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing.He said, Go again seven times."
11,18,44,"It happened at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, a small cloud, like a man's hand, is rising out of the sea.He said, Go up, tell Ahab, 'Get ready and go down, so that the rain doesn't stop you.'"
11,18,45,"It happened in a little while, that the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel."
11,18,46,"The hand of the"
11,19,1,"Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword."
11,19,2,"Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time!"
11,19,3,"When he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there."
11,19,4,"But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough. Now, O"
11,19,5,"He lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat!"
11,19,6,"He looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on the coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank, and lay down again."
11,19,7,"The angel of the"
11,19,8,"He arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the Mount of God."
11,19,9,"He came there to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of the"
11,19,10,"He said, I have been very jealous for the"
11,19,11,"He said, Go out, and stand on the mountain before the"
11,19,12,"After the earthquake a fire passed; but the"
11,19,13,"It was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. Behold, a voice came to him, and said, What are you doing here, Elijah?"
11,19,14,"He said, I have been very jealous for the"
11,19,15,"The"
11,19,16,"You shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Israel; and you shall anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah to be prophet in your place."
11,19,17,"It shall happen, that he who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will kill."
11,19,18,"Yet will I leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him."
11,19,19,"So he departed there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over to him, and cast his mantle on him."
11,19,20,"He left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me please kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.He said to him, Go back again; for what have I done to you?"
11,19,21,"He returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and served him."
11,20,1,"Ben Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together; and there were thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it."
11,20,2,"He sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said to him, Thus says Ben Hadad,"
11,20,3,"'Your silver and your gold is mine. Your wives also and your children, even the best, are mine.'"
11,20,4,"The king of Israel answered, It is according to your saying, my lord, O king. I am yours, and all that I have."
11,20,5,"The messengers came again, and said, Ben Hadad says, 'I sent indeed to you, saying, You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children;"
11,20,6,"but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house, and the houses of your servants; and it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.'"
11,20,7,"Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Please notice how this man seeks mischief; for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I did not deny him."
11,20,8,"All the elders and all the people said to him, Do not listen, neither consent."
11,20,9,"Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, Tell my lord the king, 'All that you sent for to your servant at the first I will do; but this thing I cannot do.'The messengers departed, and brought him back the message."
11,20,10,"Ben Hadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me."
11,20,11,"The king of Israel answered, Tell him, 'Do not let him who puts on his armor brag like he who takes it off.'"
11,20,12,"It happened, when Ben Hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the pavilions, that he said to his servants, Prepare to attack! They prepared to attack the city."
11,20,13,"Behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus says the"
11,20,14,"Ahab said, By whom?He said, Thus says the"
11,20,15,"Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two. After them, he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand."
11,20,16,"They went out at noon. But Ben Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings who helped him."
11,20,17,"The young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, Men are coming out from Samaria."
11,20,18,"He said, If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive."
11,20,19,"So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them."
11,20,20,"They each killed his man. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen."
11,20,21,"The king of Israel went out, and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter."
11,20,22,"The prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you."
11,20,23,"The servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we. But let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they."
11,20,24,"Do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their place."
11,20,25,"Muster an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. We will fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than them.He listened to their voice, and did so."
11,20,26,"It happened at the return of the year, that Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel."
11,20,27,"The children of Israel were mustered, and were provisioned, and went against them. The children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of young goats; but the Syrians filled the country."
11,20,28,"A man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus says the"
11,20,29,"They encamped one over against the other seven days. So it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand footmen of the Syrians in one day."
11,20,30,"But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who were left. Ben Hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner room."
11,20,31,"His servants said to him, See now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please let us put sackcloth on our bodies, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Maybe he will save your life."
11,20,32,"So they put sackcloth on their bodies and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Your servant Ben Hadad says, 'Please let me live.'He said, Is he still alive? He is my brother."
11,20,33,"Now the men observed diligently, and hurried to take this phrase; and they said, Your brother Ben Hadad.Then he said, Go, bring him.Then Ben Hadad came out to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot."
11,20,34,"Ben Hadad said to him, The cities which my father took from your father I will restore. You shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.I, said Ahab, will let you go with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and let him go."
11,20,35,"A certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of the"
11,20,36,"Then he said to him, Because you have not obeyed the voice of the"
11,20,37,"Then he found another man, and said, Please strike me.The man struck him, smiting and wounding him."
11,20,38,"So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes."
11,20,39,"As the king passed by, he cried to the king; and he said, Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, 'Guard this man! If by any means he be missing, then your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.'"
11,20,40,"As your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.The king of Israel said to him, So your judgment shall be; you yourself have decided it."
11,20,41,"He hurried, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized that he was of the prophets."
11,20,42,"He said to him, Thus says the"
11,20,43,"The king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria."
11,21,1,"It happened after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria."
11,21,2,"Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near to my house; and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it. Or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its worth in money."
11,21,3,"Naboth said to Ahab, May the"
11,21,4,"Ahab came into his house sullen and angry because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. He laid himself down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread."
11,21,5,"But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?"
11,21,6,"He said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, 'Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for it.' He answered, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'"
11,21,7,"Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry. I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
11,21,8,"So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city, who lived with Naboth."
11,21,9,"She wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people."
11,21,10,"Set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them testify against him, saying, 'You cursed God and the king!' Then carry him out, and stone him to death."
11,21,11,"The men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them."
11,21,12,"They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people."
11,21,13,"The two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him. The base fellows testified against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth cursed God and the king! Then they carried him out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones."
11,21,14,"Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth has been stoned, and is dead."
11,21,15,"It happened, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead."
11,21,16,"It happened, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it."
11,21,17,"The word of the"
11,21,18,"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to take possession of it."
11,21,19,"You shall speak to him, saying, 'Thus says the"
11,21,20,"Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, my enemy?He answered, I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of the"
11,21,21,"Behold, I will bring disaster on you, and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone, slave or free in Israel."
11,21,22,"I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin."
11,21,23,"The"
11,21,24,"The dogs will eat he who dies of Ahab in the city; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field."
11,21,25,"But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of the"
11,21,26,"He did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom the"
11,21,27,"It happened, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly."
11,21,28,"The word of the"
11,21,29,"See how Ahab humbles himself before me? Because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the disaster in his days; but in his son's days will I bring the disaster on his house."
11,22,1,"They continued three years without war between Syria and Israel."
11,22,2,"It happened in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel."
11,22,3,"The king of Israel said to his servants, You know that Ramoth Gilead is ours, and we are still, and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?"
11,22,4,"He said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth Gilead?Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
11,22,5,"Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire first for the word of the"
11,22,6,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?They said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king."
11,22,7,"But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophet of the"
11,22,8,"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the"
11,22,9,"Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Quickly get Micaiah the son of Imlah."
11,22,10,"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them."
11,22,11,"Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus says the"

11,22,13,"The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, See now, the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak good."
11,22,14,"Micaiah said, As the"
11,22,15,"When he had come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?He answered him, Go up and prosper; and the"

11,22,17,"He said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. The"
11,22,18,"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"
11,22,19,"Micaiah said, Therefore hear the word of the"
11,22,20,"The"
11,22,21,"A spirit came out and stood before the"
11,22,22,"The"
11,22,23,"Now therefore, behold, the"

11,22,25,"Micaiah said, Behold, you will see on that day, when you go into an inner room to hide yourself."
11,22,26,"The king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son."
11,22,27,"Say, 'Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.'"
11,22,28,"Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, the"
11,22,29,"So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead."
11,22,30,"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes. The king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle."
11,22,31,"Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel."
11,22,32,"It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely that is the king of Israel! and they turned aside to fight against him. Jehoshaphat cried out."
11,22,33,"It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him."
11,22,34,"A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the battle; for I am severely wounded."
11,22,35,"The battle increased that day. The king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, and died at evening. The blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot."
11,22,36,"A cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country!"
11,22,37,"So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria."
11,22,38,"They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves; according to the word of the"
11,22,39,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,22,40,"So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place."
11,22,41,"Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel."
11,22,42,"Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi."
11,22,43,"He walked in all the way of Asa his father; He did not turn aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the"
11,22,44,"Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel."
11,22,45,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
11,22,46,"The remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land."
11,22,47,"There was no king in Edom: a deputy was king."
11,22,48,"Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they did not go; for the ships were broken at Ezion Geber."
11,22,49,"Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not."
11,22,50,"Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; Jehoram his son reigned in his place."
11,22,51,"Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel."
11,22,52,"He did that which was evil in the sight of the"
11,22,53,"He served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger the"
12,1,1,"Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab."
12,1,2,"Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness."
12,1,3,"But the angel of the"
12,1,4,"Now therefore thus says the"
12,1,5,"The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, Why is it that you have returned?"
12,1,6,"They said to him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, 'Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, Thus says the"
12,1,7,"He said to them, What kind of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?"
12,1,8,"They answered him, He was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist.He said, It is Elijah the Tishbite."
12,1,9,"Then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to him, Man of God, the king has said, 'Come down!'"
12,1,10,"Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty! Fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty."
12,1,11,"Again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty. He answered him, Man of God, the king has said, 'Come down quickly!'"
12,1,12,"Elijah answered them, If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty! The fire of God came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty."
12,1,13,"Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, Man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your sight."
12,1,14,"Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight."
12,1,15,"The angel of the"
12,1,16,"He said to him, Thus says the"
12,1,17,"So he died according to the word of the"
12,1,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,2,1,"It happened, when the"
12,2,2,"Elijah said to Elisha, Please wait here, for the"
12,2,3,"The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, Do you know that the"
12,2,4,"Elijah said to him, Elisha, please wait here, for the"
12,2,5,"The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, Do you know that the"
12,2,6,"Elijah said to him, Please wait here, for the"
12,2,7,"Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Jordan."
12,2,8,"Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they two went over on dry ground."
12,2,9,"It happened, when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.Elisha said, Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me."
12,2,10,"He said, You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so."
12,2,11,"It happened, as they still went on, and talked, that behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven."
12,2,12,"Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!He saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces."
12,2,13,"He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan."
12,2,14,"He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, Where is the"
12,2,15,"When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha. They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him."
12,2,16,"They said to him, See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the"
12,2,17,"When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, Send them.They sent therefore fifty men; and they searched for three days, but did not find him."
12,2,18,"They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, Did I not tell you, 'Do not go?'"
12,2,19,"The men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land miscarries."
12,2,20,"He said, Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it. They brought it to him."
12,2,21,"He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, Thus says the"
12,2,22,"So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke."
12,2,23,"He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldhead!"
12,2,24,"He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of the"
12,2,25,"He went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria."
12,3,1,"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years."
12,3,2,"He did that which was evil in the sight of the"
12,3,3,"Nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart from it."
12,3,4,"Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs, and of one hundred thousand rams."
12,3,5,"But it happened, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel."
12,3,6,"King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel."
12,3,7,"He went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me against Moab to battle?He said, I will go up. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
12,3,8,"He said, Which way shall we go up?He answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom."
12,3,9,"So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days' journey. There was no water for the army, nor for the animals that followed them."
12,3,10,"The king of Israel said, Alas! For the"
12,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophet of the"
12,3,12,"Jehoshaphat said, The word of the"
12,3,13,"Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.The king of Israel said to him, No; for the"
12,3,14,"Elisha said, As the"
12,3,15,"But now bring me a minstrel. It happened, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the"
12,3,16,"He said, Thus says the"
12,3,17,"For thus says the"
12,3,18,"This is but a light thing in the sight of the"
12,3,19,"You shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.'"
12,3,20,"It happened in the morning, about the time of offering the offering, that behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water."
12,3,21,"Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border."
12,3,22,"They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood."
12,3,23,"They said, This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!"
12,3,24,"When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites."
12,3,25,"They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the springs of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth only they left its stones; however the men armed with slings went about it, and struck it."
12,3,26,"When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not."
12,3,27,"Then he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land."
12,4,1,"Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead. You know that your servant feared the"
12,4,2,"Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? Tell me: what do you have in the house?She said, Your handmaid has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil."
12,4,3,"Then he said, Go, borrow containers from of all your neighbors, even empty containers. Do not borrow just a few."
12,4,4,"You shall go in, and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour out into all those containers; and you shall set aside that which is full."
12,4,5,"So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons; they brought the containers to her, and she poured out."
12,4,6,"It happened, when the containers were full, that she said to her son, Bring me another container.He said to her, There isn't another container. The oil stopped flowing."
12,4,7,"Then she came and told the man of God. He said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest."
12,4,8,"It fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread."
12,4,9,"She said to her husband, See now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us continually."
12,4,10,"Please let us make a little room on the wall. Let us set for him there a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp stand. It shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there."
12,4,11,"One day he came there, and he turned into the room and lay there."
12,4,12,"He said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. When he had called her, she stood before him."
12,4,13,"He said to him, Say now to her, 'Behold, you have cared for us with all this care. What is to be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army?'She answered, I dwell among my own people."
12,4,14,"He said, What then is to be done for her?Gehazi answered, Most certainly she has no son, and her husband is old."
12,4,15,"He said, Call her. When he had called her, she stood in the door."
12,4,16,"He said, At this season, when the time comes around, you will embrace a son.She said, No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your handmaid."
12,4,17,"The woman conceived, and bore a son at that season, when the time came around, as Elisha had said to her."
12,4,18,"When the child was grown, it happened one day that he went out to his father to the reapers."
12,4,19,"He said to his father, My head! My head!He said to his servant, Carry him to his mother."
12,4,20,"When he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died."
12,4,21,"She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door on him, and went out."
12,4,22,"She called to her husband, and said, Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again."
12,4,23,"He said, Why would you want go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath.She said, It's alright."
12,4,24,"Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward! Do not slow down for me, unless I ask you to."
12,4,25,"So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. It happened, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, there is the Shunammite."
12,4,26,"Please run now to meet her, and ask her, 'Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?'She answered, It is well."
12,4,27,"When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Leave her alone; for her soul is troubled within her; and the"
12,4,28,"Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? Did I not say, Do not deceive me?"
12,4,29,"Then he said to Gehazi, Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him again. Then lay my staff on the face of the child."
12,4,30,"The mother of the child said, As the"
12,4,31,"Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child has not awakened."
12,4,32,"When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and lay on his bed."
12,4,33,"He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to the"
12,4,34,"He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child grew warm."
12,4,35,"Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes."
12,4,36,"He called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite! So he called her.When she had come in to him, he said, Take up your son."
12,4,37,"Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out."
12,4,38,"Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets."
12,4,39,"One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of stew; for they did not recognize them."
12,4,40,"So they poured out for the men to eat. It happened, as they were eating of the stew, that they cried out, and said, Man of God, there is death in the pot! They could not eat of it."
12,4,41,"But he said, Then bring meal. He cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. There was no harm in the pot."
12,4,42,"A man from Baal Shalishah came, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. He said, Give to the people, that they may eat."
12,4,43,"His servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men?But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus says the"
12,4,44,"So he set it before them, and they ate, and left some of it, according to the word of the"
12,5,1,"Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him the"
12,5,2,"The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman's wife."
12,5,3,"She said to her mistress, I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would heal him of his leprosy."
12,5,4,"Someone went in, and told his lord, saying, The maiden who is from the land of Israel said this."
12,5,5,"The king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing."
12,5,6,"He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy."
12,5,7,"It happened, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me."
12,5,8,"It was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel."
12,5,9,"So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha."
12,5,10,"Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean."
12,5,11,"But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, 'He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the"
12,5,12,"Aren't Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn't I wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage."
12,5,13,"His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had asked you do some great thing, wouldn't you have done it? How much rather then, when he says to you, 'Wash, and be clean?'"
12,5,14,"Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean."
12,5,15,"He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant."
12,5,16,"But he said, As the"
12,5,17,"Naaman said, If not, then, please let two mules' burden of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to the"
12,5,18,"In this thing may the"
12,5,19,"He said to him, Go in peace.So he departed from him a little way."
12,5,20,"But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As the"
12,5,21,"So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?"
12,5,22,"He said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, 'Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.'"
12,5,23,"Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they carried them before him."
12,5,24,"When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they departed."
12,5,25,"But he went in, and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, Where did you come from, Gehazi?He said, Your servant went nowhere."
12,5,26,"He said to him, Did not my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants?"
12,5,27,"Therefore the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your seed forever.He went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow."
12,6,1,"The sons of the prophets said to Elisha, See now, the place where we dwell before you is too small for us."
12,6,2,"Please let us go to the Jordan, and every man take a beam from there, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell.He answered, Go!"
12,6,3,"One said, Please be pleased to go with your servants.He answered, I will go."
12,6,4,"So he went with them. When they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood."
12,6,5,"But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water. Then he cried, and said, Alas, my master! For it was borrowed."
12,6,6,"The man of God asked, Where did it fall? He showed him the place. He cut down a stick, threw it in there, and made the iron float."
12,6,7,"He said, Take it. So he put out his hand and took it."
12,6,8,"Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, My camp will be in such and such a place."
12,6,9,"The man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that you not pass such a place; for the Syrians are coming down there."
12,6,10,"The king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice."
12,6,11,"The heart of the king of Syria was very troubled about this. He called his servants, and said to them, Won't you show me which of us is for the king of Israel?"
12,6,12,"One of his servants said, No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom."
12,6,13,"He said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and get him.It was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan."
12,6,14,"Therefore he sent horses, chariots, and a great army there. They came by night, and surrounded the city."
12,6,15,"When the servant of the man of God had risen early, and gone out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was around the city. His servant said to him, Alas, my master! What shall we do?"
12,6,16,"He answered, Do not be afraid; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them."
12,6,17,"Elisha prayed, and said, "
12,6,18,"When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the"
12,6,19,"Elisha said to them, This is not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek. He led them to Samaria."
12,6,20,"It happened, when they had come into Samaria, that Elisha said, "
12,6,21,"The king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I strike them? Shall I strike them?"
12,6,22,"He answered, You shall not strike them. Would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master."
12,6,23,"He prepared great feast for them. When they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. The bands of Syria stopped raiding the land of Israel."
12,6,24,"It happened after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria."
12,6,25,"There was a great famine in Samaria. Behold, they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver."
12,6,26,"As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king!"
12,6,27,"He said, If the"
12,6,28,"The king said to her, What ails you?She answered, This woman said to me, 'Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.'"
12,6,29,"So we boiled my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the next day, 'Give your son, that we may eat him;' and she has hidden her son."
12,6,30,"It happened, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes (now he was passing by on the wall); and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth underneath on his flesh."
12,6,31,"Then he said, God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stay on him this day."
12,6,32,"But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Then the king sent a man from before him; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door shut against him. Isn't the sound of his master's feet behind him?"
12,6,33,"While he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him. Then he said, Behold, this disaster is from the"
12,7,1,"Elisha said, Hear the word of the"
12,7,2,"Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the"
12,7,3,"Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate. They said one to another, Why do we sit here until we die?"
12,7,4,"If we say, 'We will enter into the city,' then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. If we sit still here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let us surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we will live; and if they kill us, we will only die."
12,7,5,"They rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians. When they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there."
12,7,6,"For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great army: and they said one to another, Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us."
12,7,7,"Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life."
12,7,8,"When these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drink, and carried there silver, and gold, and clothing, and went and hid it. Then they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried there also, and went and hid it."
12,7,9,"Then they said one to another, We aren't doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household."
12,7,10,"So they came and called to the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were."
12,7,11,"He called the porters; and they told it to the king's household within."
12,7,12,"The king arose in the night, and said to his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, 'When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.'"
12,7,13,"One of his servants answered, Please let some take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are consumed. Let us send and see."
12,7,14,"They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the army of the Syrians, saying, Go and see."
12,7,15,"They went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned, and told the king."
12,7,16,"The people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the"
12,7,17,"The king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate: and the people trod on him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him."
12,7,18,"It happened, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria;"
12,7,19,"and that captain answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the"
12,7,20,"It happened like that to him; for the people trod on him in the gate, and he died."
12,8,1,"Now Elisha had spoken to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go, you and your household, and stay for a while wherever you can; for the"
12,8,2,"The woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God. She went with her household, and lived in the land of the Philistines seven years."
12,8,3,"It happened at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines. Then she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land."
12,8,4,"Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Please tell me all the great things that Elisha has done."
12,8,5,"It happened, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him who was dead, that behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life."
12,8,6,"When the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now."
12,8,7,"Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick. It was told him, saying, The man of God has come here."
12,8,8,"The king said to Hazael, Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the"
12,8,9,"So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Your son Benhadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"
12,8,10,"Elisha said to him, Go, tell him, 'You shall surely recover;' however the"
12,8,11,"He settled his gaze steadfastly on him, until he was ashamed. Then the man of God wept."
12,8,12,"Hazael said, Why do you weep, my lord?He answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel. You will set their strongholds on fire, and you will kill their young men with the sword, and will dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child."
12,8,13,"Hazael said, But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?Elisha answered, The"
12,8,14,"Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, What did Elisha say to you?He answered, He told me that you would surely recover."
12,8,15,"It happened on the next day, that he took a thick cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died. Then Hazael reigned in his place."
12,8,16,"In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being king of Judah then, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign."
12,8,17,"He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign. He reigned eight years in Jerusalem."
12,8,18,"He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab as wife. He did that which was evil in the sight of the"
12,8,19,"However the"
12,8,20,"In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves."
12,8,21,"Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents."
12,8,22,"So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time."
12,8,23,"The rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,8,24,"Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place."
12,8,25,"In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign."
12,8,26,"Twenty-two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel."
12,8,27,"He walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of the"
12,8,28,"He went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram."
12,8,29,"King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick."
12,9,1,"Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, Put your belt on your waist, take this vial of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead."
12,9,2,"When you come there, find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner room."
12,9,3,"Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, 'Thus says the"
12,9,4,"So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead."
12,9,5,"When he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting. Then he said, I have a message for you, captain.Jehu said, To which of us all?He said, To you, O captain."
12,9,6,"He arose, and went into the house. Then he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus says the"
12,9,7,"You shall strike the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the"
12,9,8,"For the whole house of Ahab shall perish. I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel."
12,9,9,"I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah."
12,9,10,"The dogs will eat Jezebel on the plot of ground of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her.' He opened the door, and fled."
12,9,11,"Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?He said to them, You know the man and what his talk was."
12,9,12,"They said, That is a lie. Tell us now.He said, He said to me, 'Thus says the"
12,9,13,"Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, Jehu is king."
12,9,14,"So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;"
12,9,15,"but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) Jehu said, If this is your thinking, then let no one escape and go out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel."
12,9,16,"So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram."
12,9,17,"Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company.Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, 'Is it peace?'"
12,9,18,"So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'Jehu said, What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!The watchman said, The messenger came to them, but he isn't coming back."
12,9,19,"Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'Jehu answered, What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!"
12,9,20,"The watchman said, He came to them, and isn't coming back. The driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously."
12,9,21,"Joram said, Get ready!They got his chariot ready. Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite."
12,9,22,"It happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu?He answered, What peace, so long as the prostitution of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft abound?"
12,9,23,"Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treason, Ahaziah!"
12,9,24,"Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot."
12,9,25,"Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, Pick him up, and throw him in the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how, when you and I rode together after Ahab his father, the"
12,9,26,"'Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons,' says the"
12,9,27,"But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed after him, and said, Strike him also in the chariot! They struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo, and died there."
12,9,28,"His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David."
12,9,29,"In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah."
12,9,30,"When Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window."
12,9,31,"As Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Do you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?"
12,9,32,"He lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? Who?Two or three eunuchs looked out at him."
12,9,33,"He said, Throw her down!So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses. Then he trampled her under foot."
12,9,34,"When he had come in, he ate and drink; and he said, See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king's daughter."
12,9,35,"They went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands."
12,9,36,"Therefore they came back, and told him.He said, This is the word of the"
12,9,37,"and the body of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.'"
12,10,1,"Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and to those who brought up the sons of Ahab, saying,"
12,10,2,"Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor."
12,10,3,"Select the best and fittest of your master's sons, set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house."
12,10,4,"But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, the two kings did not stand before him! How then shall we stand?"
12,10,5,"He who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those who raised the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are your servants, and will do all that you ask us. We will not make any man king. You do that which is good in your eyes."
12,10,6,"Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If you are on my side, and if you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time.Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up."
12,10,7,"It happened, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and killed them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel."
12,10,8,"A messenger came, and told him, They have brought the heads of the king's sons.He said, Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning."
12,10,9,"It happened in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, You are righteous. Behold, I conspired against my master, and killed him; but who struck all these?"
12,10,10,"Know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of the"
12,10,11,"So Jehu struck all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, with all his great men, his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining."
12,10,12,"He arose and departed, and went to Samaria. As he was at the shearing house of the shepherds on the way,"
12,10,13,"Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are you?They answered, We are the brothers of Ahaziah. We are going down to greet the children of the king and the children of the queen."
12,10,14,"He said, Take them alive!They took them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing house, even forty-two men. He did not leave any of them."
12,10,15,"When he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. He greeted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?Jehonadab answered, It is.If it is, give me your hand. He gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot."
12,10,16,"He said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the"
12,10,17,"When he came to Samaria, he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of the"
12,10,18,"Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much."
12,10,19,"Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all of his worshippers, and all of his priests. Let none be absent; for I have a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is absent, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, intending that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal."
12,10,20,"Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal!They proclaimed it."
12,10,21,"Jehu sent through all Israel; and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that did not come. They came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another."
12,10,22,"He said to him who was over the vestry, Bring out robes for all the worshippers of Baal!He brought robes out to them."
12,10,23,"Jehu went with Jehonadab the son of Rechab into the house of Baal. Then he said to the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there are here with you none of the servants of the"
12,10,24,"They went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed him eighty men outside, and said, If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, he who lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him."
12,10,25,"It happened, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and kill them! Let none escape. They struck them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal."
12,10,26,"They brought out the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them."
12,10,27,"They broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine, to this day."
12,10,28,"Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel."
12,10,29,"However from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin, Jehu did not depart from after them, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan."
12,10,30,"The"
12,10,31,"But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the"
12,10,32,"In those days the"
12,10,33,"from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan."
12,10,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,10,35,"Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place."
12,10,36,"The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years."
12,11,1,"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal family."
12,11,2,"But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons who were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bedroom; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain;"
12,11,3,"He was with her hidden in the house of the"
12,11,4,"In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the"
12,11,5,"He commanded them, saying, This is the thing that you shall do: a third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king's house;"
12,11,6,"A third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard. So you shall keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier."
12,11,7,"The two companies of you, even all who go out on the Sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of the"
12,11,8,"You shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he who comes within the ranks, let him be slain. Be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in."
12,11,9,"The captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest."
12,11,10,"The priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David's, which were in the house of the"
12,11,11,"The guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king."
12,11,12,"Then he brought out the king's son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, Long live the king!"
12,11,13,"When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the house of the"
12,11,14,"and she looked, and behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the tradition was, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and cried, Treason! Treason!"
12,11,15,"Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, Bring her out between the ranks. Kill him who follows her with the sword. For the priest said, Do not let her be slain in the house of the"
12,11,16,"So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses' entry to the king's house. She was slain there."
12,11,17,"Jehoiada made a covenant between the"
12,11,18,"All the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. The priest appointed officers over the house of the"
12,11,19,"He took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the"
12,11,20,"So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the king's house."
12,11,21,"Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign."
12,12,1,"In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba."
12,12,2,"Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of the"
12,12,3,"However the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places."
12,12,4,"Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the holy things that is brought into the house of the"

12,18,30,"Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the"
12,18,31,"Do not listen to Hezekiah.' For thus says the king of Assyria, 'Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and everyone of you eat of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and everyone drink the waters of his own cistern;"
12,18,32,"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey, that you may live, and not die. Do not listen to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, The"
12,18,33,"Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?"
12,18,34,"Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?"
12,18,35,"Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the"
12,18,36,"But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king's commandment was, Do not answer him."
12,18,37,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, came with Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh."
12,19,1,"It happened, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the"
12,19,2,"He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz."
12,19,3,"They said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of trouble, of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver them."
12,19,4,"It may be the"
12,19,5,"So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah."
12,19,6,"Isaiah said to them, Thus you shall tell your master, 'Thus says the"
12,19,7,"Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.'"
12,19,8,"So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish."
12,19,9,"When he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he has come out to fight against you, he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,"
12,19,10,"'Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
12,19,11,"Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Will you be delivered?"
12,19,12,"Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?"
12,19,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?'"
12,19,14,"Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to the house of the"

12,19,16,"Incline your ear,"
12,19,17,"Truly,"
12,19,18,"and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them."
12,19,19,"Now therefore, the"
12,19,20,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says the"
12,19,21,"This is the word that the"

12,19,23,"By your messengers you have defied the Lord, and have said, 'With the multitude of my chariots, I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees; and I will enter into his farthest lodging place, the forest of his fruitful field."
12,19,24,"I have dug and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.'"
12,19,25,"Haven't you heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now have I brought it to pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps."
12,19,26,"Therefore their inhabitants were of small power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops, and like grain blasted before it has grown up."
12,19,27,"But I know your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against me."
12,19,28,"Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came."
12,19,29,"'This shall be the sign to you: You shall eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat its fruit."
12,19,30,"The remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward."

12,19,35,"It happened that night, that the angel of the"
12,19,36,"So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh."
12,19,37,"It happened, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place."
12,20,1,"In those days was Hezekiah sick to death. Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus says the"
12,20,2,"Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the"

12,20,7,"Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs.They took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered."
12,20,8,"Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the"
12,20,9,"Isaiah said, This shall be the sign to you from the"

12,20,11,"Isaiah the prophet cried to the"
12,20,12,"At that time Berodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick."
12,20,13,"Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them."
12,20,14,"Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say? From where did they come to you?Hezekiah said, They have come from a far country, even from Babylon."
12,20,15,"He said, What have they seen in your house?Hezekiah answered, They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them."
12,20,16,"Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the"
12,20,17,"'Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left,' says the"
12,20,18,"'Of your sons who shall issue from you, whom you shall father, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.'"
12,20,19,"Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The word of the"

12,20,21,"Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his place."
12,21,1,"Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Hephzibah."
12,21,2,"He did that which was evil in the sight of the"
12,21,3,"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them."
12,21,4,"He built altars in the house of the"
12,21,5,"He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of the"

12,21,16,"Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the"

12,22,11,"It happened, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his clothes."
12,22,12,"The king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,"

12,23,14,"He broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men."
12,23,15,"Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah."

12,25,7,"They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon."
12,25,8,"Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem."
12,25,9,"He burnt the house of the"

12,25,18,"The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:"
12,25,19,"and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and five men of those who saw the king's face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the city."
12,25,20,"Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah."

13,11,6,"David said, Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief."
13,11,7,"David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David."

13,11,13,"He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines."
13,11,14,"They stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the"
13,11,15,"Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim."
13,11,16,"David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem."
13,11,17,"David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!"
13,11,18,"The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the"

13,12,16,"There came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to David."
13,12,17,"David went out to meet them, and answered them, If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it."
13,12,18,"Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, We are yours, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band."

13,12,38,"All these being men of war, who could order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king."
13,12,39,"They were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brothers had made preparation for them."
13,12,40,"Moreover those who were near to them, as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, food of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and cattle, and sheep in abundance: for there was joy in Israel."
13,13,1,"David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader."
13,13,2,"David said to all the assembly of Israel, If it seems good to you, and if it is of the"

13,13,4,"All the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people."
13,13,5,"So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim."
13,13,6,"David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God the"
13,13,7,"They carried the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart."
13,13,8,"David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets."
13,13,9,"When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled."
13,13,10,"The anger of the"
13,13,11,"David was displeased, because the"
13,13,12,"David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?"
13,13,13,"So David did not move the ark to him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite."
13,13,14,"The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months: and the"
13,14,1,"Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house."
13,14,2,"David perceived that the"
13,14,3,"David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David became the father of more sons and daughters."

13,14,8,"When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them."
13,14,9,"Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim."
13,14,10,"David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?The"
13,14,11,"So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim."
13,14,12,"They left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire."
13,14,13,"The Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley."
13,14,14,"David inquired again of God; and God said to him, You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees."
13,14,15,"It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines."
13,14,16,"David did as God commanded him: and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer."
13,14,17,"The fame of David went out into all lands; and the"
13,15,1,"David made him houses in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent."
13,15,2,"Then David said, No one ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites. For the"

13,15,10,"of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve."
13,15,11,"David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,"
13,15,12,"and said to them, You are the heads of the fathers' households of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring up the ark of the"

13,15,16,"David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers, with instruments of music, stringed instruments and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy."
13,15,17,"So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;"
13,15,18,"and with them their brothers of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers."
13,15,19,"So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were given cymbals of brass to sound aloud;"
13,15,20,"and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth;"
13,15,21,"and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to lead."
13,15,22,"Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful."
13,15,23,"Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark."
13,15,24,"Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark."
13,15,25,"So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the"

13,18,3,"David struck Hadadezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates."
13,18,4,"David took from him one thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one hundred chariots."
13,18,5,"When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men."
13,18,6,"Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. The"
13,18,7,"David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem."
13,18,8,"From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much brass, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass."
13,18,9,"When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,"
13,18,10,"he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him; (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou;) and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and brass."
13,18,11,"King David also dedicated these to the"

13,18,13,"He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. The"
13,18,14,"David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness to all his people."
13,18,15,"Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;"
13,18,16,"and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;"
13,18,17,"and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king."
13,19,1,"It happened after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place."
13,19,2,"David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him."
13,19,3,"But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven't his servants come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?"
13,19,4,"So Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away."
13,19,5,"Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. He sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return."
13,19,6,"When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah."
13,19,7,"So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle."
13,19,8,"When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men."
13,19,9,"The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field."
13,19,10,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians."
13,19,11,"The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon."
13,19,12,"He said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you."
13,19,13,"Be courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God. May the"
13,19,14,"So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him."
13,19,15,"When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem."
13,19,16,"When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head."
13,19,17,"It was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came on them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him."
13,19,18,"The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the army."
13,19,19,"When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more."
13,20,1,"It happened, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, that Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it."
13,20,2,"David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set on David's head: and he brought forth the spoil of the city, a very great amount."
13,20,3,"He brought forth the people who were therein, and cut them with saws, and with iron picks, and with axes. David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."
13,20,4,"It happened after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued."
13,20,5,"There was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam."
13,20,6,"There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were twenty-four, six on each hand, and six on each foot; and he also was born to the giant."
13,20,7,"When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother killed him."
13,20,8,"These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants."
13,21,1,"Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel."
13,21,2,"David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them."
13,21,3,"Joab said, May the"
13,21,4,"Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem."
13,21,5,"Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword: and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword."
13,21,6,"But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king's word was abominable to Joab."
13,21,7,"God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel."
13,21,8,"David said to God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly."
13,21,9,"The"

13,21,21,"As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground."
13,21,22,"Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build thereon an altar to the"
13,21,23,"Ornan said to David, Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all."
13,21,24,"King David said to Ornan, No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for the"
13,21,25,"So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place."
13,21,26,"David built an altar to the"

13,22,4,"and cedar trees without number: for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David."

13,23,2,"He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites."
13,23,3,"The Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand."
13,23,4,"David said, Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of the"

13,23,10,"The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei."
13,23,11,"Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; therefore they became a fathers' house in one reckoning."
13,23,12,"The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four."
13,23,13,"The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before the"

13,29,14,"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you."
13,29,15,"For we are strangers before you, and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no remaining."

13,29,25,"The"
13,29,26,"Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel."
13,29,27,"The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem."
13,29,28,"He died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his place."
13,29,29,"Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,"
13,29,30,"with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries."
14,1,1,"Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the"
14,1,2,"Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers' households."
14,1,3,"So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the Tent of Meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the"
14,1,4,"But David had brought the ark of God up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem."
14,1,5,"Moreover the bronze altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the"
14,1,6,"Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the"
14,1,7,"In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give you."
14,1,8,"Solomon said to God, You have shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his place."
14,1,9,"Now,"
14,1,10,"Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this your people, that is so great?"
14,1,11,"God said to Solomon, Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of those who hate you, neither yet have asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king:"
14,1,12,"wisdom and knowledge is granted to you. I will give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you; neither shall there any after you have the like."
14,1,13,"So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting, to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel."
14,1,14,"Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had one thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem."
14,1,15,"The king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance."
14,1,16,"The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue; the king's merchants purchased them from Kue."
14,1,17,"They brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, they brought them out by their means."
14,2,1,"Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of the"
14,2,2,"Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them."
14,2,3,"Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As you dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell, so deal with me."
14,2,4,"Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the"
14,2,5,"The house which I build is great; for our God is great above all gods."
14,2,6,"But who is able to build him a house, since heaven and the heaven of heavens can't contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him a house, except just to burn incense before him?"
14,2,7,"Now therefore send me a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave engravings, to be with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided."
14,2,8,"Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon: and behold, my servants shall be with your servants,"
14,2,9,"even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful."
14,2,10,"Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil."
14,2,11,"Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the"
14,2,12,"Huram continued, Blessed be the"
14,2,13,"Now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, of Huram my father's,"
14,2,14,"the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any kind of engraving, and to execute any design; that there may be a place appointed to him with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David your father."
14,2,15,"Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants:"
14,2,16,"and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need; and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem."
14,2,17,"Solomon numbered all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred."
14,2,18,"He set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people at work."
14,3,1,"Then Solomon began to build the house of the"
14,3,2,"He began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign."
14,3,3,"Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God's house. The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits."
14,3,4,"The porch that was in front, its length, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold."
14,3,5,"The greater house he made a ceiling with fir wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains."
14,3,6,"He garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim."
14,3,7,"He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and its walls, and its doors, with gold; and engraved cherubim on the walls."
14,3,8,"He made the most holy house: its length, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents."
14,3,9,"The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He overlaid the upper rooms with gold."
14,3,10,"In the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold."
14,3,11,"The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub."
14,3,12,"The wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, joining to the wing of the other cherub."
14,3,13,"The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house."
14,3,14,"He made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and ornamented it with cherubim."
14,3,15,"Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits."
14,3,16,"He made chains in the oracle, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains."
14,3,17,"He set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz."
14,4,1,"Then he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits its length, and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height."
14,4,2,"Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass; and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it."
14,4,3,"Under it was the likeness of oxen, which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast."
14,4,4,"It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward."
14,4,5,"It was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths."
14,4,6,"He made also ten basins, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in."
14,4,7,"He made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left."
14,4,8,"He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. He made one hundred basins of gold."
14,4,9,"Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with brass."
14,4,10,"He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south."
14,4,11,"Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God's house:"
14,4,12,"the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,"
14,4,13,"and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars."
14,4,14,"He made also the bases, and the basins made he on the bases;"
14,4,15,"one sea, and the twelve oxen under it."
14,4,16,"Huram his father also made the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all its vessels for king Solomon for the house of the"
14,4,17,"The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah."
14,4,18,"Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out."
14,4,19,"Solomon made all the vessels that were in God's house, the golden altar also, and the tables with the show bread on them;"
14,4,20,"and the lampstands with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;"
14,4,21,"and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold;"
14,4,22,"and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of the house, the inner doors of it for the most holy place, and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold."
14,5,1,"Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of the"

14,5,3,"And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month."
14,5,4,"All the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;"
14,5,5,"and they brought up the ark, and the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these the priests the Levites brought up."
14,5,6,"King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude."
14,5,7,"The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the"
14,5,8,"For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above."
14,5,9,"The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there it is to this day."
14,5,10,"There was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses put at Horeb, when the"
14,5,11,"It happened, when the priests had come out of the holy place, (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their divisions;"
14,5,12,"also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets;)"
14,5,13,"it happened, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the"
14,5,14,"so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the"
14,6,1,"Then Solomon said, The"
14,6,2,"But I have built you a house of habitation, and a place for you to dwell in forever."
14,6,3,"The king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood."
14,6,4,"He said, Blessed be the"
14,6,5,"'Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; nor did I choose any man to be the leader over my people Israel:"
14,6,6,"but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.'"
14,6,7,"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the"

14,6,14,"and he said, "
14,6,15,"who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him: yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day."

14,6,22,"If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before your altar in this house;"

14,6,26,"When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them:"
14,6,27,"then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance."
14,6,28,"If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is;"

14,6,30,"then hear from heaven, your dwelling place and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts of the children of men;)"
14,6,31,"that they may fear you, to walk in your ways, so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers."
14,6,32,"Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for your great name's sake, and your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house:"
14,6,33,"then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, and fear you, as does your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name."
14,6,34,"If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name;"
14,6,35,"then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
14,6,36,"If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn't sin), and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near;"
14,6,37,"yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of their captivity, saying, 'We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;'"
14,6,38,"if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, and the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name:"
14,6,39,"then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place, their prayer and their petitions, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you."
14,6,40,"Now, my God, let, I beg you, your eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place."

14,8,3,"Solomon went to Hamath Zobah, and prevailed against it."
14,8,4,"He built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities, which he built in Hamath."
14,8,5,"Also he built Beth Horon the upper, and Beth Horon the lower, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;"
14,8,6,"and Baalath, and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion."
14,8,7,"As for all the people who were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel;"
14,8,8,"of their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel did not consume, of them Solomon conscripted forced labor to this day."
14,8,9,"But of the children of Israel, Solomon made no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen."
14,8,10,"These were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two-hundred fifty, who ruled over the people."
14,8,11,"Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house that he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places where the ark of the"

14,8,14,"He appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their divisions at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded."
14,8,15,"They did not depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures."
14,8,16,"Now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of the"
14,8,17,"Then went Solomon to Ezion Geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom."
14,8,18,"Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from there four hundred fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon."
14,9,1,"When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bore spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she had come to Solomon, she talked with him of all that was in her heart."
14,9,2,"Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything hidden from Solomon which he did not tell her."
14,9,3,"When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,"

14,9,6,"However I did not believe their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it; and behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me: you exceed the fame that I heard."
14,9,7,"Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, and hear your wisdom."
14,9,8,"Blessed be the"
14,9,9,"She gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon."
14,9,10,"The servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones."
14,9,11,"The king made of the algum trees terraces for the house of the"
14,9,12,"King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants."
14,9,13,"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,"
14,9,14,"besides that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon."
14,9,15,"King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one buckler."
14,9,16,"He made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon."
14,9,17,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold."
14,9,18,"And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays."
14,9,19,"Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was nothing like it made in any kingdom."
14,9,20,"All king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon."
14,9,21,"For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks."
14,9,22,"So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom."
14,9,23,"All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart."
14,9,24,"They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year."
14,9,25,"Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he stationed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem."
14,9,26,"He ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt."
14,9,27,"The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance."
14,9,28,"They brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands."
14,9,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, aren't they written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?"
14,9,30,"Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years."
14,9,31,"Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place."
14,10,1,"Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king."
14,10,2,"It happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon), that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt."
14,10,3,"They sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,"
14,10,4,"Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you."
14,10,5,"He said to them, Come again to me after three days.The people departed."
14,10,6,"King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people?"
14,10,7,"They spoke to him, saying, If you are kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever."
14,10,8,"But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him."
14,10,9,"He said to them, What counsel do you give, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, 'Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?'"
14,10,10,"The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you, saying, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter on us;' thus you shall say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist."
14,10,11,"Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.'"
14,10,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, Come to me again the third day."
14,10,13,"The king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,"
14,10,14,"and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."
14,10,15,"So the king did not listen to the people; for it was brought about of God, that the"
14,10,16,"When all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David. So all Israel departed to their tents."
14,10,17,"But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them."
14,10,18,"Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get himself up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem."
14,10,19,"So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day."
14,11,1,"When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam."
14,11,2,"But the word of the"
14,11,3,"Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,"
14,11,4,"'Thus says the"
14,11,5,"Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah."
14,11,6,"He built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,"
14,11,7,"Beth Zur, and Soco, and Adullam,"
14,11,8,"and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,"
14,11,9,"and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,"
14,11,10,"and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities."
14,11,11,"He fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, and oil and wine."
14,11,12,"He put shields and spears in every city, and made them exceeding strong. Judah and Benjamin belonged to him."
14,11,13,"The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border."
14,11,14,"For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest's office to the"
14,11,15,"and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the male goats, and for the calves which he had made."
14,11,16,"After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek the"
14,11,17,"So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon."
14,11,18,"Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;"
14,11,19,"and she bore him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham."
14,11,20,"After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith."
14,11,21,"Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and sixty concubines, and became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.)"
14,11,22,"Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, the prince among his brothers; for he intended to make him king."
14,11,23,"He dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city: and he gave them food in abundance. He sought for them many wives."
14,12,1,"It happened, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of the"
14,12,2,"It happened in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against the"
14,12,3,"with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen. The people were without number who came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians."
14,12,4,"He took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem."
14,12,5,"Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus says the"
14,12,6,"Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The"
14,12,7,"When the"
14,12,8,"Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries."
14,12,9,"So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the"
14,12,10,"King Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house."

14,12,15,"Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, aren't they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the way of genealogies? There were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually."
14,12,16,"Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his place."
14,13,1,"In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah."
14,13,2,"He reigned three years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam."
14,13,3,"Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor."
14,13,4,"Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:"
14,13,5,"Ought you not to know that the"
14,13,6,"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord."
14,13,7,"There were gathered to him worthless men, base fellows, who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them."
14,13,8,"Now you think to withstand the kingdom of the"
14,13,9,"Haven't you driven out the priests of the"
14,13,10,"But as for us, the"
14,13,11,"and they burn to the"

14,13,13,"But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them."
14,13,14,"When Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to the"
14,13,15,"Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it happened, that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah."
14,13,16,"The children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand."
14,13,17,"Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men."
14,13,18,"Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on the"
14,13,19,"Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with its towns, and Jeshanah with its towns, and Ephron with its towns."
14,13,20,"Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah. The"
14,13,21,"But Abijah grew mighty, and took to himself fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters."
14,13,22,"The rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo."
14,14,1,"So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet ten years."
14,14,2,"Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the"
14,14,3,"for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and cut down the Asherim,"
14,14,4,"and commanded Judah to seek the"

14,14,8,"Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred eighty thousand: all these were mighty men of valor."
14,14,9,"There came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops, and three hundred chariots; and he came to Mareshah."
14,14,10,"Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah."
14,14,11,"Asa cried to the"
14,14,12,"So the"
14,14,13,"Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the"
14,14,14,"They struck all the cities around Gerar; for the fear of the"
14,14,15,"They struck also the tents of livestock, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem."
14,15,1,"The Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded:"
14,15,2,"and he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin! The"
14,15,3,"Now for a long time Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law."
14,15,4,"But when in their distress they turned to the"
14,15,5,"In those times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands."
14,15,6,"They were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God troubled them with all adversity."
14,15,7,"But you be strong, and do not let your hands be slack; for your work shall be rewarded."
14,15,8,"When Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of the"

14,15,17,"But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days."
14,15,18,"He brought into God's house the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels."
14,15,19,"There was no more war to the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa."
14,16,1,"In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah."
14,16,2,"Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the"
14,16,3,"Let there be a treaty between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me."
14,16,4,"Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali."
14,16,5,"It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease."
14,16,6,"Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah."
14,16,7,"At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on the"

14,16,12,"In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he did not seek the"
14,16,13,"Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign."
14,16,14,"They buried him in his own tombs, which he had dug out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers' art: and they made a very great burning for him."
14,17,1,"Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel."
14,17,2,"He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken."

14,17,12,"Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store."
14,17,13,"He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem."
14,17,14,"This was the numbering of them according to their fathers' houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand;"
14,17,15,"and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand;"
14,17,16,"and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to the"

14,17,19,"These were those who waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah."
14,18,1,"Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he joined affinity with Ahab."
14,18,2,"After certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and for the people who were with him, and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead."
14,18,3,"Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilead?He answered him, I am as you are, and my people as your people. We will be with you in the war."
14,18,4,"Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire first for the word of the"
14,18,5,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?They said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king."
14,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophet of the"

14,18,9,"Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them."
14,18,10,"Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus says the"

14,18,29,"The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle."
14,18,30,"Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel."
14,18,31,"It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel! Therefore they turned around to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and the"
14,18,32,"It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him."
14,18,33,"A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the army; for I am severely wounded."
14,18,34,"The battle increased that day. However the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening; and about the time of the going down of the sun, he died."

14,20,25,"When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much."
14,20,26,"On the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed the"

14,20,35,"After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. The same did very wickedly:"
14,20,36,"and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion Geber."

14,22,1,"The inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place; for the band of men who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned."
14,22,2,"Forty-two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri."
14,22,3,"He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly."
14,22,4,"He did that which was evil in the sight of the"

14,22,11,"But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she did not kill him."
14,22,12,"He was with them hidden in God's house six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land."

14,23,8,"So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath; with those who were to go out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss the shift."

Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and said, Treason! Treason!"
14,23,14,"Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, Bring her out between the ranks; and whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Do not kill her in the"

Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance."
14,24,12,"The king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the"

14,24,23,"It happened at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus."
14,24,24,"For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and the"
14,24,25,"When they were departed for him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings."
14,24,26,"These are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess."
14,24,27,"Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid on him, and the rebuilding of God's house, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. Amaziah his son reigned in his place."
14,25,1,"Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem."
14,25,2,"He did that which was right in the eyes of the"
14,25,3,"Now it happened, when the kingdom was established to him, that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father."
14,25,4,"But he did not put their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as the"
14,25,5,"Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers' houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, who could handle spear and shield."
14,25,6,"He hired also one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver."
14,25,7,"A man of God came to him, saying, O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you; for the"
14,25,8,"But if you will go, take action, be strong for the battle. God will overthrow you before the enemy; for God has power to help, and to overthrow."
14,25,9,"Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?The man of God answered, The"
14,25,10,"Then Amaziah separated them, the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger."
14,25,11,"Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir."
14,25,12,"The children of Judah carry away ten thousand alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and threw them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces."
14,25,13,"But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth Horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much spoil."
14,25,14,"Now it happened, after that Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them."
14,25,15,"Therefore the anger of the"
14,25,16,"It happened, as he talked with him, that the king said to him, Have we made you one of the king's counselors? Stop! Why should you be struck down?Then the prophet stopped, and said, I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this, and have not listened to my counsel."
14,25,17,"Then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face."
14,25,18,"Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son as his wife; then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and trampled down the thistle."
14,25,19,"You say to yourself that you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast. Now stay at home. Why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?'"
14,25,20,"But Amaziah would not listen; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom."
14,25,21,"So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah."
14,25,22,"Judah was defeated by Israel; and they fled every man to his tent."
14,25,23,"Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits."
14,25,24,"He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in God's house with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria."
14,25,25,"Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years."
14,25,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, aren't they written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?"
14,25,27,"Now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following the"
14,25,28,"They brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah."
14,26,1,"All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah."
14,26,2,"He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers."
14,26,3,"Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem."
14,26,4,"He did that which was right in the eyes of the"
14,26,5,"He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God: and as long as he sought the"
14,26,6,"He went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod, and among the Philistines."
14,26,7,"God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal, and the Meunim."
14,26,8,"The Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he grew exceeding strong."
14,26,9,"Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them."
14,26,10,"He built towers in the wilderness, and dug out many cisterns, for he had much livestock; in the lowland also, and in the plain: and he had farmers and vineyard keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved farming."
14,26,11,"Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, who went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains."
14,26,12,"The whole number of the heads of fathers' households, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and six hundred."
14,26,13,"Under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, who made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy."
14,26,14,"Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging."
14,26,15,"He made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and on the battlements, with which to shoot arrows and great stones. His name spread far abroad; for he was marvelously helped, until he was strong."
14,26,16,"But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against the"
14,26,17,"Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of the"
14,26,18,"and they resisted Uzziah the king, and said to him, It isn't for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the"
14,26,19,"Then Uzziah was angry; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was angry with the priests, the leprosy broke forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of the"
14,26,20,"Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked on him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from there; yes, himself hurried also to go out, because the"
14,26,21,"Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the"
14,26,22,"Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote."
14,26,23,"So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper. Jotham his son reigned in his place."
14,27,1,"Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok."
14,27,2,"He did that which was right in the eyes of the"
14,27,3,"He built the upper gate of the house of the"
14,27,4,"Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers."
14,27,5,"He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. The children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The children of Ammon gave that much to him in the second year also, and in the third."
14,27,6,"So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before the"
14,27,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah."
14,27,8,"He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem."
14,27,9,"Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his place."
14,28,1,"Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not do that which was right in the eyes of the"
14,28,2,"but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baals."
14,28,3,"Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the"
14,28,4,"He sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree."
14,28,5,"Therefore the"
14,28,6,"For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken the"
14,28,7,"Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah who was next to the king."
14,28,8,"The children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria."
14,28,9,"But a prophet of the"
14,28,10,"Now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondservants and bondmaids for yourselves. Aren't there even with you trespasses of your own against the"
14,28,11,"Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that you have taken captive from your brothers; for the fierce wrath of the"
14,28,12,"Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,"
14,28,13,"and said to them, You shall not bring in the captives here: for you purpose that which will bring on us a trespass against the"
14,28,14,"So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly."
14,28,15,"The men who have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all who were naked among them, dressed them, gave them sandals, and gave them something to eat and to drink, anointed them, carried all the feeble of them on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria."
14,28,16,"At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him."
14,28,17,"For again the Edomites had come and struck Judah, and carried away captives."
14,28,18,"The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the Negev of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with its towns, and Timnah with its towns, Gimzo also and its towns: and they lived there."
14,28,19,"For the"
14,28,20,"Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but did not strengthen him."
14,28,21,"For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the"
14,28,22,"In the time of his distress, he trespassed yet more against the"
14,28,23,"For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which struck him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, so I will sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel."
14,28,24,"Ahaz gathered together the vessels of God's house, and cut in pieces the vessels of God's house, and shut up the doors of the house of the"
14,28,25,"In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger the"
14,28,26,"Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
14,28,27,"Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place."
14,29,1,"Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah."
14,29,2,"He did that which was right in the eyes of the"
14,29,3,"He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the"
14,29,4,"He brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,"
14,29,5,"and said to them, Listen to me, you Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of the"
14,29,6,"For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of the"

14,29,8,"Therefore the wrath of the"

14,29,10,"Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the"
14,29,11,"My sons, do not be negligent now; for the"
14,29,12,"Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;"

14,29,14,"and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel."
14,29,15,"They gathered their brothers, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of the"

14,29,20,"Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of the"
14,29,21,"They brought seven bulls, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven male goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. He commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the"
14,29,22,"So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the altar."
14,29,23,"They brought near the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands on them:"
14,29,24,"and the priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel."
14,29,25,"He set the Levites in the house of the"
14,29,26,"The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets."
14,29,27,"Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of the"
14,29,28,"All the assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished."
14,29,29,"When they had made an end of offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped."
14,29,30,"Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to the"
14,29,31,"Then Hezekiah answered, Now you have consecrated yourselves to the"
14,29,32,"The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the"
14,29,33,"The consecrated things were six hundred head of cattle and three thousand sheep."
14,29,34,"But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: therefore their brothers the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests."
14,29,35,"Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the"
14,29,36,"Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly."
14,30,1,"Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the"
14,30,2,"For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the Passover in the second month."
14,30,3,"For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem."
14,30,4,"The thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly."
14,30,5,"So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to the"
14,30,6,"So the couriers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, You children of Israel, turn again to the"

14,30,10,"So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun: but they ridiculed them, and mocked them."
14,30,11,"Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem."
14,30,12,"Also on Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the"
14,30,13,"Many people assembled at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly."
14,30,14,"They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron."
14,30,15,"Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the house of the"
14,30,16,"They stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites."

14,30,18,"For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, May the good"
14,30,19,"who sets his heart to seek God, the"

14,30,21,"The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the"
14,30,22,"Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of the"
14,30,23,"The whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept another seven days with gladness."
14,30,24,"For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves."
14,30,25,"All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Israel, and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel, and who lived in Judah, rejoiced."
14,30,26,"So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem."
14,30,27,"Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven."
14,31,1,"Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities."
14,31,2,"Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of the"
14,31,3,"He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the"

14,31,5,"As soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly."
14,31,6,"The children of Israel and Judah, who lived in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to the"

14,31,8,"When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the"
14,31,9,"Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps."
14,31,10,"Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since people began to bring the offerings into the house of the"

14,31,13,"Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of God's house."
14,31,14,"Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east gate, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the offerings of the"
14,31,15,"Under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brothers by divisions, as well to the great as to the small:"
14,31,16,"besides those who were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone who entered into the house of the"

14,31,18,"and those who were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness."
14,31,19,"Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all who were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites."
14,31,20,"Hezekiah did so throughout all Judah; and he worked that which was good and right and faithful before the"
14,31,21,"In every work that he began in the service of God's house, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered."
14,32,1,"After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself."
14,32,2,"When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,"
14,32,3,"he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city; and they helped him."
14,32,4,"So many people gathered together, and they stopped all the springs, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?"
14,32,5,"He took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance."
14,32,6,"He set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spoke comfortably to them, saying,"
14,32,7,"Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude who is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him."
14,32,8,"With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the"
14,32,9,"After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying,"
14,32,10,"Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, In whom do you trust, that you remain under siege in Jerusalem?"
14,32,11,"Doesn't Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, 'The"
14,32,12,"Hasn't the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, 'You shall worship before one altar, and on it you shall burn incense?'"
14,32,13,"Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand?"
14,32,14,"Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?"
14,32,15,"Now therefore do not let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this way, neither believe him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand?"
14,32,16,"His servants spoke yet more against the"
14,32,17,"He also wrote letters insulting the"
14,32,18,"They cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city."
14,32,19,"They spoke of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's hands."
14,32,20,"Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven."
14,32,21,"The"
14,32,22,"Thus the"

14,32,25,"But Hezekiah did not render again according to the benefit done to him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath on him, and on Judah and Jerusalem."
14,32,26,"Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the"
14,32,27,"Hezekiah had a very great amount of riches and honor: and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all kinds of goodly vessels;"
14,32,28,"storehouses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all kinds of animals, and flocks in folds."
14,32,29,"Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance."
14,32,30,"This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. Hezekiah prospered in all his works."
14,32,31,"However concerning the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart."
14,32,32,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
14,32,33,"Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. Manasseh his son reigned in his place."
14,33,1,"Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem."
14,33,2,"He did that which was evil in the sight of the"
14,33,3,"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baals, and made Asheroth, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them."
14,33,4,"He built altars in the house of the"
14,33,5,"He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of the"

14,33,8,"neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances given by Moses."

14,33,14,"Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he encircled Ophel with it, and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah."
14,33,15,"He took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of the"
14,33,16,"He built up the altar of the"
14,33,17,"Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only to the"

14,33,19,"His prayer also, and how God was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the engraved images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai."
14,33,20,"So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his place."
14,33,21,"Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem."
14,33,22,"He did that which was evil in the sight of the"
14,33,23,"He did not humble himself before the"
14,33,24,"His servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house."
14,33,25,"But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place."
14,34,1,"Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem."
14,34,2,"He did that which was right in the eyes of the"
14,34,3,"For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the engraved images, and the molten images."
14,34,4,"They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; and the incense altars that were on high above them he cut down; and the Asherim, and the engraved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them."
14,34,5,"He burnt the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem."
14,34,6,"He did this in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even to Naphtali, around in their ruins."
14,34,7,"He broke down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the engraved images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem."
14,34,8,"Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the"
14,34,9,"They came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into God's house, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
14,34,10,"They delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the"
14,34,11,"even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy cut stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed."
14,34,12,"The men did the work faithfully: and their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and others of the Levites, all who were skillful with instruments of music."
14,34,13,"Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all who did the work in every kind of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters."
14,34,14,"When they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the"
14,34,15,"Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the"
14,34,16,"Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to your servants, they are doing."
14,34,17,"They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the"
14,34,18,"Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. Shaphan read therein before the king."
14,34,19,"It happened, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he tore his clothes."
14,34,20,"The king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,"
14,34,21,"Go inquire of the"
14,34,22,"So Hilkiah, and they whom the king had commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spoke to her to that effect."
14,34,23,"She said to them, Thus says the"
14,34,24,"Thus says the"
14,34,25,"Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out on this place, and it shall not be quenched.''"
14,34,26,"But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the"
14,34,27,"because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God, when you heard his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself before me, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, says the"
14,34,28,"Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the disaster that I will bring on this place, and on its inhabitants.'They brought back word to the king."
14,34,29,"Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem."
14,34,30,"The king went up to the house of the"
14,34,31,"The king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the"
14,34,32,"He caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers."
14,34,33,"Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve the"
14,35,1,"Josiah kept a Passover to the"

14,35,5,"Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of your brothers the children of the people, and let there be for each a portion of a fathers' house of the Levites."
14,35,6,"Kill the Passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to the word of the"
14,35,7,"Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and young goats, all of them for the Passover offerings, to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls: these were of the king's substance."
14,35,8,"His princes gave for a freewill offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of God's house, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small livestock, and three hundred head of cattle."
14,35,9,"Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small livestock, and five hundred head of cattle."
14,35,10,"So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the king's commandment."
14,35,11,"They killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of their hand, and the Levites flayed them."
14,35,12,"They removed the burnt offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers' houses of the children of the people, to offer to the"
14,35,13,"They roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people."
14,35,14,"Afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron."
14,35,15,"The singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters were at every gate: they did not need to depart from their service; for their brothers the Levites prepared for them."
14,35,16,"So all the service of the"
14,35,17,"The children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days."
14,35,18,"There was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
14,35,19,"In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept."
14,35,20,"After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him."
14,35,21,"But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not against you this day, but against the house with which I have war. God has commanded me to make haste. Beware that it is God who is with me, that he not destroy you."
14,35,22,"Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo."
14,35,23,"The archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Take me away, because I am seriously wounded!"
14,35,24,"So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah."
14,35,25,"Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and behold, they are written in the lamentations."
14,35,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of the"
14,35,27,"and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah."
14,36,1,"Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's place in Jerusalem."
14,36,2,"Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem."
14,36,3,"The king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold."
14,36,4,"The king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt."
14,36,5,"Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the"

14,36,18,"All the vessels of God's house, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the"
14,36,19,"They burnt God's house, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels of it."
14,36,20,"He carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:"
14,36,21,"to fulfill the word of the"

15,2,64,"The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred sixty,"
15,2,65,"besides their male servants and their female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven: and they had two hundred singing men and singing women."
15,2,66,"Their horses were seven hundred thirty-six; their mules, two hundred forty-five;"
15,2,67,"their camels, four hundred thirty-five; their donkeys, six thousand seven hundred and twenty."
15,2,68,"Some of the heads of fathers' households, when they came to the house of the"
15,2,69,"they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work sixty-one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priests' garments."
15,2,70,"So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities."
15,3,1,"When the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem."
15,3,2,"Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak stood up with his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God."
15,3,3,"In spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands, they set the altar on its base; and they offered burnt offerings on it to the"
15,3,4,"They kept the feast of tents, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;"
15,3,5,"and afterward the continual burnt offering, the offerings of the new moons, of all the set feasts of the"
15,3,6,"From the first day of the seventh month, they began to offer burnt offerings to the"
15,3,7,"They also gave money to the masons, and to the carpenters. They also gave food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant that they had from Cyrus King of Persia."
15,3,8,"Now in the second year of their coming to God's house at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began the work and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the"
15,3,9,"Then Jeshua stood with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in God's house: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brothers the Levites."
15,3,10,"When the builders laid the foundation of the"
15,3,11,"They sang to one another in praising and giving thanks to the"
15,3,12,"But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' households, the old men who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice. Many also shouted aloud for joy,"
15,3,13,"so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard far away."
15,4,1,"Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple to the"
15,4,2,"then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers' households, and said to them, Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as you do; and we sacrifice to him since the days of Esar Haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here."
15,4,3,"But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers' households of Israel, said to them, You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to the"
15,4,4,"Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,"
15,4,5,"and hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia."
15,4,6,"In the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem."
15,4,7,"In the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in Syrian, and set forth in the Syrian language."
15,4,8,"Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:"
15,4,9,"then Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,"
15,4,10,"and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River, and so forth, wrote."
15,4,11,"This is the copy of the letter that they sent to Artaxerxes the king: Your servants the men beyond the River, and so forth."
15,4,12,"Be it known to the king, that the Jews who came up from you have come to us to Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations."
15,4,13,"Be it known now to the king that if this city is built, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings."
15,4,14,"Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not appropriate for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and informed the king;"
15,4,15,"that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers: so you shall find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste."
15,4,16,"We inform the king that, if this city be built, and the walls finished, by this means you shall have no portion beyond the River."
15,4,17,"Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria, and in the rest of the country beyond the River: Peace, and so forth."
15,4,18,"The letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me."
15,4,19,"I decreed, and search has been made, and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein."
15,4,20,"There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid to them."
15,4,21,"Make a decree now to cause these men to cease, and that this city not be built, until a decree shall be made by me."
15,4,22,"Take heed that you not be slack herein: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?"
15,4,23,"Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power."
15,4,24,"Then ceased the work of God's house which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia."
15,5,1,"Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel they prophesied to them."
15,5,2,"Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build God's house which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them."
15,5,3,"At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shetharbozenai, and their companions, and said thus to them, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?"
15,5,4,"Then we told them in this way, what the names of the men were who were making this building."
15,5,5,"But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, until the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it."
15,5,6,"The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shetharbozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king;"
15,5,7,"they sent a letter to him, in which was written thus: To Darius the king, all peace."
15,5,8,"Be it known to the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls; and this work goes on with diligence and prospers in their hands."
15,5,9,"Then we asked those elders, and said to them thus, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?"
15,5,10,"We asked them their names also, to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were at their head."
15,5,11,"Thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished."
15,5,12,"But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon."
15,5,13,"But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God."
15,5,14,"The gold and silver vessels also of God's house, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;"
15,5,15,"and he said to him, 'Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let God's house be built in its place.'"
15,5,16,"Then the same Sheshbazzar came, and laid the foundations of God's house which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now has it been in building, and yet it is not completed."
15,5,17,"Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let a search be made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter."
15,6,1,"Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon."
15,6,2,"There was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a scroll, and therein was thus written for a record:"
15,6,3,"In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning God's house at Jerusalem, let the house be built, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let its foundations be strongly laid; its height sixty cubits, and its breadth sixty cubits;"
15,6,4,"with three courses of great stones, and a course of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house."
15,6,5,"Also let the gold and silver vessels of God's house, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and brought again to the temple which is at Jerusalem, everyone to its place; and you shall put them in God's house."
15,6,6,"Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the River, you must stay far from there."
15,6,7,"Leave the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place."
15,6,8,"Moreover I make a decree what you shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses be given with all diligence to these men, that they be not hindered."
15,6,9,"That which they have need of, both young bulls, and rams, and lambs, for burnt offerings to the God of heaven; also wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail;"
15,6,10,"that they may offer sacrifices of pleasant aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons."
15,6,11,"Also I have made a decree, that whoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this:"
15,6,12,"and the God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples who shall put forth their hand to alter the same, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with all diligence."
15,6,13,"Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and their companions, because Darius the king had sent a decree, did accordingly with all diligence."
15,6,14,"The elders of the Jews built and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. They built and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia."
15,6,15,"This house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king."
15,6,16,"The children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy."
15,6,17,"They offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel."
15,6,18,"They set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses."
15,6,19,"The children of the captivity kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month."
15,6,20,"For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure: and they killed the Passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brothers the priests, and for themselves."
15,6,21,"The children of Israel who had come again out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek the"
15,6,22,"and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the"
15,7,1,"Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,"
15,7,2,"the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,"
15,7,3,"the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,"
15,7,4,"the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,"
15,7,5,"the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest;"
15,7,6,"this Ezra went up from Babylon: and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the"

15,7,8,"He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king."
15,7,9,"For on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him."
15,7,10,"For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of the"
15,7,11,"Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of the"
15,7,12,"Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect and so forth."
15,7,13,"I make a decree, that all those of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with you."
15,7,14,"Because you are sent of the king and his seven counselors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of your God which is in your hand,"
15,7,15,"and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,"
15,7,16,"and all the silver and gold that you shall find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;"
15,7,17,"therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bulls, rams, lambs, with their meal offerings and their drink offerings, and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem."
15,7,18,"Whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do that after the will of your God."
15,7,19,"The vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver before the God of Jerusalem."
15,7,20,"Whatever more shall be needful for the house of your God, which you shall have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house."
15,7,21,"I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done with all diligence,"
15,7,22,"to one hundred talents of silver, and to one hundred measures of wheat, and to one hundred baths of wine, and to one hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much."
15,7,23,"Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?"
15,7,24,"Also we inform you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, on them."
15,7,25,"You, Ezra, after the wisdom of your God who is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people who are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of your God; and teach him who doesn't know them."
15,7,26,"Whoever will not do the law of your God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed on him with all diligence, whether it be to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment."

15,8,3,"Of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males one hundred fifty."
15,8,4,"Of the sons of Pahathmoab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah; and with him two hundred males."
15,8,5,"Of the sons of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel; and with him three hundred males."

15,8,9,"Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel; and with him two hundred and eighteen males."
15,8,10,"Of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him one hundred sixty males."
15,8,11,"Of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai; and with him twenty-eight males."
15,8,12,"Of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan; and with him one hundred ten males."
15,8,13,"Of the sons of Adonikam, who were the last; and these are their names: Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah; and with them sixty males."
15,8,14,"Of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud; and with them seventy males."
15,8,15,"I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi."
15,8,16,"Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers."
15,8,17,"I sent them forth to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should tell Iddo, and his brothers the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God."
15,8,18,"According to the good hand of our God on us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brothers, eighteen;"
15,8,19,"and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty;"
15,8,20,"and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were mentioned by name."
15,8,21,"Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance."
15,8,22,"For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is on all those who seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all those who forsake him."
15,8,23,"So we fasted and begged our God for this: and he was entreated of us."
15,8,24,"Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,"
15,8,25,"and weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered:"
15,8,26,"I weighed into their hand six hundred fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels one hundred talents; of gold one hundred talents;"
15,8,27,"and twenty bowls of gold, of one thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold."
15,8,28,"I said to them, You are holy to the"
15,8,29,"Watch, and keep them, until you weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers' households of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the rooms of the house of the"
15,8,30,"So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God."
15,8,31,"Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the bandit by the way."
15,8,32,"We came to Jerusalem, and stayed there three days."
15,8,33,"On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite;"
15,8,34,"the whole by number and by weight: and all the weight was written at that time."
15,8,35,"The children of the captivity, who had come out of exile, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering to the"
15,8,36,"They delivered the king's commissions to the king's satraps, and to the governors beyond the River: and they furthered the people and God's house."
15,9,1,"Now when these things were done, the princes drew near to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, following their abominations, even those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites."
15,9,2,"For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands. Yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass."
15,9,3,"When I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded."
15,9,4,"Then were assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of their trespass of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening offering."
15,9,5,"At the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn; and I fell on my knees, and spread out my hands to the"
15,9,6,"and I said, My God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you, my God; for our iniquities have increased over our head, and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens."
15,9,7,"Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty to this day; and for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests, have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to confusion of face, as it is this day."
15,9,8,"Now for a little moment grace has been shown from the"
15,9,9,"For we are bondservants; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended loving kindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem."
15,9,10,"Now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments,"
15,9,11,"which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, 'The land, to which you go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness."
15,9,12,"Now therefore do not give your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity forever; that you may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever.'"
15,9,13,"After all that has come on us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, since you, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us such a remnant,"
15,9,14,"shall we again break your commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? Wouldn't you be angry with us until you had consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?"
15,9,15,"The"
15,10,1,"Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before God's house, there was gathered together to him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very bitterly."
15,10,2,"Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land. Yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing."
15,10,3,"Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God. Let it be done according to the law."
15,10,4,"Arise; for the matter belongs to you, and we are with you. Be courageous, and do it."
15,10,5,"Then Ezra arose, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they swore."
15,10,6,"Then Ezra rose up from before God's house, and went into the room of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came there, he ate no bread, nor drank water; for he mourned because of their trespass of the captivity."
15,10,7,"They made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem;"
15,10,8,"and that whoever did not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity."
15,10,9,"Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month: and all the people sat in the broad place before God's house, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain."
15,10,10,"Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, You have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel."
15,10,11,"Now therefore make confession to the"
15,10,12,"Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, As you have said concerning us, so must we do."
15,10,13,"But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand outside; neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter."
15,10,14,"Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all those who are in our cities who have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter is resolved."
15,10,15,"Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them."
15,10,16,"The children of the captivity did so. Ezra the priest, with certain heads of fathers' households, after their fathers' houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter."
15,10,17,"They made an end with all the men who had married foreign women by the first day of the first month."
15,10,18,"Among the sons of the priests there were found who had married foreign women: of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brothers, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah."
15,10,19,"They gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt."
15,10,20,"Of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah."
15,10,21,"Of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah."
15,10,22,"Of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah."

15,10,44,"All these had taken foreign wives; and some of them had wives by whom they had children."
16,1,1,"The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it happened in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,"
16,1,2,"that Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem."
16,1,3,"They said to me, The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire."
16,1,4,"It happened, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,"
16,1,5,"and said, I beg you,"
16,1,6,"Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father's house have sinned."
16,1,7,"We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your servant Moses."
16,1,8,"Remember, I beg you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, 'If you trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples;"
16,1,9,"but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.'"
16,1,10,"Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand."
16,1,11,"Lord, I beg you, let your ear be attentive now to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who delight to fear your name; and please prosper your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.Now I was cup bearer to the king."
16,2,1,"It happened in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad before in his presence."
16,2,2,"The king said to me, Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart.Then I was very much afraid."
16,2,3,"I said to the king, Let the king live forever! Why shouldn't my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' tombs, lies waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?"
16,2,4,"Then the king said to me, For what do you make request?So I prayed to the God of heaven."
16,2,5,"I said to the king, If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, that I may build it."
16,2,6,"The king said to me (the queen was also sitting by him), For how long shall your journey be? And when will you return?So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time."
16,2,7,"Moreover I said to the king, If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah;"
16,2,8,"and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple, for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into.The king granted my requests, because of the good hand of my God on me."
16,2,9,"Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen."
16,2,10,"When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel."
16,2,11,"So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days."
16,2,12,"I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any animal with me, except the animal that I rode on."
16,2,13,"I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal's well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and its gates were consumed with fire."
16,2,14,"Then I went on to the spring gate and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass."
16,2,15,"Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned."
16,2,16,"The rulers did not know where I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest who did the work."
16,2,17,"Then I said to them, You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come, let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we won't be disgraced."
16,2,18,"I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me, as also of the king's words that he had spoken to me.They said, Let's rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good work."
16,2,19,"But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they ridiculed us, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?"
16,2,20,"Then answered I them, and said to them, The God of heaven will prosper us. Therefore we, his servants, will arise and build; but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem."
16,3,1,"Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up its doors; even to the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananel."
16,3,2,"Next to him built the men of Jericho. Next to them built Zaccur the son of Imri."
16,3,3,"The sons of Hassenaah built the fish gate. They laid its beams, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars."

16,3,7,"Next to them, Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, repaired the residence of the governor beyond the River."

16,3,14,"Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth Haccherem repaired the dung gate. He built it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars."
16,3,15,"Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah repaired the spring gate. He built it, and covered it, and set up its doors, its bolts, and its bars, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king's garden, even to the stairs that go down from the city of David."
16,3,16,"After him, Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth Zur, made repairs to the place opposite the tombs of David, and to the pool that was made, and to the house of the mighty men."
16,3,17,"After him, the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani made repairs. Next to him, Hashabiah, the ruler of half the district of Keilah, made repairs for his district."

16,3,19,"Next to him, Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, repaired another portion, across from the ascent to the armory at the turning of the wall."
16,3,20,"After him, Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired another portion, from the turning of the wall to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest."
16,3,21,"After him, Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz repaired another portion, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib."

16,3,25,"Palal the son of Uzai made repairs opposite the turning of the wall, and the tower that stands out from the upper house of the king, which is by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh made repairs."
16,3,26,"(Now the Nethinim lived in Ophel, to the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that stands out.)"
16,3,27,"After him the Tekoites repaired another portion, over against the great tower that stands out, and to the wall of Ophel."
16,3,28,"Above the horse gate, the priests made repairs, everyone across from his own house."
16,3,29,"After them, Zadok the son of Immer made repairs across from his own house. After him, Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the east gate made repairs."

16,3,31,"After him, Malchijah one of the goldsmiths to the house of the Nethinim, and of the merchants, made repairs over against the gate of Hammiphkad, and to the ascent of the corner."
16,3,32,"Between the ascent of the corner and the sheep gate, the goldsmiths and the merchants made repairs."
16,4,1,"But it happened that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews."
16,4,2,"He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, since they are burned?"
16,4,3,"Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, What they are building, if a fox climbed up it, he would break down their stone wall."
16,4,4,"Hear, our God; for we are despised; and turn back their reproach on their own head, give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity;"
16,4,5,"do not cover their iniquity, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before you; for they have insulted the builders."
16,4,6,"So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half its height: for the people had a mind to work."
16,4,7,"But it happened that when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the breaches began to be filled, then they were very angry;"
16,4,8,"and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein."
16,4,9,"But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them."
16,4,10,"Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is fading, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall."
16,4,11,"Our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, until we come into their midst, and kill them, and cause the work to cease."
16,4,12,"It happened that when the Jews who lived by them came, they said to us ten times from all places, Wherever you turn, they will attack us."
16,4,13,"Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows."
16,4,14,"I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Do not be afraid of them! Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses."
16,4,15,"It happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, that we returned all of us to the wall, everyone to his work."
16,4,16,"It happened from that time forth, that half of my servants worked in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah."
16,4,17,"They all built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work, and with the other held his weapon;"
16,4,18,"and the builders, everyone wore his sword at his side, and so built. He who sounded the trumpet was by me."
16,4,19,"I said to the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, one far from another."
16,4,20,"Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally there to us. Our God will fight for us."
16,4,21,"So we worked in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared."
16,4,22,"Likewise at the same time said I to the people, Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day."
16,4,23,"So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes. Everyone took his weapon to the water."
16,5,1,"Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews."
16,5,2,"For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many. Let us get grain, that we may eat and live."
16,5,3,"Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses. Let us get grain, because of the famine."
16,5,4,"There were also some who said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute using our fields and our vineyards as collateral."
16,5,5,"Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children. Behold, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters have been brought into bondage. Neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards."
16,5,6,"I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words."
16,5,7,"Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, You exact usury, everyone of his brother. I held a great assembly against them."
16,5,8,"I said to them, We, after our ability, have redeemed our brothers the Jews that were sold to the nations; and would you even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to us? Then they held their peace, and found never a word."
16,5,9,"Also I said, The thing that you do is not good. Ought you not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?"
16,5,10,"I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain. Please let us stop this usury."
16,5,11,"Please restore to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you are charging them."
16,5,12,"Then they said, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as you say.Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise."
16,5,13,"Also I shook out my lap, and said, So may God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that doesn't perform this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied.All the assembly said, Amen, and praised the"
16,5,14,"Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor."
16,5,15,"But the former governors who were before me were supported by the people, and took bread and wine from them, besides forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants ruled over the people: but I did not do so, because of the fear of God."
16,5,16,"Yes, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered there to the work."
16,5,17,"Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, one hundred fifty men, besides those who came to us from among the nations that were around us."
16,5,18,"Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I did not demand the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy on this people."
16,5,19,"Remember to me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people."
16,6,1,"Now it happened, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)"
16,6,2,"that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono. But they intended to harm me."
16,6,3,"I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I can't come down. Why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?"
16,6,4,"They sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them the same way."
16,6,5,"Then Sanballat sent his servant to me the same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,"
16,6,6,"in which was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel. Because of that, you are building the wall. You would be their king, according to these words."
16,6,7,"You have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem, saying, 'There is a king in Judah!' Now it will be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together."
16,6,8,"Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as you say, but you imagine them out of your own heart."
16,6,9,"For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands will be weakened from the work, that it not be done. But now, strengthen my hands."
16,6,10,"I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home; and he said, Let us meet together in God's house, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to kill you; yes, in the night will they come to kill you."
16,6,11,"I said, Should such a man as I flee? Who is there that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in."
16,6,12,"I discerned, and behold, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."
16,6,13,"He hired so that I would be afraid, do so, and sin, and that they might have material for an unfavorable report, that they might taunt me."
16,6,14,"Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear."
16,6,15,"So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days."
16,6,16,"It happened, when all our enemies heard of it, that all the nations that were about us were afraid, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God."
16,6,17,"Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah's letters came to them."
16,6,18,"For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife."
16,6,19,"Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear."
16,7,1,"Now it happened, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,"
16,7,2,"that I put my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, in charge of Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many."
16,7,3,"I said to them, Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut the doors, and you bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch, with everyone near his house."
16,7,4,"Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built."
16,7,5,"My God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and I found written therein:"
16,7,6,"These are the children of the province, who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, everyone to his city;"
16,7,7,"who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:"
16,7,8,"The children of Parosh, two thousand one hundred seventy-two."
16,7,9,"The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy-two."
16,7,10,"The children of Arah, six hundred fifty-two."
16,7,11,"The children of Pahathmoab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred eighteen."
16,7,12,"The children of Elam, one thousand two hundred fifty-four."
16,7,13,"The children of Zattu, eight hundred forty-five."
16,7,14,"The children of Zaccai, seven hundred sixty."

16,8,11,"So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be grieved."
16,8,12,"All the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared to them."
16,8,13,"On the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers' households of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the law."
16,8,14,"They found written in the law, how that the"

16,9,8,"and found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it to his seed, and have performed your words; for you are righteous."
16,9,9,"You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea,"
16,9,10,"and showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and against all his servants, and against all the people of his land; for you knew that they dealt proudly against them, and made a name for yourself, as it is this day."
16,9,11,"You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and you cast their pursuers into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters."
16,9,12,"Moreover, in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go."
16,9,13,"You came down also on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,"
16,9,14,"and made known to them your holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses your servant,"
16,9,15,"and gave them bread from the sky for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them."
16,9,16,"But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck, did not listen to your commandments,"
16,9,17,"and refused to obey, neither were they mindful of your wonders that you did among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and did not forsake them."
16,9,18,"Yes, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, 'This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,' and had committed awful blasphemies;"
16,9,19,"yet you in your manifold mercies did not forsake them in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud did not depart from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go."
16,9,20,"You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and did not withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst."
16,9,21,"Yes, forty years you sustained them in the wilderness. They lacked nothing. Their clothes did not grow old, and their feet did not swell."
16,9,22,"Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you allotted according to their portions. So they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."
16,9,23,"You also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it."
16,9,24,"So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they pleased."
16,9,25,"They took fortified cities, and a rich land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns dug out, vineyards, and olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were filled, became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness."
16,9,26,"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their back, and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies."
16,9,27,"Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them. In the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries."
16,9,28,"But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore left you them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times you delivered them according to your mercies,"
16,9,29,"and testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law. Yet they dealt proudly, and did not listen to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances, (which if a man does, he shall live in them), turned their backs, stiffened their neck, and would not hear."
16,9,30,"Yet many years you put up with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet would they not give ear. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands."
16,9,31,"Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God."
16,9,32,"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness, do not let all the travail seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day."
16,9,33,"However you are just in all that has come on us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;"
16,9,34,"neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them."
16,9,35,"For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and rich land which you gave before them, neither did they turn from their wicked works."
16,9,36,"Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good, behold, we are servants in it."
16,9,37,"It yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our livestock, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress."
16,9,38,"Yet for all this, we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, seal it."

16,12,19,"and of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;"
16,12,20,"of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;"
16,12,21,"of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel."
16,12,22,"As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, there were recorded the heads of fathers' households; also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian."
16,12,23,"The sons of Levi, heads of fathers' households, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib."
16,12,24,"The chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers over against them, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, watch next to watch."
16,12,25,"Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the watch at the storehouses of the gates."
16,12,26,"These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest the scribe."
16,12,27,"At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with giving thanks, and with singing, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and with harps."
16,12,28,"The sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain around Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites;"
16,12,29,"also from Beth Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had built them villages around Jerusalem."
16,12,30,"The priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall."
16,12,31,"Then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall, and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession. One went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate;"
16,12,32,"and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,"
16,12,33,"and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,"
16,12,34,"Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,"
16,12,35,"and certain of the priests' sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;"
16,12,36,"and his brothers, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them."
16,12,37,"By the spring gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water gate eastward."
16,12,38,"The other company of those who gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, on the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad wall,"
16,12,39,"and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard."
16,12,40,"So stood the two companies of those who gave thanks in God's house, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;"
16,12,41,"and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;"
16,12,42,"and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer."
16,12,43,"They offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off."
16,12,44,"On that day were men appointed over the rooms for the treasures, for the wave offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who waited."
16,12,45,"They performed the duty of their God, and the duty of the purification, and so did the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son."
16,12,46,"For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God."
16,12,47,"All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron."
16,13,1,"On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever,"
16,13,2,"because they did not meet the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: however our God turned the curse into a blessing."
16,13,3,"It came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude."
16,13,4,"Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah,"
16,13,5,"had prepared for him a great room, where before they laid the meal offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the wave offerings for the priests."
16,13,6,"But in all this, I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,"
16,13,7,"and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a room in the courts of God's house."
16,13,8,"It grieved me severely: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the room."
16,13,9,"Then I commanded, and they cleansed the rooms: and there brought I again the vessels of God's house, with the meal offerings and the frankincense."
16,13,10,"I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had fled everyone to his field."
16,13,11,"Then I contended with the rulers, and said, Why is God's house forsaken? I gathered them together, and set them in their place."
16,13,12,"Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries."
16,13,13,"I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute to their brothers."
16,13,14,"Remember me, my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its observances."
16,13,15,"In those days I saw in Judah some men treading winepresses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day in which they sold food."
16,13,16,"There lived men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all kinds of wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem."
16,13,17,"Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the Sabbath day?"
16,13,18,"Did not your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all this disaster on us, and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath."
16,13,19,"It came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. I set some of my servants over the gates, that no burden should be brought in on the Sabbath day."
16,13,20,"So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice."
16,13,21,"Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why do you stay around the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time on, they did not come on the Sabbath."
16,13,22,"I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember to me, my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness."
16,13,23,"In those days also saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:"
16,13,24,"and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people."
16,13,25,"I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves."
16,13,26,"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin."
16,13,27,"Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?"
16,13,28,"One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me."
16,13,29,"Remember them, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites."
16,13,30,"Thus I cleansed them from all foreigners, and appointed duties for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work;"
16,13,31,"and for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good."
17,1,1,"Now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred twenty-seven provinces),"
17,1,2,"that in those days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,"
17,1,3,"in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him."
17,1,4,"He displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even one hundred eighty days."
17,1,5,"When these days were fulfilled, the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, in the court of the garden of the king's palace."
17,1,6,"There were hangings of white, green, and blue material, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars. The couches were of gold and silver, on a pavement of red, white, yellow, and black marble."
17,1,7,"They gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds, including royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king."
17,1,8,"In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure."
17,1,9,"Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus."
17,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,"
17,1,11,"to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty; for she was beautiful."
17,1,12,"But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by the eunuchs. Therefore the king was very angry, and his anger burned in him."
17,1,13,"Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for it was the king's custom to consult those who knew law and judgment;"
17,1,14,"and the next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom),"
17,1,15,"What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?"
17,1,16,"Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king, but also to all the princes, and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus."
17,1,17,"For this deed of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to show contempt for their husbands, when it is reported, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she did not come.'"
17,1,18,"Today, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's deed will tell all the king's princes. This will cause much contempt and wrath."
17,1,19,"If it please the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she."
17,1,20,"When the king's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give their husbands honor, both great and small."
17,1,21,"This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan:"
17,1,22,"for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, that every man should rule his own house, speaking in the language of his own people."
17,2,1,"After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her."
17,2,2,"Then the king's servants who served him said, Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king."
17,2,3,"Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the women's house, to the custody of Hegai the king's eunuch, keeper of the women. Let cosmetics be given them;"
17,2,4,"and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. The thing pleased the king, and he did so."
17,2,5,"There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,"
17,2,6,"who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away."
17,2,7,"He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother. The maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter."
17,2,8,"So it happened, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women."
17,2,9,"The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king's house. He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women's house."
17,2,10,"Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known."
17,2,11,"Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women's house, to find out how Esther did, and what would become of her."
17,2,12,"Each young woman's turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women)."
17,2,13,"The young woman then came to the king like this: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women's house to the king's house."
17,2,14,"In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women's house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name."
17,2,15,"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her."
17,2,16,"So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign."
17,2,17,"The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti."
17,2,18,"Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king's bounty."
17,2,19,"When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate."
17,2,20,"Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him."
17,2,21,"In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus."
17,2,22,"This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai's name."
17,2,23,"When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king's presence."
17,3,1,"After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him."
17,3,2,"All the king's servants who were in the king's gate bowed down, and paid homage to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or pay him homage."
17,3,3,"Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why do you disobey the king's commandment?"
17,3,4,"Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he did not listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew."
17,3,5,"When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down, nor pay him homage, Haman was full of wrath."
17,3,6,"But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him Mordecai's people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even Mordecai's people."
17,3,7,"In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar."
17,3,8,"Haman said to King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different than other people's. They do not keep the king's laws. Therefore it is not for the king's profit to allow them to remain."
17,3,9,"If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who are in charge of the king's business, to bring it into the king's treasuries."
17,3,10,"The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy."
17,3,11,"The king said to Haman, The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you."
17,3,12,"Then the king's scribes were called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and all that Haman commanded was written to the king's satraps, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according its writing, and to every people in their language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus, and it was sealed with the king's ring."
17,3,13,"Letters were sent by couriers into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions."
17,3,14,"A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day."
17,3,15,"The couriers went forth in haste by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed."
17,4,1,"Now when Mordecai found out all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and wailed loudly and a bitterly."
17,4,2,"He came even before the king's gate, for no one is allowed inside the king's gate clothed with sackcloth."
17,4,3,"In every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
17,4,4,"Esther's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved. She sent clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth; but he did not receive it."
17,4,5,"Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was."
17,4,6,"So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was before the king's gate."
17,4,7,"Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews."
17,4,8,"He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him, for her people."
17,4,9,"Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai."
17,4,10,"Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai:"
17,4,11,"All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, know, that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold out the golden scepter, that he may live. I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days."
17,4,12,"They told to Mordecai Esther's words."
17,4,13,"Then Mordecai asked them return answer to Esther, Do not think to yourself that you will escape in the king's house any more than all the Jews."
17,4,14,"For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. Who knows if you haven't come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
17,4,15,"Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai,"
17,4,16,"Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish."
17,4,17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him."
17,5,1,"Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, next to the king's house. The king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, next to the entrance of the house."
17,5,2,"When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther came near, and touched the top of the scepter."
17,5,3,"Then the king asked her, What would you like, queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom."
17,5,4,"Esther said, If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him."
17,5,5,"Then the king said, Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done as Esther has said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared."
17,5,6,"The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."
17,5,7,"Then Esther answered and said, My petition and my request is this."
17,5,8,"If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said."
17,5,9,"Then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he did not stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai."
17,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home. There, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife."
17,5,11,"Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the multitude of his children, all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king."
17,5,12,"Haman also said, Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king."
17,5,13,"Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."
17,5,14,"Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on it. Then go in merrily with the king to the banquet. This pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made."
17,6,1,"On that night, the king couldn't sleep. He commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought, and they were read to the king."
17,6,2,"It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, who had tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus."
17,6,3,"The king said, What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?Then the king's servants who attended him said, Nothing has been done for him."
17,6,4,"The king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king's house, to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him."
17,6,5,"The king's servants said to him, Behold, Haman stands in the court.The king said, Let him come in."
17,6,6,"So Haman came in. The king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?Now Haman said in his heart, Who would the king delight to honor more than myself?"
17,6,7,"Haman said to the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor,"
17,6,8,"let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the head of which a crown royal is set."
17,6,9,"Let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delights to honor with them, and have him ride on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, 'Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!'"
17,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman, Hurry and take the clothing and the horse, as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate. Let nothing fail of all that you have spoken."
17,6,11,"Then Haman took the clothing and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and had him ride through the city square, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!"
17,6,12,"Mordecai came back to the king's gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning and having his head covered."
17,6,13,"Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him, but you will surely fall before him."
17,6,14,"While they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared."
17,7,1,"So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen."
17,7,2,"The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is your petition, queen Esther? It shall be granted you. What is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."
17,7,3,"Then Esther the queen answered, If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request."
17,7,4,"For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondservants and bondmaids, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king's loss."
17,7,5,"Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so?"
17,7,6,"Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman!Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen."
17,7,7,"The king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden. Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king."
17,7,8,"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, Will he even assault the queen in front of me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face."
17,7,9,"Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were with the king said, Behold, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, is standing at Haman's house.The king said, Hang him on it!"
17,7,10,"So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified."
17,8,1,"On that day, King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews' enemy, to Esther the queen. Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her."
17,8,2,"The king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."
17,8,3,"Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and begged him with tears to put away the evil of Haman the Agagite, and his plot that he had devised against the Jews."
17,8,4,"Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood before the king."
17,8,5,"She said, If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right to the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces."
17,8,6,"For how can I endure to see the disaster that would come to my people? How can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives?"
17,8,7,"Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, See, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged on the gallows, because he laid his hand on the Jews."
17,8,8,"Write also to the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring; for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may not be reversed by any man."
17,8,9,"Then the king's scribes were called at that time, in the third month Sivan, on the twenty-third day of the month; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India to Ethiopia, one hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language, and to the Jews in their writing, and in their language."
17,8,10,"He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by courier on horseback, riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds."
17,8,11,"In those letters, the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together, and to defend their life, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to plunder their possessions,"
17,8,12,"on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar."
17,8,13,"A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to all the peoples, that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies."
17,8,14,"So the couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. The decree was given out in the citadel of Susa."
17,8,15,"Mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa shouted and was glad."
17,8,16,"The Jews had light, gladness, joy, and honor."
17,8,17,"In every province, and in every city, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness, joy, a feast, and a good day. Many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen on them."
17,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the month, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to conquer them, (but it was turned out the opposite happened, that the Jews conquered those who hated them),"
17,9,2,"the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, to lay hands on those who wanted to harm them. No one could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen on all the people."
17,9,3,"All the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who did the king's business helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them."
17,9,4,"For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater."
17,9,5,"The Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted to those who hated them."
17,9,6,"In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men."
17,9,7,"They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,"
17,9,8,"Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,"
17,9,9,"Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,"
17,9,10,"the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew's enemy, but they did not lay their hand on the plunder."
17,9,11,"On that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king."
17,9,12,"The king said to Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa, including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your further request? It shall be done."
17,9,13,"Then Esther said, If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows."
17,9,14,"The king commanded this to be done. A decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons."
17,9,15,"The Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men in Shushan; but they did not lay their hand on the spoil."
17,9,16,"The other Jews who were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, defended their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they did not lay their hand on the plunder."
17,9,17,"This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
17,9,18,"But the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month; and on the fifteenth day of that month, they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
17,9,19,"Therefore the Judeans of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a good day, and a day of sending presents of food to one another."
17,9,20,"Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far,"
17,9,21,"to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar yearly,"
17,9,22,"as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending presents of food to one another, and gifts to the needy."
17,9,23,"The Jews accepted the custom that they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them;"
17,9,24,"because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;"
17,9,25,"but when this became known to the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows."
17,9,26,"Therefore they called these days Purim, from the word Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come to them,"
17,9,27,"the Jews established, and imposed on themselves, and on their descendants, and on all those who joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to what was written, and according to its appointed time, every year;"
17,9,28,"and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memory of them perish from their seed."
17,9,29,"Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim."
17,9,30,"He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,"
17,9,31,"to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had decreed, and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry."
17,9,32,"The commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book."
17,10,1,"King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the islands of the sea."
17,10,2,"All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?"
17,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew was next to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brothers, seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to all his descendants."
18,1,1,"There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil."
18,1,2,"There were born to him seven sons and three daughters."
18,1,3,"His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east."
18,1,4,"His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them."
18,1,5,"It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Job did so continually."
18,1,6,"Now it happened on the day when the God's sons came to present themselves before the"
18,1,7,"The"
18,1,8,"The"
18,1,9,"Then Satan answered the"
18,1,10,"Haven't you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land."
18,1,11,"But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face."
18,1,12,"The"
18,1,13,"It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,"
18,1,14,"that there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,"
18,1,15,"and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
18,1,16,"While he was still speaking, there also came another, and said, The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
18,1,17,"While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you."
18,1,18,"While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,"
18,1,19,"and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you."
18,1,20,"Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped."
18,1,21,"He said, Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there. The"
18,1,22,"In all this, Job did not sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing."
18,2,1,"Again it happened on the day when the God's sons came to present themselves before the"
18,2,2,"The"
18,2,3,"The"
18,2,4,"Satan answered the"
18,2,5,"But put forth your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face."
18,2,6,"The"
18,2,7,"So Satan went forth from the presence of the"
18,2,8,"He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes."
18,2,9,"Then his wife said to him, Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die."
18,2,10,"But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?In all this Job did not sin with his lips."
18,2,11,"Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him."
18,2,12,"When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and did not recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky."
18,2,13,"So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great."
18,3,1,"After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth."
18,3,2,"Job answered:"
18,3,3,"Let the day perish in which I was born,the night which said, 'There is a boy conceived.'"
18,3,4,"Let that day be darkness.Do not let God from above seek for it,neither let the light shine on it."
18,3,5,"Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own.Let a cloud dwell on it.Let all that makes black the day terrify it."
18,3,6,"As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it.Let it not rejoice among the days of the year.Let it not come into the number of the months."
18,3,7,"Behold, let that night be barren.Let no joyful voice come therein."
18,3,8,"Let them curse it who curse the day,who are ready to rouse up leviathan."
18,3,9,"Let the stars of its twilight be dark.Let it look for light, but have none,neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,"
18,3,10,"because it did not shut up the doors of my mother's womb,nor did it hide trouble from my eyes."
18,3,11,"Why did I not die from the womb?Why did I not give up the spirit when my mother bore me?"
18,3,12,"Why did the knees receive me?Or why the breast, that I should suck?"
18,3,13,"For now should I have lain down and been quiet.I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,"
18,3,14,"with kings and counselors of the earth,who built up waste places for themselves;"
18,3,15,"or with princes who had gold,who filled their houses with silver:"
18,3,16,"or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,as infants who never saw light."
18,3,17,"There the wicked cease from troubling.There the weary are at rest."
18,3,18,"There the prisoners are at ease together.They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster."
18,3,19,"The small and the great are there.The servant is free from his master."
18,3,20,"Why is light given to him who is in misery,life to the bitter in soul,"
18,3,21,"Who long for death, but it doesn't come;and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,"
18,3,22,"who rejoice exceedingly,and are glad, when they can find the grave?"
18,3,23,"Why is light given to a man whose way is hid,whom God has hedged in?"
18,3,24,"For my sighing comes before I eat.My groanings are poured out like water."
18,3,25,"For the thing which I fear comes on me,That which I am afraid of comes to me."
18,3,26,"I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;but trouble comes."
18,4,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,"
18,4,2,"If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved?But who can withhold himself from speaking?"
18,4,3,"Behold, you have instructed many,you have strengthened the weak hands."
18,4,4,"Your words have supported him who was falling,You have made firm the feeble knees."
18,4,5,"But now it is come to you, and you faint.It touches you, and you are troubled."
18,4,6,"Isn't your piety your confidence?Isn't the integrity of your ways your hope?"
18,4,7,"Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent?Or where were the upright cut off?"
18,4,8,"According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity,and sow trouble,reap the same."
18,4,9,"By the breath of God they perish.By the blast of his anger are they consumed."
18,4,10,"The roaring of the lion,and the voice of the fierce lion,the teeth of the young lions, are broken."
18,4,11,"The old lion perishes for lack of prey.The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad."
18,4,12,"Now a thing was secretly brought to me.My ear received a whisper of it."
18,4,13,"In thoughts from the visions of the night,when deep sleep falls on men,"
18,4,14,"fear came on me, and trembling,which made all my bones shake."
18,4,15,"Then a spirit passed before my face.The hair of my flesh stood up."
18,4,16,"It stood still, but I couldn't discern its appearance.A form was before my eyes.Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,"
18,4,17,"'Shall mortal man be more just than God?Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?"
18,4,18,"Behold, he puts no trust in his servants.He charges his angels with error."
18,4,19,"How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay,whose foundation is in the dust,who are crushed before the moth!"
18,4,20,"Between morning and evening they are destroyed.They perish forever without any regarding it."
18,4,21,"Isn't their tent cord plucked up within them?They die, and that without wisdom.'"
18,5,1,"Call now; is there any who will answer you?To which of the holy ones will you turn?"
18,5,2,"For resentment kills the foolish man,and jealousy kills the simple."
18,5,3,"I have seen the foolish taking root,but suddenly I cursed his habitation."
18,5,4,"His children are far from safety.They are crushed in the gate.Neither is there any to deliver them,"
18,5,5,"whose harvest the hungry eats up,and take it even out of the thorns.The snare gapes for their substance."
18,5,6,"For affliction doesn't come forth from the dust,neither does trouble spring out of the ground;"
18,5,7,"but man is born to trouble,as the sparks fly upward."
18,5,8,"But as for me, I would seek God.I would commit my cause to God,"
18,5,9,"who does great things that can't be fathomed,marvelous things without number;"
18,5,10,"who gives rain on the earth,and sends waters on the fields;"
18,5,11,"so that he sets up on high those who are low,those who mourn are exalted to safety."
18,5,12,"He frustrates the devices of the crafty,So that their hands can't perform their enterprise."
18,5,13,"He takes the wise in their own craftiness;the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong."
18,5,14,"They meet with darkness in the day time,and grope at noonday as in the night."
18,5,15,"But he saves from the sword of their mouth,even the needy from the hand of the mighty."
18,5,16,"So the poor has hope,and injustice shuts her mouth."
18,5,17,"Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects.Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty."
18,5,18,"For he wounds, and binds up.He injures, and his hands make whole."
18,5,19,"He will deliver you in six troubles;yes, in seven there shall no evil touch you."
18,5,20,"In famine he will redeem you from death;in war, from the power of the sword."
18,5,21,"You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes."
18,5,22,"At destruction and famine you shall laugh,neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth."
18,5,23,"For you shall be in league with the stones of the field.The animals of the field shall be at peace with you."
18,5,24,"You shall know that your tent is in peace.You shall visit your fold, and shall miss nothing."
18,5,25,"You shall know also that your seed shall be great,Your offspring as the grass of the earth."
18,5,26,"You shall come to your grave in a full age,like a shock of grain comes in its season."
18,5,27,"Look this, we have searched it, so it is.Hear it, and know it for your good."
18,6,1,"Then Job answered,"
18,6,2,"Oh that my anguish were weighed,and all my calamity laid in the balances!"
18,6,3,"For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,therefore have my words been rash."
18,6,4,"For the arrows of the Almighty are within me.My spirit drinks up their poison.The terrors of God set themselves in array against me."
18,6,5,"Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass?Or does the ox low over his fodder?"
18,6,6,"Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt?Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?"
18,6,7,"My soul refuses to touch them.They are as loathsome food to me."
18,6,8,"Oh that I might have my request,that God would grant the thing that I long for,"
18,6,9,"even that it would please God to crush me;that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!"
18,6,10,"Be it still my consolation,yes, let me exult in pain that doesn't spare,that I have not denied the words of the Holy One."
18,6,11,"What is my strength, that I should wait?What is my end, that I should be patient?"
18,6,12,"Is my strength the strength of stones?Or is my flesh of brass?"
18,6,13,"Isn't it that I have no help in me,That wisdom is driven quite from me?"
18,6,14,"To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend;even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty."
18,6,15,"My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook,as the channel of brooks that pass away;"
18,6,16,"Which are black by reason of the ice,in which the snow hides itself."
18,6,17,"In the dry season, they vanish.When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place."
18,6,18,"The caravans that travel beside them turn aside.They go up into the waste, and perish."
18,6,19,"The caravans of Tema looked.The companies of Sheba waited for them."
18,6,20,"They were distressed because they were confident.They came there, and were confounded."
18,6,21,"For now you are nothing.You see a terror, and are afraid."
18,6,22,"Did I say, 'Give to me?'or, 'Offer a present for me from your substance?'"
18,6,23,"or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand?'or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?'"
18,6,24,"Teach me, and I will hold my peace.Cause me to understand wherein I have erred."
18,6,25,"How forcible are words of uprightness!But your reproof, what does it reprove?"
18,6,26,"Do you intend to reprove words,seeing that the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?"
18,6,27,"Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless,and make merchandise of your friend."
18,6,28,"Now therefore be pleased to look at me,for surely I shall not lie to your face."
18,6,29,"Please return.Let there be no injustice.Yes, return again.My cause is righteous."
18,6,30,"Is there injustice on my tongue?Can't my taste discern mischievous things?"
18,7,1,"Isn't a man forced to labor on earth?Aren't his days like the days of a hired hand?"
18,7,2,"As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow,as a hireling who looks for his wages,"
18,7,3,"so am I made to possess months of misery,wearisome nights are appointed to me."
18,7,4,"When I lie down, I say,'When shall I arise, and the night be gone?'I toss and turn until the dawning of the day."
18,7,5,"My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust.My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh."
18,7,6,"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle,and are spent without hope."
18,7,7,"Oh remember that my life is a breath.My eye shall no more see good."
18,7,8,"The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more.Your eyes shall be on me, but I shall not be."
18,7,9,"As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away,so he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more."
18,7,10,"He shall return no more to his house,neither shall his place know him any more."
18,7,11,"Therefore I will not keep silent.I will speak in the anguish of my spirit.I will complain in the bitterness of my soul."
18,7,12,"Am I a sea, or a sea monster,that you put a guard over me?"
18,7,13,"When I say, 'My bed shall comfort me.My couch shall ease my complaint;'"
18,7,14,"then you scare me with dreams,and terrify me through visions:"
18,7,15,"so that my soul chooses strangling,death rather than my bones."
18,7,16,"I loathe my life.I do not want to live forever.Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath."
18,7,17,"What is man, that you should magnify him,that you should set your mind on him,"
18,7,18,"that you should visit him every morning,and test him every moment?"
18,7,19,"How long will you not look away from me,nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle?"
18,7,20,"If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men?Why have you set me as a mark for you,so that I am a burden to myself?"
18,7,21,"Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity?For now shall I lie down in the dust.You will seek me diligently, but I shall not be."
18,8,1,"Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,"
18,8,2,"How long will you speak these things?Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?"
18,8,3,"Does God pervert justice?Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?"
18,8,4,"If your children have sinned against him,He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience."
18,8,5,"If you want to seek God diligently,make your supplication to the Almighty."
18,8,6,"If you were pure and upright,surely now he would awaken for you,and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous."
18,8,7,"Though your beginning was small,yet your latter end would greatly increase."
18,8,8,"Please inquire of past generations.Find out about the learning of their fathers."
18,8,9,"(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,because our days on earth are a shadow.)"
18,8,10,"Shall they not teach you, tell you,and utter words out of their heart?"
18,8,11,"Can the papyrus grow up without mire?Can the rushes grow without water?"
18,8,12,"While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down,it withers before any other reed."
18,8,13,"So are the paths of all who forget God.The hope of the godless man shall perish,"
18,8,14,"Whose confidence shall break apart,Whose trust is a spider's web."
18,8,15,"He shall lean on his house, but it shall not stand.He shall cling to it, but it shall not endure."
18,8,16,"He is green before the sun.His shoots go forth over his garden."
18,8,17,"His roots are wrapped around the rock pile.He sees the place of stones."
18,8,18,"If he is destroyed from his place,then it shall deny him, saying, 'I have not seen you.'"
18,8,19,"Behold, this is the joy of his way:out of the earth, others shall spring."
18,8,20,"Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man,neither will he uphold the evildoers."
18,8,21,"He will still fill your mouth with laughter,your lips with shouting."
18,8,22,"Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame.The tent of the wicked shall be no more."
18,9,1,"Then Job answered,"
18,9,2,"Truly I know that it is so,but how can man be just with God?"
18,9,3,"If he is pleased to contend with him,he can't answer him one time in a thousand."
18,9,4,"God who is wise in heart, and mighty in strength:who has hardened himself against him, and prospered?"
18,9,5,"He removes the mountains, and they do not know it,when he overturns them in his anger."
18,9,6,"He shakes the earth out of its place.Its pillars tremble."
18,9,7,"He commands the sun, and it doesn't rise,and seals up the stars."
18,9,8,"He alone stretches out the heavens,and treads on the waves of the sea."
18,9,9,"He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,and the chambers of the south."
18,9,10,"He does great things past finding out;yes, marvelous things without number."
18,9,11,"Behold, he goes by me, and I do not see him.He passes on also, but I do not perceive him."
18,9,12,"Behold, he snatches away.Who can hinder him?Who will ask him, 'What are you doing?'"
18,9,13,"God will not withdraw his anger.The helpers of Rahab stoop under him."
18,9,14,"How much less shall I answer him,And choose my words to argue with him?"
18,9,15,"Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn't answer him.I would make supplication to my judge."
18,9,16,"If I had called, and he had answered me,yet I wouldn't believe that he listened to my voice."
18,9,17,"For he breaks me with a storm,and multiplies my wounds without cause."
18,9,18,"He will not allow me to catch my breath,but fills me with bitterness."
18,9,19,"If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty!If of justice, 'Who,' says he, 'will summon me?'"
18,9,20,"Though I am righteous, my own mouth shall condemn me.Though I am blameless, it shall prove me perverse."
18,9,21,"I am blameless.I do not regard myself.I despise my life."
18,9,22,"It is all the same.Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked."
18,9,23,"If the scourge kills suddenly,he will mock at the trial of the innocent."
18,9,24,"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.He covers the faces of its judges.If not he, then who is it?"
18,9,25,"Now my days are swifter than a runner.They flee away, they see no good,"
18,9,26,"They have passed away as the swift ships,as the eagle that swoops on the prey."
18,9,27,"If I say, 'I will forget my complaint,I will put off my sad face, and cheer up;'"
18,9,28,"I am afraid of all my sorrows,I know that you will not hold me innocent."
18,9,29,"I shall be condemned.Why then do I labor in vain?"
18,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow,and cleanse my hands with lye,"
18,9,31,"yet you will plunge me in the ditch.My own clothes shall abhor me."
18,9,32,"For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,that we should come together in judgment."
18,9,33,"There is no umpire between us,that might lay his hand on us both."
18,9,34,"Let him take his rod away from me.Let his terror not make me afraid;"
18,9,35,"then I would speak, and not fear him,for I am not so in myself."
18,10,1,"My soul is weary of my life.I will give free course to my complaint.I will speak in the bitterness of my soul."
18,10,2,"I will tell God, 'Do not condemn me.Show me why you contend with me."
18,10,3,"Is it good to you that you should oppress,that you should despise the work of your hands,and smile on the counsel of the wicked?"
18,10,4,"Do you have eyes of flesh?Or do you see as man sees?"
18,10,5,"Are your days as the days of mortals,or your years as man's years,"
18,10,6,"that you inquire after my iniquity,and search after my sin?"
18,10,7,"Although you know that I am not wicked,there is no one who can deliver out of your hand."
18,10,8,"'Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether,yet you destroy me."
18,10,9,"Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay.Will you bring me into dust again?"
18,10,10,"Haven't you poured me out like milk,and curdled me like cheese?"
18,10,11,"You have clothed me with skin and flesh,and knit me together with bones and sinews."
18,10,12,"You have granted me life and loving kindness.Your visitation has preserved my spirit."
18,10,13,"Yet you hid these things in your heart.I know that this is with you:"
18,10,14,"if I sin, then you mark me.You will not acquit me from my iniquity."
18,10,15,"If I am wicked, woe to me.If I am righteous, I still shall not lift up my head,being filled with disgrace,and conscious of my affliction."
18,10,16,"If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion.Again you show yourself powerful to me."
18,10,17,"You renew your witnesses against me,and increase your indignation on me.Changes and warfare are with me."
18,10,18,"'Why, then, have you brought me forth out of the womb?I wish I had given up the spirit, and no eye had seen me."
18,10,19,"I should have been as though I had not been.I should have been carried from the womb to the grave."
18,10,20,"Aren't my days few?Cease then.Leave me alone, that I may find a little comfort,"
18,10,21,"before I go where I shall not return from,to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;"
18,10,22,"the land dark as midnight,of the shadow of death,without any order,where the light is as midnight.'"
18,11,1,"Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered,"
18,11,2,"Shouldn't the multitude of words be answered?Should a man full of talk be justified?"
18,11,3,"Should your boastings make men hold their peace?When you mock, shall no man make you ashamed?"
18,11,4,"For you say, 'My doctrine is pure.I am clean in your eyes.'"
18,11,5,"But oh that God would speak,and open his lips against you,"
18,11,6,"that he would show you the secrets of wisdom!For true wisdom has two sides.Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves."
18,11,7,"Can you fathom the mystery of God?Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty?"
18,11,8,"They are high as heaven. What can you do?They are deeper than Sheol. What can you know?"
18,11,9,"Its measure is longer than the earth,and broader than the sea."
18,11,10,"If he passes by, or confines,or convenes a court, then who can oppose him?"
18,11,11,"For he knows false men.He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn't consider it."
18,11,12,"An empty-headed man becomes wisewhen a man is born as a wild donkey's colt."
18,11,13,"If you set your heart aright,stretch out your hands toward him."
18,11,14,"If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away.Do not let unrighteousness dwell in your tents."
18,11,15,"Surely then you shall lift up your face without spot;Yes, you shall be steadfast, and shall not fear:"
18,11,16,"for you shall forget your misery.You shall remember it as waters that are passed away."
18,11,17,"Life shall be clearer than the noonday.Though there is darkness, it shall be as the morning."
18,11,18,"You shall be secure, because there is hope.Yes, you shall search, and shall take your rest in safety."
18,11,19,"Also you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid.Yes, many shall court your favor."
18,11,20,"But the eyes of the wicked shall fail.They shall have no way to flee.Their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit."
18,12,1,"Then Job answered,"
18,12,2,"No doubt, but you are the people,and wisdom shall die with you."
18,12,3,"But I have understanding as well as you;I am not inferior to you.Yes, who doesn't know such things as these?"
18,12,4,"I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor,I, who called on God, and he answered.The just, the blameless man is a joke."
18,12,5,"In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune.It is ready for them whose foot slips."
18,12,6,"The tents of robbers prosper.Those who provoke God are secure,who carry their God in their hands."
18,12,7,"But ask the animals, now, and they shall teach you;the birds of the sky, and they shall tell you."
18,12,8,"Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you.The fish of the sea shall declare to you."
18,12,9,"Who doesn't know that in all these,the hand of the"
18,12,10,"in whose hand is the life of every living thing,and the breath of all mankind?"
18,12,11,"Doesn't the ear try words,even as the palate tastes its food?"
18,12,12,"With aged men is wisdom,in length of days understanding."
18,12,13,"With God is wisdom and might.He has counsel and understanding."
18,12,14,"Behold, he breaks down, and it can't be built again.He imprisons a man, and there can be no release."
18,12,15,"Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up.Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth."
18,12,16,"With him is strength and wisdom.The deceived and the deceiver are his."
18,12,17,"He leads counselors away stripped.He makes judges fools."
18,12,18,"He loosens the bond of kings.He binds their waist with a belt."
18,12,19,"He leads priests away stripped,and overthrows the mighty."
18,12,20,"He removes the speech of those who are trusted,and takes away the understanding of the elders."
18,12,21,"He pours contempt on princes,and loosens the belt of the strong."
18,12,22,"He uncovers deep things out of darkness,and brings out to light the shadow of death."
18,12,23,"He increases the nations, and he destroys them.He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive."
18,12,24,"He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth,and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way."
18,12,25,"They grope in the dark without light.He makes them stagger like a drunken man."
18,13,1,"Behold, my eye has seen all this.My ear has heard and understood it."
18,13,2,"What you know, I know also.I am not inferior to you."
18,13,3,"Surely I would speak to the Almighty.I desire to reason with God."
18,13,4,"But you are forgers of lies.You are all physicians of no value."
18,13,5,"Oh that you would be completely silent!Then you would be wise."
18,13,6,"Hear now my reasoning.Listen to the pleadings of my lips."
18,13,7,"Will you speak unrighteously for God,and talk deceitfully for him?"
18,13,8,"Will you show partiality to him?Will you contend for God?"
18,13,9,"Is it good that he should search you out?Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him?"
18,13,10,"He will surely reprove youif you secretly show partiality."
18,13,11,"Shall not his majesty make you afraid,And his dread fall on you?"
18,13,12,"Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes,Your defenses are defenses of clay."
18,13,13,"Be silent, leave me alone, that I may speak.Let come on me what will."
18,13,14,"Why should I take my flesh in my teeth,and put my life in my hand?"
18,13,15,"Behold, he will kill me.I have no hope.Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him."
18,13,16,"This also shall be my salvation,that a godless man shall not come before him."
18,13,17,"Hear diligently my speech.Let my declaration be in your ears."
18,13,18,"See now, I have set my cause in order.I know that I am righteous."
18,13,19,"Who is he who will contend with me?For then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit."
18,13,20,"Only do not do two things to me;then I will not hide myself from your face:"
18,13,21,"withdraw your hand far from me;and do not let your terror make me afraid."
18,13,22,"Then call, and I will answer;or let me speak, and you answer me."
18,13,23,"How many are my iniquities and sins?Make me know my disobedience and my sin."
18,13,24,"Why hide you your face,and hold me for your enemy?"
18,13,25,"Will you harass a driven leaf?Will you pursue the dry stubble?"
18,13,26,"For you write bitter things against me,and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth:"
18,13,27,"You also put my feet in the stocks,and mark all my paths.You set a bound to the soles of my feet,"
18,13,28,"though I am decaying like a rotten thing,like a garment that is moth-eaten."
18,14,1,"Man, who is born of a woman,is of few days, and full of trouble."
18,14,2,"He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down.He also flees like a shadow, and doesn't continue."
18,14,3,"Do you open your eyes on such a one,and bring me into judgment with you?"
18,14,4,"Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?Not one."
18,14,5,"Seeing his days are determined,the number of his months is with you,and you have appointed his bounds that he can't pass;"
18,14,6,"Look away from him, that he may rest,until he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day."
18,14,7,"For there is hope for a tree,If it is cut down, that it will sprout again,that the tender branch of it will not cease."
18,14,8,"Though its root grows old in the earth,and its stock dies in the ground,"
18,14,9,"yet through the scent of water it will bud,and put forth boughs like a plant."
18,14,10,"But man dies, and is laid low.Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he?"
18,14,11,"As the waters fail from the sea,and the river wastes and dries up,"
18,14,12,"so man lies down and doesn't rise.Until the heavens are no more, they shall not awake,nor be roused out of their sleep."
18,14,13,"Oh that you would hide me in Sheol,that you would keep me secret, until your wrath is past,that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!"
18,14,14,"If a man dies, shall he live again?All the days of my warfare would I wait,until my release should come."
18,14,15,"You would call, and I would answer you.You would have a desire to the work of your hands."
18,14,16,"But now you number my steps.Do you not watch over my sin?"
18,14,17,"My disobedience is sealed up in a bag.You fasten up my iniquity."
18,14,18,"But the mountain falling comes to nothing.The rock is removed out of its place;"
18,14,19,"The waters wear the stones.The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth.So you destroy the hope of man."
18,14,20,"You forever prevail against him, and he departs.You change his face, and send him away."
18,14,21,"His sons come to honor, and he doesn't know it.They are brought low, but he doesn't perceive it of them."
18,14,22,"But his flesh on him has pain,and his soul within him mourns."
18,15,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,"
18,15,2,"Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge,and fill himself with the east wind?"
18,15,3,"Should he reason with unprofitable talk,or with speeches with which he can do no good?"
18,15,4,"Yes, you do away with fear,and hinder devotion before God."
18,15,5,"For your iniquity teaches your mouth,and you choose the language of the crafty."
18,15,6,"Your own mouth condemns you, and not I.Yes, your own lips testify against you."
18,15,7,"Are you the first man who was born?Or were you brought forth before the hills?"
18,15,8,"Have you heard the secret counsel of God?Do you limit wisdom to yourself?"
18,15,9,"What do you know, that we do not know?What do you understand, which is not in us?"
18,15,10,"With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men,much elder than your father."
18,15,11,"Are the consolations of God too small for you,even the word that is gentle toward you?"
18,15,12,"Why does your heart carry you away?Why do your eyes flash,"
18,15,13,"That you turn your spirit against God,and let such words go out of your mouth?"
18,15,14,"What is man, that he should be clean?What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?"
18,15,15,"Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones.Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight;"
18,15,16,"how much less one who is abominable and corrupt,a man who drinks iniquity like water!"
18,15,17,"I will show you, listen to me;that which I have seen I will declare:"
18,15,18,"(Which wise men have told by their fathers,and have not hidden it;"
18,15,19,"to whom alone the land was given,and no stranger passed among them):"
18,15,20,"the wicked man writhes in pain all his days,even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor."
18,15,21,"A sound of terrors is in his ears.In prosperity the destroyer shall come on him."
18,15,22,"He doesn't believe that he shall return out of darkness.He is waited for by the sword."
18,15,23,"He wanders abroad for bread, saying, 'Where is it?'He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand."
18,15,24,"Distress and anguish make him afraid.They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle."
18,15,25,"Because he has stretched out his hand against God,and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty;"
18,15,26,"he runs at him with a stiff neck,with the thick shields of his bucklers;"
18,15,27,"because he has covered his face with his fatness,and gathered fat on his thighs."
18,15,28,"He has lived in desolate cities,in houses which no one inhabited,which were ready to become heaps."
18,15,29,"He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth."
18,15,30,"He shall not depart out of darkness.The flame shall dry up his branches.By the breath of God's mouth shall he go away."
18,15,31,"Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself;for emptiness shall be his reward."
18,15,32,"It shall be accomplished before his time.His branch shall not be green."
18,15,33,"He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine,and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree."
18,15,34,"For the company of the godless shall be barren,and fire shall consume the tents of bribery."
18,15,35,"They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.Their heart prepares deceit."
18,16,1,"Then Job answered,"
18,16,2,"I have heard many such things.You are all miserable comforters!"
18,16,3,"Shall vain words have an end?Or what provokes you that you answer?"
18,16,4,"I also could speak as you do.If your soul were in my soul's place,I could join words together against you,and shake my head at you,"
18,16,5,"but I would strengthen you with my mouth.The solace of my lips would relieve you."
18,16,6,"Though I speak, my grief is not subsided.Though I forbear, what am I eased?"
18,16,7,"But now, God, you have surely worn me out.You have made desolate all my company."
18,16,8,"You have shriveled me up. This is a witness against me.My leanness rises up against me.It testifies to my face."
18,16,9,"He has torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me.He has gnashed on me with his teeth.My adversary sharpens his eyes on me."
18,16,10,"They have gaped on me with their mouth.They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully.They gather themselves together against me."
18,16,11,"God delivers me to the ungodly,and casts me into the hands of the wicked."
18,16,12,"I was at ease, and he broke me apart.Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces.He has also set me up for his target."
18,16,13,"His archers surround me.He splits my kidneys apart, and does not spare.He pours out my gall on the ground."
18,16,14,"He breaks me with breach on breach.He runs on me like a giant."
18,16,15,"I have sewed sackcloth on my skin,and have thrust my horn in the dust."
18,16,16,"My face is red with weeping.Deep darkness is on my eyelids."
18,16,17,"Although there is no violence in my hands,and my prayer is pure."
18,16,18,"Earth, do not cover my blood.Let my cry have no place to rest."
18,16,19,"Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven.He who vouches for me is on high."
18,16,20,"My friends scoff at me.My eyes pour out tears to God,"
18,16,21,"that he would maintain the right of a man with God,of a son of man with his neighbor!"
18,16,22,"For when a few years are come,I shall go the way from whence I shall not return."
18,17,1,"My spirit is consumed.My days are extinct,And the grave is ready for me."
18,17,2,"Surely there are mockers with me.My eye dwells on their provocation."
18,17,3,"Now give a pledge, be collateral for me with yourself.Who is there who will strike hands with me?"
18,17,4,"For you have hidden their heart from understanding,Therefore you shall not exalt them."
18,17,5,"He who denounces his friends for a prey,Even the eyes of his children shall fail."
18,17,6,"But he has made me a byword of the people.They spit in my face."
18,17,7,"My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow.All my members are as a shadow."
18,17,8,"Upright men shall be astonished at this.The innocent shall stir up himself against the godless."
18,17,9,"Yet shall the righteous hold on his way.He who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger."
18,17,10,"But as for you all, come on now again;I shall not find a wise man among you."
18,17,11,"My days are past, my plans are broken off,as are the thoughts of my heart."
18,17,12,"They change the night into day,saying 'The light is near' in the presence of darkness."
18,17,13,"If I look for Sheol as my house,if I have spread my couch in the darkness,"
18,17,14,"If I have said to corruption, 'You are my father;'to the worm, 'My mother,' and 'my sister;'"
18,17,15,"where then is my hope?As for my hope, who shall see it?"
18,17,16,"Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol,or descend together into the dust?"
18,18,1,"Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,"
18,18,2,"How long will you hunt for words?Consider, and afterwards we will speak."
18,18,3,"Why are we counted as animals,which have become unclean in your sight?"
18,18,4,"You who tear yourself in your anger,shall the earth be forsaken for you?Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?"
18,18,5,"Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out,The spark of his fire shall not shine."
18,18,6,"The light shall be dark in his tent.His lamp above him shall be put out."
18,18,7,"The steps of his strength shall be shortened.His own counsel shall cast him down."
18,18,8,"For he is cast into a net by his own feet,and he wanders into its mesh."
18,18,9,"A snare will take him by the heel.A trap will catch him."
18,18,10,"A noose is hidden for him in the ground,a trap for him in the way."
18,18,11,"Terrors shall make him afraid on every side,and shall chase him at his heels."
18,18,12,"His strength shall be famished.Calamity shall be ready at his side."
18,18,13,"The members of his body shall be devoured.The firstborn of death shall devour his members."
18,18,14,"He shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusts.He shall be brought to the king of terrors."
18,18,15,"There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his.Sulfur shall be scattered on his habitation."
18,18,16,"His roots shall be dried up beneath.Above shall his branch be cut off."
18,18,17,"His memory shall perish from the earth.He shall have no name in the street."
18,18,18,"He shall be driven from light into darkness,and chased out of the world."
18,18,19,"He shall have neither son nor grandson among his people,nor any remaining where he sojourned."
18,18,20,"Those who come after shall be astonished at his day,as those who went before were frightened."
18,18,21,"Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous.This is the place of him who doesn't know God."
18,19,1,"Then Job answered,"
18,19,2,"How long will you torment me,and crush me with words?"
18,19,3,"You have reproached me ten times.You aren't ashamed that you attack me."
18,19,4,"If it is true that I have erred,my error remains with myself."
18,19,5,"If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me,and plead against me my reproach;"
18,19,6,"know now that God has subverted me,and has surrounded me with his net."
18,19,7,"Behold, I cry out 'Injustice!' but there is no justice."
18,19,8,"He has walled up my way so that I can't pass,and has set darkness in my paths."
18,19,9,"He has stripped me of my glory,and taken the crown from my head."
18,19,10,"He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone.My hope he has plucked up like a tree."
18,19,11,"He has also kindled his wrath against me.He counts me among his adversaries."
18,19,12,"His troops come on together,build a siege ramp against me,and encamp around my tent."
18,19,13,"He has put my brothers far from me.My acquaintances are wholly estranged from me."
18,19,14,"My relatives have gone away.My familiar friends have forgotten me."
18,19,15,"Those who dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger.I am a foreigner in their sight."
18,19,16,"I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer.I beg him with my mouth."
18,19,17,"My breath is offensive to my wife.I am loathsome to the children of my own mother."
18,19,18,"Even young children despise me.If I arise, they speak against me."
18,19,19,"All my familiar friends abhor me.They whom I loved have turned against me."
18,19,20,"My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh.I have escaped by the skin of my teeth."
18,19,21,"Have pity on me, have pity on me, you my friends;for the hand of God has touched me."
18,19,22,"Why do you persecute me as God,and are not satisfied with my flesh?"
18,19,23,"Oh that my words were now written!Oh that they were inscribed in a book!"
18,19,24,"That with an iron pen and leadthey were engraved in the rock forever!"
18,19,25,"But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives.In the end, he will stand upon the earth."
18,19,26,"After my skin is destroyed,then in my flesh shall I see God,"
18,19,27,"Whom I, even I, shall see on my side.My eyes shall see, and not as a stranger.My heart is consumed within me."
18,19,28,"If you say, 'How we will persecute him!'because the root of the matter is found in me,"
18,19,29,"be afraid of the sword,for wrath brings the punishments of the sword,that you may know there is a judgment."
18,20,1,"Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,"
18,20,2,"Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me,even by reason of my haste that is in me."
18,20,3,"I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame.The spirit of my understanding answers me."
18,20,4,"Do you not know this from old time,since man was placed on earth,"
18,20,5,"that the triumphing of the wicked is short,the joy of the godless but for a moment?"
18,20,6,"Though his height mount up to the heavens,and his head reach to the clouds,"
18,20,7,"yet he shall perish forever like his own dung.Those who have seen him shall say, 'Where is he?'"
18,20,8,"He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found.Yes, he shall be chased away like a vision of the night."
18,20,9,"The eye which saw him shall see him no more,neither shall his place any more see him."
18,20,10,"His children shall seek the favor of the poor.His hands shall give back his wealth."
18,20,11,"His bones are full of his youth,but youth shall lie down with him in the dust."
18,20,12,"Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth,though he hide it under his tongue,"
18,20,13,"though he spare it, and will not let it go,but keep it still within his mouth;"
18,20,14,"yet his food in his bowels is turned.It is cobra venom within him."
18,20,15,"He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again.God will cast them out of his belly."
18,20,16,"He shall suck cobra venom.The viper's tongue shall kill him."
18,20,17,"He shall not look at the rivers,the flowing streams of honey and butter."
18,20,18,"That for which he labored he shall restore, and shall not swallow it down.According to the substance that he has gotten, he shall not rejoice."
18,20,19,"For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor.He has violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up."
18,20,20,"Because he knew no quietness within him,he shall not save anything of that in which he delights."
18,20,21,"There was nothing left that he did not devour,therefore his prosperity shall not endure."
18,20,22,"In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress shall overtake him.The hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him."
18,20,23,"When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him.It will rain on him while he is eating."
18,20,24,"He shall flee from the iron weapon.The bronze arrow shall strike him through."
18,20,25,"He draws it forth, and it comes out of his body.Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver.Terrors are on him."
18,20,26,"All darkness is laid up for his treasures.An unfanned fire shall devour him.It shall consume that which is left in his tent."
18,20,27,"The heavens shall reveal his iniquity.The earth shall rise up against him."
18,20,28,"The increase of his house shall depart.They shall rush away in the day of his wrath."
18,20,29,"This is the portion of a wicked man from God,the heritage appointed to him by God."
18,21,1,"Then Job answered,"
18,21,2,"Listen diligently to my speech.Let this be your consolation."
18,21,3,"Allow me, and I also will speak;After I have spoken, mock on."
18,21,4,"As for me, is my complaint to man?Why shouldn't I be impatient?"
18,21,5,"Look at me, and be astonished.Lay your hand on your mouth."
18,21,6,"When I remember, I am troubled.Horror takes hold of my flesh."
18,21,7,"Why do the wicked live,become old, yes, and grow mighty in power?"
18,21,8,"Their child is established with them in their sight,their offspring before their eyes."
18,21,9,"Their houses are safe from fear,neither is the rod of God upon them."
18,21,10,"Their bulls breed without fail.Their cows calve, and do not miscarry."
18,21,11,"They send forth their little ones like a flock.Their children dance."
18,21,12,"They sing to the tambourine and harp,and rejoice at the sound of the pipe."
18,21,13,"They spend their days in prosperity.In an instant they go down to Sheol."
18,21,14,"They tell God, 'Depart from us,for we do not want to know about your ways."
18,21,15,"What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?What profit should we have, if we pray to him?'"
18,21,16,"Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand.The counsel of the wicked is far from me."
18,21,17,"How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out,that their calamity comes on them,that God distributes sorrows in his anger?"
18,21,18,"How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind,as chaff that the storm carries away?"
18,21,19,"You say, 'God lays up his iniquity for his children.'Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it."
18,21,20,"Let his own eyes see his destruction.Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty."
18,21,21,"For what does he care for his house after him,when the number of his months is cut off?"
18,21,22,"Shall any teach God knowledge,seeing he judges those who are high?"
18,21,23,"One dies in his full strength,being wholly at ease and quiet."
18,21,24,"His pails are full of milk.The marrow of his bones is moistened."
18,21,25,"Another dies in bitterness of soul,and never tastes of good."
18,21,26,"They lie down alike in the dust.The worm covers them."
18,21,27,"Behold, I know your thoughts,the devices with which you would wrong me."
18,21,28,"For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince?Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?'"
18,21,29,"Haven't you asked wayfaring men?Do you not know their evidences,"
18,21,30,"that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity,That they are led forth to the day of wrath?"
18,21,31,"Who shall declare his way to his face?Who shall repay him what he has done?"
18,21,32,"Yet he will be borne to the grave.Men shall keep watch over the tomb."
18,21,33,"The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him.All men shall draw after him,as there were innumerable before him."
18,21,34,"So how can you comfort me with nonsense,seeing that in your answers there remains only falsehood?"
18,22,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,"
18,22,2,"Can a man be profitable to God?Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself."
18,22,3,"Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous?Or does it benefit him, that you make your ways perfect?"
18,22,4,"Is it for your piety that he reproves you,that he enters with you into judgment?"
18,22,5,"Isn't your wickedness great?Neither is there any end to your iniquities."
18,22,6,"For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing,and stripped the naked of their clothing."
18,22,7,"You haven't given water to the weary to drink,and you have withheld bread from the hungry."
18,22,8,"But as for the mighty man, he had the earth.The honorable man, he lived in it."
18,22,9,"You have sent widows away empty,and the arms of the fatherless have been broken."
18,22,10,"Therefore snares are around you.Sudden fear troubles you,"
18,22,11,"or darkness, so that you can not see,and floods of waters cover you."
18,22,12,"Isn't God in the heights of heaven?See the height of the stars, how high they are!"
18,22,13,"You say, 'What does God know?Can he judge through the thick darkness?"
18,22,14,"Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn't see.He walks on the vault of the sky.'"
18,22,15,"Will you keep the old way,which wicked men have trodden,"
18,22,16,"who were snatched away before their time,whose foundation was poured out as a stream,"
18,22,17,"who said to God, 'Depart from us;'and, 'What can the Almighty do for us?'"
18,22,18,"Yet he filled their houses with good things,but the counsel of the wicked is far from me."
18,22,19,"The righteous see it, and are glad.The innocent ridicule them,"
18,22,20,"saying, 'Surely those who rose up against us are cut off.The fire has consumed the remnant of them.'"
18,22,21,"Acquaint yourself with him, now, and be at peace.Thereby good shall come to you."
18,22,22,"Please receive instruction from his mouth,and lay up his words in your heart."
18,22,23,"If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up,if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents."
18,22,24,"Lay your treasure in the dust,the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks."
18,22,25,"The Almighty will be your treasure,and precious silver to you."
18,22,26,"For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty,and shall lift up your face to God."
18,22,27,"You shall make your prayer to him, and he will hear you.You shall pay your vows."
18,22,28,"You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established to you.Light shall shine on your ways."
18,22,29,"When they cast down, you shall say, 'be lifted up.'He will save the humble person."
18,22,30,"He will even deliver him who is not innocent.Yes, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."
18,23,1,"Then Job answered,"
18,23,2,"Even today my complaint is rebellious.His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning."
18,23,3,"Oh that I knew where I might find him!That I might come even to his seat!"
18,23,4,"I would set my cause in order before him,and fill my mouth with arguments."
18,23,5,"I would know the words which he would answer me,and understand what he would tell me."
18,23,6,"Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?No, but he would listen to me."
18,23,7,"There the upright might reason with him,so I should be delivered forever from my judge."
18,23,8,"If I go east, he is not there;if west, I can't find him;"
18,23,9,"He works to the north, but I can't see him.He turns south, but I can't catch a glimpse of him."
18,23,10,"But he knows the way that I take.When he has tried me, I shall come forth like gold."
18,23,11,"My foot has held fast to his steps.I have kept his way, and not turned aside."
18,23,12,"I haven't gone back from the commandment of his lips.I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food."
18,23,13,"But he stands alone, and who can oppose him?What his soul desires, even that he does."
18,23,14,"For he performs that which is appointed for me.Many such things are with him."
18,23,15,"Therefore I am terrified at his presence.When I consider, I am afraid of him."
18,23,16,"For God has made my heart faint.The Almighty has terrified me."
18,23,17,"Because I was not cut off before the darkness,neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face."
18,24,1,"Why aren't times laid up by the Almighty?Why do not those who know him see his days?"
18,24,2,"There are people who remove the landmarks.They violently take away flocks, and feed them."
18,24,3,"They drive away the donkey of the fatherless,and they take the widow's ox for a pledge."
18,24,4,"They turn the needy out of the way.The poor of the earth all hide themselves."
18,24,5,"Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert,they go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food.The wilderness yields them bread for their children."
18,24,6,"They cut their provender in the field.They glean the vineyard of the wicked."
18,24,7,"They lie all night naked without clothing,and have no covering in the cold."
18,24,8,"They are wet with the showers of the mountains,and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter."
18,24,9,"There are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast,and take a pledge of the poor,"
18,24,10,"So that they go around naked without clothing.Being hungry, they carry the sheaves."
18,24,11,"They make oil within the walls of these men.They tread wine presses, and suffer thirst."
18,24,12,"From out of the populous city, men groan.The soul of the wounded cries out,yet God doesn't regard the folly."
18,24,13,"These are of those who rebel against the light.They do not know its ways,nor abide in its paths."
18,24,14,"The murderer rises with the light.He kills the poor and needy.In the night he is like a thief."
18,24,15,"The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight,saying, 'No eye shall see me.'He disguises his face."
18,24,16,"In the dark they dig through houses.They shut themselves up in the daytime.They do not know the light."
18,24,17,"For the morning is to all of them like thick darkness,for they know the terrors of the thick darkness."
18,24,18,"They are foam on the surface of the waters.Their portion is cursed in the earth.They do not turn into the way of the vineyards."
18,24,19,"Drought and heat consume the snow waters,so does Sheol those who have sinned."
18,24,20,"The womb shall forget him.The worm shall feed sweetly on him.He shall be no more remembered.Unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree."
18,24,21,"He devours the barren who do not bear.He shows no kindness to the widow."
18,24,22,"Yet God preserves the mighty by his power.He rises up who has no assurance of life."
18,24,23,"God gives them security, and they rest in it.His eyes are on their ways."
18,24,24,"They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone.Yes, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others,and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain."
18,24,25,"If it isn't so now, who will prove me a liar,and make my speech worth nothing?"
18,25,1,"Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,"
18,25,2,"Dominion and fear are with him.He makes peace in his high places."
18,25,3,"Can his armies be counted?On whom does his light not arise?"
18,25,4,"How then can man be just with God?Or how can he who is born of a woman be clean?"
18,25,5,"Behold, even the moon has no brightness,and the stars are not pure in his sight;"
18,25,6,"How much less man, who is a worm,the son of man, who is a worm!"
18,26,1,"Then Job answered,"
18,26,2,"How have you helped him who is without power!How have you saved the arm that has no strength!"
18,26,3,"How have you counseled him who has no wisdom,and plentifully declared sound knowledge!"
18,26,4,"To whom have you uttered words?Whose spirit came forth from you?"
18,26,5,"Those who are deceased tremble,those beneath the waters and all that live in them."
18,26,6,"Sheol is naked before God,and Abaddon has no covering."
18,26,7,"He stretches out the north over empty space,and hangs the earth on nothing."
18,26,8,"He binds up the waters in his thick clouds,and the cloud is not burst under them."
18,26,9,"He encloses the face of his throne,and spreads his cloud on it."
18,26,10,"He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters,and to the confines of light and darkness."
18,26,11,"The pillars of heaven trembleand are astonished at his rebuke."
18,26,12,"He stirs up the sea with his power,and by his understanding he strikes through Rahab."
18,26,13,"By his Spirit the heavens are garnished.His hand has pierced the swift serpent."
18,26,14,"Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways.How small a whisper do we hear of him!But the thunder of his power who can understand?"
18,27,1,"Job again took up his parable, and said,"
18,27,2,"As God lives, who has taken away my right,the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter."
18,27,3,"(For the length of my life is still in me,and the spirit of God is in my nostrils);"
18,27,4,"surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness,neither shall my tongue utter deceit."
18,27,5,"Far be it from me that I should justify you.Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me."
18,27,6,"I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go.My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live."
18,27,7,"Let my enemy be as the wicked.Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous."
18,27,8,"For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?"
18,27,9,"Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?"
18,27,10,"Will he delight himself in the Almighty,and call on God at all times?"
18,27,11,"I will teach you about the hand of God.That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal."
18,27,12,"Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves;why then have you become altogether vain?"
18,27,13,"This is the portion of a wicked man with God,the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty."
18,27,14,"If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword.His offspring shall not be satisfied with bread."
18,27,15,"Those who remain of him shall be buried in death.His widows shall make no lamentation."
18,27,16,"Though he heap up silver as the dust,and prepare clothing as the clay;"
18,27,17,"he may prepare it, but the just shall put it on,and the innocent shall divide the silver."
18,27,18,"He builds his house as the moth,as a booth which the watchman makes."
18,27,19,"He lies down rich, but he shall not do so again.He opens his eyes, and he is not."
18,27,20,"Terrors overtake him like waters.A storm steals him away in the night."
18,27,21,"The east wind carries him away, and he departs.It sweeps him out of his place."
18,27,22,"For it hurls at him, and does not spare,as he flees away from his hand."
18,27,23,"Men shall clap their hands at him,and shall hiss him out of his place."
18,28,1,"Surely there is a mine for silver,and a place for gold which they refine."
18,28,2,"Iron is taken out of the earth,and copper is smelted out of the ore."
18,28,3,"Man sets an end to darkness,and searches out, to the furthest bound,the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness."
18,28,4,"He breaks open a shaft away from where people live.They are forgotten by the foot.They hang far from men, they swing back and forth."
18,28,5,"As for the earth, out of it comes bread;Underneath it is turned up as it were by fire."
18,28,6,"Sapphires come from its rocks.It has dust of gold."
18,28,7,"That path no bird of prey knows,neither has the falcon's eye seen it."
18,28,8,"The proud animals have not trodden it,nor has the fierce lion passed by there."
18,28,9,"He puts forth his hand on the flinty rock,and he overturns the mountains by the roots."
18,28,10,"He cuts out channels among the rocks.His eye sees every precious thing."
18,28,11,"He binds the streams that they do not trickle.The thing that is hidden he brings forth to light."
18,28,12,"But where shall wisdom be found?Where is the place of understanding?"
18,28,13,"Man doesn't know its price;Neither is it found in the land of the living."
18,28,14,"The deep says, 'It isn't in me.'The sea says, 'It isn't with me.'"
18,28,15,"It can't be gotten for gold,neither shall silver be weighed for its price."
18,28,16,"It can't be valued with the gold of Ophir,with the precious onyx, or the sapphire."
18,28,17,"Gold and glass can't equal it,neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold."
18,28,18,"No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal.Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies."
18,28,19,"The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,Neither shall it be valued with pure gold."
18,28,20,"Whence then comes wisdom?Where is the place of understanding?"
18,28,21,"Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living,and kept close from the birds of the sky."
18,28,22,"Destruction and Death say,'We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.'"
18,28,23,"God understands its way,and he knows its place."
18,28,24,"For he looks to the ends of the earth,and sees under the whole sky."
18,28,25,"He establishes the force of the wind.Yes, he measures out the waters by measure."
18,28,26,"When he made a decree for the rain,and a way for the lightning of the thunder;"
18,28,27,"then he saw it, and declared it.He established it, yes, and searched it out."
18,28,28,"To man he said,'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.To depart from evil is understanding.'"
18,29,1,"Job again took up his parable, and said,"
18,29,2,"Oh that I were as in the months of old,as in the days when God watched over me;"
18,29,3,"when his lamp shone on my head,and by his light I walked through darkness,"
18,29,4,"as I was in the ripeness of my days,when the friendship of God was in my tent,"
18,29,5,"when the Almighty was yet with me,and my children were around me,"
18,29,6,"when my steps were washed with butter,and the rock poured out streams of oil for me,"
18,29,7,"when I went forth to the city gate,when I prepared my seat in the street."
18,29,8,"The young men saw me and hid themselves.The aged rose up and stood."
18,29,9,"The princes refrained from talking,and laid their hand on their mouth."
18,29,10,"The voice of the nobles was hushed,and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth."
18,29,11,"For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me;and when the eye saw me, it commended me:"
18,29,12,"Because I delivered the poor who cried,and the fatherless also, who had none to help him,"
18,29,13,"the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me,and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy."
18,29,14,"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me.My justice was as a robe and a diadem."
18,29,15,"I was eyes to the blind,and feet to the lame."
18,29,16,"I was a father to the needy.The cause of him who I did not know, I searched out."
18,29,17,"I broke the jaws of the unrighteous,and plucked the prey out of his teeth."
18,29,18,"Then I said, 'I shall die in my own house,I shall number my days as the sand."
18,29,19,"My root is spread out to the waters.The dew lies all night on my branch."
18,29,20,"My glory is fresh in me.My bow is renewed in my hand.'"
18,29,21,"Men listened to me, waited,and kept silence for my counsel."
18,29,22,"After my words they did not speak again.My speech fell on them."
18,29,23,"They waited for me as for the rain.Their mouths drank as with the spring rain."
18,29,24,"I smiled on them when they had no confidence.They did not reject the light of my face."
18,29,25,"I chose out their way, and sat as chief.I lived as a king in the army,as one who comforts the mourners."
18,30,1,"But now those who are younger than I have me in derision,whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs."
18,30,2,"Of what use is the strength of their hands to me,men in whom ripe age has perished?"
18,30,3,"They are gaunt from lack and famine.They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation."
18,30,4,"They pluck salt herbs by the bushes.The roots of the broom are their food."
18,30,5,"They are driven out from the midst of men.They cry after them as after a thief;"
18,30,6,"So that they dwell in frightful valleys,and in holes of the earth and of the rocks."
18,30,7,"Among the bushes they bray;and under the nettles they are gathered together."
18,30,8,"They are children of fools, yes, children of base men.They were flogged out of the land."
18,30,9,"Now I have become their song.Yes, I am a byword to them."
18,30,10,"They abhor me, they stand aloof from me,and do not hesitate to spit in my face."
18,30,11,"For he has untied his cord, and afflicted me;and they have thrown off restraint before me."
18,30,12,"On my right hand rise the rabble.They thrust aside my feet,They cast up against me their ways of destruction."
18,30,13,"They mar my path,They set forward my calamity,without anyone's help."
18,30,14,"As through a wide breach they come,in the midst of the ruin they roll themselves in."
18,30,15,"Terrors have turned on me.They chase my honor as the wind.My welfare has passed away as a cloud."
18,30,16,"Now my soul is poured out within me.Days of affliction have taken hold on me."
18,30,17,"In the night season my bones are pierced in me,and the pains that gnaw me take no rest."
18,30,18,"By great force is my garment disfigured.It binds me about as the collar of my coat."
18,30,19,"He has cast me into the mire.I have become like dust and ashes."
18,30,20,"I cry to you, and you do not answer me.I stand up, and you gaze at me."
18,30,21,"You have turned to be cruel to me.With the might of your hand you persecute me."
18,30,22,"You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it.You dissolve me in the storm."
18,30,23,"For I know that you will bring me to death,To the house appointed for all living."
18,30,24,"However doesn't one stretch out a hand in his fall?Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?"
18,30,25,"Did I not weep for him who was in trouble?Wasn't my soul grieved for the needy?"
18,30,26,"When I looked for good, then evil came;When I waited for light, there came darkness."
18,30,27,"My heart is troubled, and doesn't rest.Days of affliction have come on me."
18,30,28,"I go mourning without the sun.I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help."
18,30,29,"I am a brother to jackals,and a companion to ostriches."
18,30,30,"My skin grows black and peels from me.My bones are burned with heat."
18,30,31,"Therefore my harp has turned to mourning,and my pipe into the voice of those who weep."
18,31,1,"I made a covenant with my eyes,how then should I look lustfully at a young woman?"
18,31,2,"For what is the portion from God above,and the heritage from the Almighty on high?"
18,31,3,"Is it not calamity for the unrighteous,and disaster for the workers of iniquity?"
18,31,4,"Doesn't he see my ways,and number all my steps?"
18,31,5,"If I have walked with falsehood,and my foot has hurried to deceit"
18,31,6,"(let me be weighed in an even balance,that God may know my integrity);"
18,31,7,"if my step has turned out of the way,if my heart walked after my eyes,if any defilement has stuck to my hands,"
18,31,8,"then let me sow, and let another eat.Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out."
18,31,9,"If my heart has been enticed to a woman,and I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door,"
18,31,10,"then let my wife grind for another,and let others sleep with her."
18,31,11,"For that would be a heinous crime.Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges:"
18,31,12,"For it is a fire that consumes to destruction,and would root out all my increase."
18,31,13,"If I have despised the cause of my male servantor of my female servant,when they contended with me;"
18,31,14,"What then shall I do when God rises up?When he visits, what shall I answer him?"
18,31,15,"Did not he who made me in the womb make him?Did not the same one fashion us in the womb?"
18,31,16,"If I have withheld the poor from their desire,or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,"
18,31,17,"or have eaten my morsel alone,and the fatherless has not eaten of it"
18,31,18,"(no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,her have I guided from my mother's womb);"
18,31,19,"if I have seen any perish for want of clothing,or that the needy had no covering;"
18,31,20,"if his heart hasn't blessed me,if he hasn't been warmed with my sheep's fleece;"
18,31,21,"if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,because I saw my help in the gate,"
18,31,22,"then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade,and my arm be broken from the bone."
18,31,23,"For calamity from God is a terror to me.Because his majesty, I can do nothing."
18,31,24,"If I have made gold my hope,and have said to the fine gold, 'You are my confidence;'"
18,31,25,"If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,and because my hand had gotten much;"
18,31,26,"if I have seen the sun when it shined,or the moon moving in splendor,"
18,31,27,"and my heart has been secretly enticed,and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,"
18,31,28,"this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges;for I should have denied the God who is above."
18,31,29,"If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me,or lifted up myself when evil found him;"
18,31,30,"(yes, I have not allowed my mouth to sinby asking his life with a curse);"
18,31,31,"if the men of my tent have not said,'Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?'"
18,31,32,"(the foreigner has not lodged in the street,but I have opened my doors to the traveler);"
18,31,33,"if like Adam I have covered my transgressions,by hiding my iniquity in my heart,"
18,31,34,"because I feared the great multitude,and the contempt of families terrified me,so that I kept silence, and did not go out of the door-"
18,31,35,"oh that I had one to hear me!(behold, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me);let the accuser write my indictment!"
18,31,36,"Surely I would carry it on my shoulder;and I would bind it to me as a crown."
18,31,37,"I would declare to him the number of my steps;as a prince would I go near to him."
18,31,38,"If my land cries out against me,and its furrows weep together;"
18,31,39,"if I have eaten its fruits without money,or have caused its owners to lose their life,"
18,31,40,"let briars grow instead of wheat,and stinkweed instead of barley.The words of Job are ended."
18,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
18,32,2,"Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job. His wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God."
18,32,3,"Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job."
18,32,4,"Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were elder than he."
18,32,5,"When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled."
18,32,6,"Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered,I am young, and you are very old;Therefore I held back, and did not dare show you my opinion."
18,32,7,"I said, 'Days should speak,and multitude of years should teach wisdom.'"
18,32,8,"But there is a spirit in man,and the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding."
18,32,9,"It is not the great who are wise,nor the aged who understand justice."
18,32,10,"Therefore I said, 'Listen to me;I also will show my opinion.'"
18,32,11,"Behold, I waited for your words,and I listened for your reasoning,while you searched out what to say."
18,32,12,"Yes, I gave you my full attention,but there was no one who convinced Job,or who answered his words, among you."
18,32,13,"Beware lest you say, 'We have found wisdom,God may refute him, not man;'"
18,32,14,"for he has not directed his words against me;neither will I answer him with your speeches."
18,32,15,"They are amazed. They answer no more.They do not have a word to say."
18,32,16,"Shall I wait, because they do not speak,because they stand still, and answer no more?"
18,32,17,"I also will answer my part,and I also will show my opinion."
18,32,18,"For I am full of words.The spirit within me constrains me."
18,32,19,"Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent;like new wineskins it is ready to burst."
18,32,20,"I will speak, that I may be refreshed.I will open my lips and answer."
18,32,21,"Please do not let me respect any man's person,neither will I give flattering titles to any man."
18,32,22,"For I do not know how to give flattering titles;or else my Maker would soon take me away."
18,33,1,"However, Job, Please hear my speech,and listen to all my words."
18,33,2,"See now, I have opened my mouth.My tongue has spoken in my mouth."
18,33,3,"My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart.That which my lips know they shall speak sincerely."
18,33,4,"The Spirit of God has made me,and the breath of the Almighty gives me life."
18,33,5,"If you can, answer me.Set your words in order before me, and stand forth."
18,33,6,"Behold, I am toward God even as you are.I am also formed out of the clay."
18,33,7,"Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid,neither shall my pressure be heavy on you."
18,33,8,"Surely you have spoken in my hearing,I have heard the voice of your words, saying,"
18,33,9,"'I am clean, without disobedience.I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me."
18,33,10,"Behold, he finds occasions against me.He counts me for his enemy."
18,33,11,"He puts my feet in the stocks.He marks all my paths.'"
18,33,12,"Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just,for God is greater than man."
18,33,13,"Why do you strive against him,because he doesn't give account of any of his matters?"
18,33,14,"For God speaks once,yes twice, though man pays no attention."
18,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night,when deep sleep falls on men,in slumbering on the bed;"
18,33,16,"Then he opens the ears of men,and seals their instruction,"
18,33,17,"That he may withdraw man from his purpose,and hide pride from man."
18,33,18,"He keeps back his soul from the pit,and his life from perishing by the sword."
18,33,19,"He is chastened also with pain on his bed,with continual strife in his bones;"
18,33,20,"So that his life abhors bread,and his soul dainty food."
18,33,21,"His flesh is so consumed away, that it can't be seen.His bones that were not seen stick out."
18,33,22,"Yes, his soul draws near to the pit,and his life to the destroyers."
18,33,23,"If there is beside him an angel,an interpreter, one among a thousand,to show to man what is right for him;"
18,33,24,"then God is gracious to him, and says,'Deliver him from going down to the pit,I have found a ransom.'"
18,33,25,"His flesh shall be fresher than a child's.He returns to the days of his youth."
18,33,26,"He prays to God, and he is favorable to him,so that he sees his face with joy.He restores to man his righteousness."
18,33,27,"He sings before men, and says,'I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,and it did not profit me."
18,33,28,"He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit.My life shall see the light.'"
18,33,29,"Behold, God works all these things,twice, yes three times, with a man,"
18,33,30,"to bring back his soul from the pit,that he may be enlightened with the light of the living."
18,33,31,"Mark well, Job, and listen to me.Hold your peace, and I will speak."
18,33,32,"If you have anything to say, answer me.Speak, for I desire to justify you."
18,33,33,"If not, listen to me.Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom."
18,34,1,"Moreover Elihu answered,"
18,34,2,"Hear my words, you wise men.Give ear to me, you who have knowledge."
18,34,3,"For the ear tries words,as the palate tastes food."
18,34,4,"Let us choose for us that which is right.Let us know among ourselves what is good."
18,34,5,"For Job has said, 'I am righteous,God has taken away my right:"
18,34,6,"Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar.My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.'"
18,34,7,"What man is like Job,who drinks scorn like water,"
18,34,8,"Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,and walks with wicked men?"
18,34,9,"For he has said, 'It profits a man nothingthat he should delight himself with God.'"
18,34,10,"Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity."
18,34,11,"For the work of a man he will render to him,and cause every man to find according to his ways."
18,34,12,"Yes surely, God will not do wickedly,neither will the Almighty pervert justice."
18,34,13,"Who put him in charge of the earth?or who has appointed him over the whole world?"
18,34,14,"If he set his heart on himself,If he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath,"
18,34,15,"all flesh would perish together,and man would turn again to dust."
18,34,16,"If now you have understanding, hear this.Listen to the voice of my words."
18,34,17,"Shall even one who hates justice govern?Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?-"
18,34,18,"Who says to a king, 'Vile!'or to nobles, 'Wicked!'?"
18,34,19,"Who doesn't respect the persons of princes,nor regards the rich more than the poor;for they all are the work of his hands."
18,34,20,"In a moment they die, even at midnight.The people are shaken and pass away.The mighty are taken away without a hand."
18,34,21,"For his eyes are on the ways of a man.He sees all his goings."
18,34,22,"There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves."
18,34,23,"For he doesn't need to consider a man further,that he should go before God in judgment."
18,34,24,"He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out,and sets others in their place."
18,34,25,"Therefore he takes knowledge of their works.He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed."
18,34,26,"He strikes them as wicked menin the open sight of others;"
18,34,27,"because they turned aside from following him,and wouldn't pay attention to any of his ways,"
18,34,28,"so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him.He heard the cry of the afflicted."
18,34,29,"When he gives quietness, who then can condemn?When he hides his face, who then can see him?Alike whether to a nation, or to a man,"
18,34,30,"that the godless man may not reign,that there be no one to ensnare the people."
18,34,31,"For has any said to God,'I am guilty, but I will not offend any more."
18,34,32,"Teach me that which I do not see.If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more'?"
18,34,33,"Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it?For you must choose, and not I.Therefore speak what you know."
18,34,34,"Men of understanding will tell me,yes, every wise man who hears me:"
18,34,35,"'Job speaks without knowledge.His words are without wisdom.'"
18,34,36,"I wish that Job were tried to the end,because of his answering like wicked men."
18,34,37,"For he adds rebellion to his sin.He claps his hands among us,and multiplies his words against God."
18,35,1,"Moreover Elihu answered,"
18,35,2,"Do you think this to be your right,or do you say, 'My righteousness is more than God's,'"
18,35,3,"That you ask, 'What advantage will it be to you?What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?'"
18,35,4,"I will answer you,and your companions with you."
18,35,5,"Look to the heavens, and see.See the skies, which are higher than you."
18,35,6,"If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him?If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?"
18,35,7,"If you are righteous, what do you give him?Or what does he receive from your hand?"
18,35,8,"Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are,and your righteousness may profit a son of man."
18,35,9,"By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out.They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty."
18,35,10,"But none says, 'Where is God my Maker,who gives songs in the night,"
18,35,11,"who teaches us more than the animals of the earth,and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?'"
18,35,12,"There they cry, but none gives answer,because of the pride of evil men."
18,35,13,"Surely God will not hear an empty cry,neither will the Almighty regard it."
18,35,14,"How much less when you say you do not see him.The cause is before him, and you wait for him!"
18,35,15,"But now, because he has not visited in his anger,neither does he greatly regard arrogance."
18,35,16,"Therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk,and he multiplies words without knowledge."
18,36,1,"Elihu also continued, and said,"
18,36,2,"Bear with me a little, and I will show you;for I still have something to say on God's behalf."
18,36,3,"I will get my knowledge from afar,and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker."
18,36,4,"For truly my words are not false.One who is perfect in knowledge is with you."
18,36,5,"Behold, God is mighty, and doesn't despise anyone.He is mighty in strength of understanding."
18,36,6,"He doesn't preserve the life of the wicked,but gives to the afflicted their right."
18,36,7,"He doesn't withdraw his eyes from the righteous,but with kings on the throne,he sets them forever, and they are exalted."
18,36,8,"If they are bound in fetters,and are taken in the cords of afflictions,"
18,36,9,"then he shows them their work,and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly."
18,36,10,"He also opens their ears to instruction,and commands that they return from iniquity."
18,36,11,"If they listen and serve him,they shall spend their days in prosperity,and their years in pleasures."
18,36,12,"But if they do not listen, they shall perish by the sword;they shall die without knowledge."
18,36,13,"But those who are godless in heart lay up anger.They do not cry for help when he binds them."
18,36,14,"They die in youth.Their life perishes among the unclean."
18,36,15,"He delivers the afflicted by their affliction,and opens their ear in oppression."
18,36,16,"Yes, he would have allured you out of distress,into a broad place, where there is no restriction.That which is set on your table would be full of fatness."
18,36,17,"But you are full of the judgment of the wicked.Judgment and justice take hold of you."
18,36,18,"Do not let riches entice you to wrath,neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside."
18,36,19,"Would your wealth sustain you in distress,or all the might of your strength?"
18,36,20,"Do not desire the night,when people are cut off in their place."
18,36,21,"Take heed, do not regard iniquity;for you have chosen this rather than affliction."
18,36,22,"Behold, God is exalted in his power.Who is a teacher like him?"
18,36,23,"Who has prescribed his way for him?Or who can say, 'You have committed unrighteousness?'"
18,36,24,"Remember that you magnify his work,whereof men have sung."
18,36,25,"All men have looked thereon.Man sees it afar off."
18,36,26,"Behold, God is great, and we do not know him.The number of his years is unsearchable."
18,36,27,"For he draws up the drops of water,which distill in rain from his vapor,"
18,36,28,"Which the skies pour downand which drop on man abundantly."
18,36,29,"Yes, can any understand the spreading of the clouds,and the thunderings of his pavilion?"
18,36,30,"Behold, he spreads his light around him.He covers the bottom of the sea."
18,36,31,"For by these he judges the people.He gives food in abundance."
18,36,32,"He covers his hands with the lightning,and commands it to strike the mark."
18,36,33,"Its noise tells about him,and the livestock also concerning the storm that comes up."
18,37,1,"Yes, at this my heart trembles,and is moved out of its place."
18,37,2,"Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice,the sound that goes out of his mouth."
18,37,3,"He sends it forth under the whole sky,and his lightning to the ends of the earth."
18,37,4,"After it a voice roars.He thunders with the voice of his majesty.He doesn't hold back anything when his voice is heard."
18,37,5,"God thunders marvelously with his voice.He does great things, which we can't comprehend."
18,37,6,"For he says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth;'likewise to the shower of rain,and to the showers of his mighty rain."
18,37,7,"He seals up the hand of every man,that all men whom he has made may know it."
18,37,8,"Then the animals take cover,and remain in their dens."
18,37,9,"Out of its chamber comes the storm,and cold out of the north."
18,37,10,"By the breath of God, ice is given,and the breadth of the waters is frozen."
18,37,11,"Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture.He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning."
18,37,12,"It is turned around by his guidance,that they may do whatever he commands themon the surface of the habitable world,"
18,37,13,"Whether it is for correction, or for his land,or for loving kindness, that he causes it to come."
18,37,14,"Listen to this, Job.Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God."
18,37,15,"Do you know how God controls them,and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?"
18,37,16,"Do you know the workings of the clouds,the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?"
18,37,17,"You whose clothing is warm,when the earth is still by reason of the south wind?"
18,37,18,"Can you, with him, spread out the sky,which is strong as a cast metal mirror?"
18,37,19,"Teach us what we shall tell him,for we can't make our case by reason of darkness."
18,37,20,"Shall it be told him that I would speak?Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?"
18,37,21,"Now men do not see the light which is bright in the skies,but the wind passes, and clears them."
18,37,22,"Out of the north comes golden splendor.With God is awesome majesty."
18,37,23,"We can't reach the Almighty.He is exalted in power.In justice and great righteousness, he will not oppress."
18,37,24,"Therefore men revere him.He doesn't regard any who are wise of heart."
18,38,1,"Then the"
18,38,2,"Who is this who darkens counselby words without knowledge?"
18,38,3,"Brace yourself like a man,for I will question you, then you answer me!"
18,38,4,"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?Declare, if you have understanding."
18,38,5,"Who determined its measures, if you know?Or who stretched the line on it?"
18,38,6,"Whereupon were its foundations fastened?Or who laid its cornerstone,"
18,38,7,"when the morning stars sang together,and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"
18,38,8,"Or who shut up the sea with doors,when it broke forth from the womb,"
18,38,9,"when I made clouds its garment,and wrapped it in thick darkness,"

18,39,12,"Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed,and gather the grain of your threshing floor?"
18,39,13,"The wings of the ostrich wave proudly;but are they the feathers and plumage of love?"
18,39,14,"For she leaves her eggs on the earth,warms them in the dust,"
18,39,15,"and forgets that the foot may crush them,or that the wild animal may trample them."
18,39,16,"She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers.Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear,"
18,39,17,"because God has deprived her of wisdom,neither has he imparted to her understanding."
18,39,18,"When she lifts up herself on high,she scorns the horse and his rider."
18,39,19,"Have you given the horse might?Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane?"
18,39,20,"Have you made him to leap as a locust?The glory of his snorting is awesome."
18,39,21,"He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength.He goes out to meet the armed men."
18,39,22,"He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed,neither does he turn back from the sword."
18,39,23,"The quiver rattles against him,the flashing spear and the javelin."
18,39,24,"He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage,neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet."
18,39,25,"As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, 'Aha!'He smells the battle afar off,the thunder of the captains, and the shouting."
18,39,26,"Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars,and stretches her wings toward the south?"
18,39,27,"Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up,and makes his nest on high?"
18,39,28,"On the cliff he dwells, and makes his home,on the point of the cliff, and the stronghold."
18,39,29,"From there he spies out the prey.His eyes see it afar off."
18,39,30,"His young ones also suck up blood.Where the slain are, there he is."

18,40,10,"Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity.Array yourself with honor and majesty."
18,40,11,"Pour out the fury of your anger.Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low."
18,40,12,"Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him.Crush the wicked in their place."
18,40,13,"Hide them in the dust together.Bind their faces in the hidden place."
18,40,14,"Then I will also admit to youthat your own right hand can save you."
18,40,15,"See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you.He eats grass as an ox."
18,40,16,"Look now, his strength is in his thighs.His force is in the muscles of his belly."
18,40,17,"He moves his tail like a cedar.The sinews of his thighs are knit together."
18,40,18,"His bones are like tubes of brass.His limbs are like bars of iron."
18,40,19,"He is the chief of the ways of God.He who made him gives him his sword."
18,40,20,"Surely the mountains produce food for him,where all the animals of the field play."
18,40,21,"He lies under the lotus trees,in the covert of the reed, and the marsh."
18,40,22,"The lotuses cover him with their shade.The willows of the brook surround him."
18,40,23,"Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn't tremble.He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth."
18,40,24,"Shall any take him when he is on the watch,or pierce through his nose with a snare?"
18,41,1,"Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook,or press down his tongue with a cord?"
18,41,2,"Can you put a rope into his nose,or pierce his jaw through with a hook?"
18,41,3,"Will he make many petitions to you,or will he speak soft words to you?"
18,41,4,"Will he make a covenant with you,that you should take him for a servant forever?"
18,41,5,"Will you play with him as with a bird?Or will you bind him for your girls?"
18,41,6,"Will traders barter for him?Will they part him among the merchants?"
18,41,7,"Can you fill his skin with barbed irons,or his head with fish spears?"
18,41,8,"Lay your hand on him.Remember the battle, and do so no more."
18,41,9,"Behold, the hope of him is in vain.Won't one be cast down even at the sight of him?"
18,41,10,"None is so fierce that he dare stir him up.Who then is he who can stand before me?"
18,41,11,"Who has first given to me, that I should repay him?Everything under the heavens is mine."
18,41,12,"I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame."
18,41,13,"Who can strip off his outer garment?Who shall come within his jaws?"
18,41,14,"Who can open the doors of his face?Around his teeth is terror."
18,41,15,"Strong scales are his pride,shut up together with a close seal."
18,41,16,"One is so near to another,that no air can come between them."
18,41,17,"They are joined one to another.They stick together, so that they can't be pulled apart."
18,41,18,"His sneezing flashes out light.His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning."
18,41,19,"Out of his mouth go burning torches.Sparks of fire leap forth."
18,41,20,"Out of his nostrils a smoke goes,as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds."
18,41,21,"His breath kindles coals.A flame goes forth from his mouth."
18,41,22,"There is strength in his neck.Terror dances before him."
18,41,23,"The flakes of his flesh are joined together.They are firm on him.They can't be moved."
18,41,24,"His heart is as firm as a stone,yes, firm as the lower millstone."
18,41,25,"When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid.They retreat before his thrashing."
18,41,26,"If one attacks him with the sword, it can't prevail;nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft."
18,41,27,"He counts iron as straw;and brass as rotten wood."
18,41,28,"The arrow can't make him flee.Sling stones are like chaff to him."
18,41,29,"Clubs are counted as stubble.He laughs at the rushing of the javelin."
18,41,30,"His undersides are like sharp potsherds,leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge."
18,41,31,"He makes the deep to boil like a pot.He makes the sea like a pot of ointment."
18,41,32,"He makes a path shine after him.One would think the deep had white hair."
18,41,33,"On earth there is not his equal,that is made without fear."
18,41,34,"He sees everything that is high.He is king over all the sons of pride."
18,42,1,"Then Job answered the"

18,42,4,"You said, 'Listen, now, and I will speak;I will question you, and you will answer me.'"
18,42,5,"I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,but now my eye sees you."

18,42,15,"In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers."
18,42,16,"After this Job lived one hundred forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, to four generations."
18,42,17,"So Job died, being old and full of days."

19,106,43,"Many times he delivered them,but they were rebellious in their counsel,and were brought low in their iniquity."
19,106,44,"Nevertheless he regarded their distress,when he heard their cry."
19,106,45,"He remembered for them his covenant,and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses."

20,6,10,"A little sleep, a little slumber,a little folding of the hands to sleep:"

20,6,20,"My son, keep your father's commandment,and do not forsake your mother's teaching."
20,6,21,"Bind them continually on your heart.Tie them around your neck."
20,6,22,"When you walk, it will lead you.When you sleep, it will watch over you.When you awake, it will talk with you."
20,6,23,"For the commandment is a lamp,and the Law is light.Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,"
20,6,24,"to keep you from the immoral woman,from the flattery of the wayward wife's tongue."
20,6,25,"Do not lust after her beauty in your heart,neither let her captivate you with her eyelids."
20,6,26,"For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.The adulteress hunts for your precious life."
20,6,27,"Can a man scoop fire into his lap,and his clothes not be burned?"
20,6,28,"Or can one walk on hot coals,and his feet not be scorched?"
20,6,29,"So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife.Whoever touches her will not be unpunished."
20,6,30,"Men do not despise a thief,if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry:"
20,6,31,"but if he is found, he shall restore seven times.He shall give all the wealth of his house."
20,6,32,"He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding.He who does it destroys his own soul."
20,6,33,"He will get wounds and dishonor.His reproach will not be wiped away."
20,6,34,"For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.He won't spare in the day of vengeance."
20,6,35,"He won't regard any ransom,neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts."
20,7,1,"My son, keep my words.Lay up my commandments within you."
20,7,2,"Keep my commandments and live!Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye."
20,7,3,"Bind them on your fingers.Write them on the tablet of your heart."
20,7,4,"Tell wisdom, You are my sister.Call understanding your relative,"
20,7,5,"that they may keep you from the strange woman,from the foreigner who flatters with her words."
20,7,6,"For at the window of my house,I looked out through my lattice."
20,7,7,"I saw among the simple ones.I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,"
20,7,8,"passing through the street near her corner,he went the way to her house,"
20,7,9,"in the twilight, in the evening of the day,in the middle of the night and in the darkness."
20,7,10,"Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,and with crafty intent."
20,7,11,"She is loud and defiant.Her feet do not stay in her house."
20,7,12,"Now she is in the streets, now in the squares,and lurking at every corner."
20,7,13,"So she caught him, and kissed him.With an impudent face she said to him:"
20,7,14,"Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me.This day I have paid my vows."
20,7,15,"Therefore I came out to meet you,to diligently seek your face,and I have found you."
20,7,16,"I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt."
20,7,17,"I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon."
20,7,18,"Come, let's take our fill of loving until the morning.Let's solace ourselves with loving."
20,7,19,"For my husband isn't at home.He has gone on a long journey."
20,7,20,"He has taken a bag of money with him.He will come home at the full moon."
20,7,21,"With persuasive words, she led him astray.With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him."

21,1,11,"There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after."
21,1,12,"I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem."
21,1,13,"I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with."
21,1,14,"I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind."
21,1,15,"That which is crooked can't be made straight; and that which is lacking can't be counted."
21,1,16,"I said to myself, Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."
21,1,17,"I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind."
21,1,18,"For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow."
21,2,1,"I said in my heart, Come now, I will test you with mirth: therefore enjoy pleasure; and behold, this also was vanity."
21,2,2,"I said of laughter, It is foolishness; and of mirth, What does it accomplish?"
21,2,3,"I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold of folly, until I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their lives."
21,2,4,"I made myself great works. I built myself houses. I planted myself vineyards."
21,2,5,"I made myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit."
21,2,6,"I made myself pools of water, to water from it the forest where trees were reared."
21,2,7,"I bought male servants and female servants, and had servants born in my house. I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all who were before me in Jerusalem;"
21,2,8,"I also gathered silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got myself male and female singers, and the delights of the sons of men-musical instruments, and that of all sorts."
21,2,9,"So I was great, and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also remained with me."
21,2,10,"Whatever my eyes desired, I did not keep from them. I did not withhold my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my portion from all my labor."
21,2,11,"Then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked, and at the labor that I had labored to do; and behold, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no profit under the sun."
21,2,12,"I turned myself to consider wisdom, madness, and folly: for what can the king's successor do? Just that which has been done long ago."
21,2,13,"Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness."
21,2,14,"The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness-and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all."
21,2,15,"Then said I in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart that this also is vanity."
21,2,16,"For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no memory for ever, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. Indeed, the wise man must die just like the fool!"
21,2,17,"So I hated life, because the work that is worked under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind."
21,2,18,"I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who comes after me."
21,2,19,"Who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all of my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity."
21,2,20,"Therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under the sun."
21,2,21,"For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge, and with skillfulness; yet he shall leave it for his portion to a man who has not labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil."
21,2,22,"For what has a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, in which he labors under the sun?"
21,2,23,"For all his days are sorrows, and his travail is grief; yes, even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity."
21,2,24,"There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God."
21,2,25,"For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?"
21,2,26,"For to the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind."
21,3,1,"For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:"
21,3,2,"a time to be born,and a time to die;a time to plant,and a time to pluck up that which is planted;"
21,3,3,"a time to kill,and a time to heal;a time to break down,and a time to build up;"
21,3,4,"a time to weep,and a time to laugh;a time to mourn,and a time to dance;"
21,3,5,"a time to cast away stones,and a time to gather stones together;a time to embrace,and a time to refrain from embracing;"
21,3,6,"a time to seek,and a time to lose;a time to keep,and a time to cast away;"
21,3,7,"a time to tear,and a time to sew;a time to keep silence,and a time to speak;"
21,3,8,"a time to love,and a time to hate;a time for war,and a time for peace."
21,3,9,"What profit has he who works in that in which he labors?"
21,3,10,"I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with."
21,3,11,"He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in their hearts, yet so that man can't find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end."
21,3,12,"I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice, and to do good as long as they live."
21,3,13,"Also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God."
21,3,14,"I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it; and God has done it, that men should fear before him."
21,3,15,"That which is has been long ago, and that which is to be has been long ago: and God seeks again that which is passed away."
21,3,16,"Moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there."
21,3,17,"I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work."
21,3,18,"I said in my heart, As for the sons of men, God tests them, so that they may see that they themselves are like animals."
21,3,19,"For that which happens to the sons of men happens to animals. Even one thing happens to them. As the one dies, so the other dies. Yes, they have all one breath; and man has no advantage over the animals: for all is vanity."
21,3,20,"All go to one place. All are from the dust, and all turn to dust again."
21,3,21,"Who knows the spirit of man, whether it goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, whether it goes downward to the earth?"
21,3,22,"Therefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who can bring him to see what will be after him?"
21,4,1,"Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of those who were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter."
21,4,2,"Therefore I praised the dead who have been long dead more than the living who are yet alive."
21,4,3,"Yes, better than them both is him who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun."
21,4,4,"Then I saw all the labor and achievement that is the envy of a man's neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind."
21,4,5,"The fool folds his hands together and ruins himself."
21,4,6,"Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and chasing after wind."
21,4,7,"Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun."
21,4,8,"There is one who is alone, and he has neither son nor brother. There is no end to all of his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with wealth. For whom then, do I labor, and deprive my soul of enjoyment? This also is vanity, yes, it is a miserable business."
21,4,9,"Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor."
21,4,10,"For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn't have another to lift him up."
21,4,11,"Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one keep warm alone?"
21,4,12,"If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken."
21,4,13,"Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn't know how to receive admonition any more."
21,4,14,"For out of prison he came forth to be king; yes, even in his kingdom he was born poor."
21,4,15,"I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the other, who succeeded him."
21,4,16,"There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was-yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind."
21,5,1,"Guard your steps when you go to God's house; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they do evil."
21,5,2,"Do not be rash with your mouth, and do not let your heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and you on earth. Therefore let your words be few."
21,5,3,"For as a dream comes with a multitude of cares, so a fool's speech with a multitude of words."
21,5,4,"When you vow a vow to God, do not defer to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which you vow."
21,5,5,"It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay."
21,5,6,"Do not allow your mouth to lead you into sin. Do not protest before the messenger that this was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?"
21,5,7,"For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, as well as in many words: but you must fear God."
21,5,8,"If you see the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in a district, do not marvel at the matter: for one official is eyed by a higher one; and there are officials over them."
21,5,9,"Moreover the profit of the earth is for all. The king profits from the field."
21,5,10,"He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he who loves abundance, with increase: this also is vanity."
21,5,11,"When goods increase, those who eat them are increased; and what advantage is there to its owner, except to feast on them with his eyes?"
21,5,12,"The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep."
21,5,13,"There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by its owner to his harm."
21,5,14,"Those riches perish by misfortune, and if he has fathered a son, there is nothing in his hand."
21,5,15,"As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand."
21,5,16,"This also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go. And what profit does he have who labors for the wind?"
21,5,17,"All his days he also eats in darkness, he is frustrated, and has sickness and wrath."
21,5,18,"Behold, that which I have seen to be good and proper is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor, in which he labors under the sun, all the days of his life which God has given him; for this is his portion."
21,5,19,"Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor-this is the gift of God."
21,5,20,"For he shall not often reflect on the days of his life; because God occupies him with the joy of his heart."
21,6,1,"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy on men:"
21,6,2,"a man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God gives him no power to eat of it, but a foreigner eats it. This is vanity, and it is an evil disease."
21,6,3,"If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial; I say, that a stillborn child is better than he:"
21,6,4,"for it comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness."
21,6,5,"Moreover it has not seen the sun nor known it. This has rest rather than the other."
21,6,6,"Yes, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet fails to enjoy good, do not all go to one place?"
21,6,7,"All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled."
21,6,8,"For what advantage has the wise more than the fool? What has the poor man, that knows how to walk before the living?"
21,6,9,"Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind."
21,6,10,"Whatever has been, its name was given long ago; and it is known what man is; neither can he contend with him who is mightier than he."
21,6,11,"For there are many words that create vanity. What does that profit man?"
21,6,12,"For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends like a shadow? For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?"
21,7,1,"A good name is better than fine perfume; and the day of death better than the day of one's birth."
21,7,2,"It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men, and the living should take this to heart."
21,7,3,"Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the face the heart is made good."
21,7,4,"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth."
21,7,5,"It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools."
21,7,6,"For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity."
21,7,7,"Surely extortion makes the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroys the understanding."
21,7,8,"Better is the end of a thing than its beginning.The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit."
21,7,9,"Do not be hasty in your spirit to be angry, for anger rests in the bosom of fools."
21,7,10,"Do not say, Why were the former days better than these? For you do not ask wisely about this."
21,7,11,"Wisdom is as good as an inheritance. Yes, it is more excellent for those who see the sun."
21,7,12,"For wisdom is a defense, even as money is a defense; but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it."
21,7,13,"Consider the work of God, for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?"
21,7,14,"In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yes, God has made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything after him."
21,7,15,"All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who lives long in his evildoing."
21,7,16,"Do not be overly righteous, neither make yourself overly wise. Why should you destroy yourself?"
21,7,17,"Do not be too wicked, neither be foolish. Why should you die before your time?"
21,7,18,"It is good that you should take hold of this. Yes, also from that do not withdraw your hand; for he who fears God will come forth from them all."
21,7,19,"Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city."
21,7,20,"Surely there is not a righteous man on earth, who does good and doesn't sin."
21,7,21,"Also do not take heed to all words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant curse you;"
21,7,22,"for often your own heart knows that you yourself have likewise cursed others."
21,7,23,"All this have I proved in wisdom. I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me."
21,7,24,"That which is, is far off and exceedingly deep. Who can find it out?"
21,7,25,"I turned around, and my heart sought to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know that wickedness is stupidity, and that foolishness is madness."
21,7,26,"I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and traps, whose hands are chains. Whoever pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner will be ensnared by her."
21,7,27,"Behold, this have I found, says the Preacher, one to another, to find out the scheme;"
21,7,28,"which my soul still seeks; but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found."
21,7,29,"Behold, this only have I found: that God made man upright; but they search for many schemes."
21,8,1,"Who is like the wise man? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed."
21,8,2,"I say, Keep the king's command! because of the oath to God."
21,8,3,"Do not be hasty to go out of his presence. Do not persist in an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him,"
21,8,4,"for the king's word is supreme. Who can say to him, What are you doing?"
21,8,5,"Whoever keeps the commandment shall not come to harm, and his wise heart will know the time and procedure."
21,8,6,"For there is a time and procedure for every purpose, although the misery of man is heavy on him."
21,8,7,"For he doesn't know that which will be; for who can tell him how it will be?"
21,8,8,"There is no man who has power over the spirit to contain the spirit; neither does he have power over the day of death. There is no discharge in war; neither shall wickedness deliver those who practice it."
21,8,9,"All this have I seen, and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt."
21,8,10,"So I saw the wicked buried. Indeed they came also from holiness. They went and were forgotten in the city where they did this. This also is vanity."
21,8,11,"Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil."
21,8,12,"Though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times, and lives long, yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him."
21,8,13,"But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he lengthen days like a shadow; because he doesn't fear God."
21,8,14,"There is a vanity which is done on the earth, that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked. Again, there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity."
21,8,15,"Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for that will accompany him in his labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun."
21,8,16,"When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth (for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes),"
21,8,17,"then I saw all the work of God, that man can't find out the work that is done under the sun, because however much a man labors to seek it out, yet he won't find it. Yes even though a wise man thinks he can comprehend it, he won't be able to find it."
21,9,1,"For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hatred, man doesn't know it; all is before them."
21,9,2,"All things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good, to the clean, to the unclean, to him who sacrifices, and to him who doesn't sacrifice. As is the good, so is the sinner; he who takes an oath, as he who fears an oath."
21,9,3,"This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event to all: yes also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead."
21,9,4,"For to him who is joined with all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion."
21,9,5,"For the living know that they will die, but the dead do not know anything, neither do they have any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten."
21,9,6,"Also their love, their hatred, and their envy has perished long ago; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun."
21,9,7,"Go your way-eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works."
21,9,8,"Let your garments be always white, and do not let your head lack oil."
21,9,9,"Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your life of vanity, which he has given you under the sun, all your days of vanity: for that is your portion in life, and in your labor in which you labor under the sun."
21,9,10,"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol, where you are going."
21,9,11,"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happen to them all."
21,9,12,"For man also doesn't know his time. As the fish that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly on them."
21,9,13,"I have also seen wisdom under the sun in this way, and it seemed great to me."
21,9,14,"There was a little city, and few men within it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built great siege works against it."
21,9,15,"Now a poor wise man was found in it, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man."
21,9,16,"Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength. Nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard."
21,9,17,"The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him who rules among fools."
21,9,18,"Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroys much good."
21,10,1,"Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor; so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor."
21,10,2,"A wise man's heart is at his right hand, but a fool's heart at his left."
21,10,3,"Yes also, when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool."
21,10,4,"If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, do not leave your place; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest."
21,10,5,"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler."
21,10,6,"Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place."
21,10,7,"I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth."
21,10,8,"He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake."
21,10,9,"Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered thereby."
21,10,10,"If the axe is blunt, and one doesn't sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings success."
21,10,11,"If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer's tongue."
21,10,12,"The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips."
21,10,13,"The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness."
21,10,14,"A fool also multiplies words.Man doesn't know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him?"
21,10,15,"The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn't know how to go to the city."
21,10,16,"Woe to you, land, when your king is a child,and your princes eat in the morning!"
21,10,17,"Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles,and your princes eat in due season,for strength, and not for drunkenness!"
21,10,18,"By slothfulness the roof sinks in;and through idleness of the hands the house leaks."
21,10,19,"A feast is made for laughter,and wine makes the life glad;and money is the answer for all things."
21,10,20,"Do not curse the king, no, not in your thoughts;and do not curse the rich in your bedchamber:for a bird of the sky may carry your voice,and that which has wings may tell the matter."
21,11,1,"Cast your bread on the waters;for you shall find it after many days."
21,11,2,"Give a portion to seven, yes, even to eight;for you do not know what evil will be on the earth."
21,11,3,"If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth;and if a tree falls toward the south, or toward the north,in the place where the tree falls, there shall it be."
21,11,4,"He who observes the wind won't sow;and he who regards the clouds won't reap."
21,11,5,"As you do not know what is the way of the wind,nor how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child;even so you do not know the work of God who does all."
21,11,6,"In the morning sow your seed,and in the evening do not withhold your hand;for you do not know which will prosper, whether this or that,or whether they both will be equally good."
21,11,7,"Truly the light is sweet,and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to see the sun."
21,11,8,"Yes, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all;but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many.All that comes is vanity."
21,11,9,"Rejoice, young man, in your youth,and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth,and walk in the ways of your heart,and in the sight of your eyes;but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment."
21,11,10,"Therefore remove sorrow from your heart,and put away evil from your flesh;for youth and the dawn of life are vanity."
21,12,1,"Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,before the evil days come, and the years draw near,when you will say, I have no pleasure in them;"
21,12,2,"Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened,and the clouds return after the rain;"
21,12,3,"in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,and the strong men shall bow themselves,and the grinders cease because they are few,and those who look out of the windows are darkened,"
21,12,4,"and the doors shall be shut in the street;when the sound of the grinding is low,and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird,and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;"
21,12,5,"yes, they shall be afraid of heights,and terrors will be in the way;and the almond tree shall blossom,and the grasshopper shall be a burden,and desire shall fail;because man goes to his everlasting home,and the mourners go about the streets:"
21,12,6,"before the silver cord is severed,or the golden bowl is broken,or the pitcher is broken at the spring,or the wheel broken at the cistern,"
21,12,7,"and the dust returns to the earth as it was,and the spirit returns to God who gave it."
21,12,8,"Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher.All is vanity!"
21,12,9,"Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set in order many proverbs."
21,12,10,"The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written blamelessly, words of truth."
21,12,11,"The words of the wise are like goads; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd."
21,12,12,"Furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh."
21,12,13,"This is the end of the matter. All has been heard. Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man."
21,12,14,"For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it is evil."
22,1,1,"The Song of songs, which is Solomon's.Beloved"
22,1,2,"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth;for your love is better than wine."
22,1,3,"Your oils have a pleasing fragrance.Your name is oil poured forth,therefore the virgins love you."
22,1,4,"Take me away with you.Let us hurry.The king has brought me into his chambers.FriendsWe will be glad and rejoice in you.We will praise your love more than wine!BelovedThey are right to love you."
22,1,5,"I am dark, but lovely,you daughters of Jerusalem,like Kedar's tents,like Solomon's curtains."
22,1,6,"Do not stare at me because I am dark,because the sun has scorched me.My mother's sons were angry with me.They made me keeper of the vineyards.I haven't kept my own vineyard."
22,1,7,"Tell me, you whom my soul loves,where you graze your flock,where you rest them at noon;For why should I be as one who is veiledbeside the flocks of your companions?Lover"
22,1,8,"If you do not know, most beautiful among women,follow the tracks of the sheep.Graze your young goats beside the shepherds' tents."
22,1,9,"I have compared you, my love,to a steed in Pharaoh's chariots."
22,1,10,"Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings,your neck with strings of jewels."
22,1,11,"We will make you earrings of gold,with studs of silver.Beloved"
22,1,12,"While the king sat at his table,my perfume spread its fragrance."
22,1,13,"My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh,that lies between my breasts."
22,1,14,"My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossomsfrom the vineyards of En Gedi.Lover"
22,1,15,"Behold, you are beautiful, my love.Behold, you are beautiful.Your eyes are doves.Beloved"
22,1,16,"Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant;and our couch is verdant.Lover"
22,1,17,"The beams of our house are cedars.Our rafters are firs.Beloved"
22,2,1,"I am a rose of Sharon,a lily of the valleys.Lover"
22,2,2,"As a lily among thorns,so is my love among the daughters.Beloved"
22,2,3,"As the apple tree among the trees of the wood,so is my beloved among the sons.I sat down under his shadow with great delight,his fruit was sweet to my taste."
22,2,4,"He brought me to the banquet hall.His banner over me is love."
22,2,5,"Strengthen me with raisins,refresh me with apples;For I am faint with love."
22,2,6,"His left hand is under my head.His right hand embraces me."
22,2,7,"I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,by the roes, or by the hinds of the field,that you not stir up, nor awaken love,until it so desires."
22,2,8,"The voice of my beloved!Behold, he comes,leaping on the mountains,skipping on the hills."
22,2,9,"My beloved is like a roe or a young hart.Behold, he stands behind our wall!He looks in at the windows.He glances through the lattice."
22,2,10,"My beloved spoke, and said to me,Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away."
22,2,11,"For, behold, the winter is past.The rain is over and gone."
22,2,12,"The flowers appear on the earth.The time of the singing has come,and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land."
22,2,13,"The fig tree ripens her green figs.The vines are in blossom.They give forth their fragrance.Arise, my love, my beautiful one,and come away.Lover"
22,2,14,"My dove in the clefts of the rock,In the hiding places of the mountainside,Let me see your face.Let me hear your voice;for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely."
22,2,15,"Catch for us the foxes,the little foxes that spoil the vineyards;for our vineyards are in blossom.Beloved"
22,2,16,"My beloved is mine, and I am his.He browses among the lilies."
22,2,17,"Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away,turn, my beloved,and be like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether."
22,3,1,"By night on my bed,I sought him whom my soul loves.I sought him, but I did not find him."
22,3,2,"I will get up now, and go about the city;in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves.I sought him, but I did not find him."
22,3,3,"The watchmen who go about the city found me;Have you seen him whom my soul loves?"
22,3,4,"I had scarcely passed from them,when I found him whom my soul loves.I held him, and would not let him go,until I had brought him into my mother's house,into the chamber of her who conceived me."
22,3,5,"I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,by the roes, or by the hinds of the field,that you not stir up, nor awaken love,until it so desires."
22,3,6,"Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke,perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,with all spices of the merchant?"
22,3,7,"Behold, it is Solomon's carriage!Sixty mighty men are around it,of the mighty men of Israel."
22,3,8,"They all handle the sword, and are expert in war.Every man has his sword on his thigh,because of fear in the night."
22,3,9,"King Solomon made himself a carriageof the wood of Lebanon."
22,3,10,"He made its pillars of silver,its bottom of gold, its seat of purple,its midst being paved with love,from the daughters of Jerusalem."
22,3,11,"Go forth, you daughters of Zion, and see king Solomon,with the crown with which his mother has crowned him,in the day of his weddings,in the day of the gladness of his heart.Lover"
22,4,1,"Behold, you are beautiful, my love.Behold, you are beautiful.Your eyes are doves behind your veil.Your hair is as a flock of goats,that descend from Mount Gilead."
22,4,2,"Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock,which have come up from the washing,where every one of them has twins.None is bereaved among them."
22,4,3,"Your lips are like scarlet thread.Your mouth is lovely.Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil."
22,4,4,"Your neck is like David's tower built for an armory,whereon a thousand shields hang,all the shields of the mighty men."
22,4,5,"Your two breasts are like two fawnsthat are twins of a roe,which feed among the lilies."
22,4,6,"Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away,I will go to the mountain of myrrh,to the hill of frankincense."
22,4,7,"You are all beautiful, my love.There is no spot in you."

22,6,10,"Who is she who looks forth as the morning,beautiful as the moon,clear as the sun,and awesome as an army with banners?"
22,6,11,"I went down into the nut tree grove,to see the green plants of the valley,to see whether the vine budded,and the pomegranates were in flower."

22,8,8,"We have a little sister.She has no breasts.What shall we do for our sisterin the day when she is to be spoken for?"
22,8,9,"If she is a wall,we will build on her a turret of silver.If she is a door,we will enclose her with boards of cedar.Beloved"

23,8,21,"They will pass through it, sore distressed and hungry; and it will happen that when they are hungry, they will worry, and curse by their king and by their God. They will turn their faces upward,"
23,8,22,"and look to the earth, and see distress, darkness, and the gloom of anguish. They will be driven into thick darkness."
23,9,1,"But there shall be no more gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time, he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations."

23,9,3,"You have multiplied the nation.You have increased their joy.They rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil."
23,9,4,"For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as in the day of Midian."
23,9,5,"For all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle, and the garments rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire."

23,9,17,"Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men,neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows;for everyone is profane and an evildoer,and every mouth speaks folly.For all this his anger is not turned away,but his hand is stretched out still."
23,9,18,"For wickedness burns like a fire.It devours the briers and thorns;yes, it kindles in the thickets of the forest,and they roll upward in a column of smoke."

23,10,10,"As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved images exceeded those of Jerusalem and of Samaria;"
23,10,11,"shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?"
23,10,12,"Therefore it will happen that, when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria, and the insolence of his haughty looks."
23,10,13,"For he has said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have understanding: and I have removed the boundaries of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures. Like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers."
23,10,14,"My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest, and like one gathers eggs that are abandoned, have I gathered all the earth. There was no one who moved their wing, or that opened their mouth, or chirped."
23,10,15,"Should an axe brag against him who chops with it? Should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it? As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood."
23,10,16,"Therefore the Lord, the"
23,10,17,"The light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day."
23,10,18,"He will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. It will be as when a standard bearer faints."
23,10,19,"The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child could write their number."
23,10,20,"It will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them, but shall lean on the"

23,24,18,"It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the midst of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble."
23,24,19,"The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently."
23,24,20,"The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again."

23,25,4,"For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones is like a storm against the wall."
23,25,5,"As the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low."

23,25,12,"He has brought the high fortress of your walls down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust."
23,26,1,"In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah:We have a strong city.He appoints salvation for walls and ramparts."

23,27,7,"Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed?"
23,27,8,"In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind."
23,27,9,"Therefore, by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherim and the incense altars shall rise no more."
23,27,10,"For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches."
23,27,11,"When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor."

23,29,5,"But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away. Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly."
23,29,6,"She will be visited by the"
23,29,7,"The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night."
23,29,8,"It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his hunger isn't satisfied; or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty. The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will be like that."

23,29,13,"The Lord said, Because this people draws near with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but they have removed their heart far from me, but in vain do they worship me, teaching the commandments and doctrines of men."
23,29,14,"Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden."
23,29,15,"Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from the"

23,29,17,"Isn't it yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest?"
23,29,18,"In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness."
23,29,19,"The humble also will increase their joy in the"

23,30,12,"Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, Because you despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on it;"
23,30,13,"therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant."
23,30,14,"He will break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing, so that there won't be found among the broken piece a piece good enough to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern."
23,30,15,"For thus said the Lord"

23,41,3,"He pursues them,and passes by safely,Even by a way that he had not gone with his feet."
23,41,4,"Who has worked and done it,calling the generations from the beginning?I, the"
23,41,5,"The islands have seen, and fear.The ends of the earth tremble.They approach, and come."
23,41,6,"Everyone helps his neighbor.They say to their brothers, Be strong!"
23,41,7,"So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith.He who smoothes with the hammer encourages him who strikes the anvil,saying of the soldering, It is good;and he fastens it with nails, that it might not totter."
23,41,8,"But you, Israel, my servant,Jacob whom I have chosen,the seed of Abraham my friend,"
23,41,9,"You whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth,and called from its corners,and said to you, 'You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you away;'"
23,41,10,"Do not be afraid, for I am with you.Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.I will strengthen you.Yes, I will help you.Yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness."
23,41,11,"Behold, all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded.Those who strive with you will be like nothing, and shall perish."
23,41,12,"You will seek them, and won't find them,even those who contend with you.Those who war against you will be as nothing,as a non-existent thing."
23,41,13,"For I, the"
23,41,14,"Do not be afraid, you worm Jacob,and you men of Israel.I will help you, says the"
23,41,15,"Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument with teeth.You will thresh the mountains,and beat them small,and will make the hills like chaff."
23,41,16,"You will winnow them,and the wind will carry them away,and the whirlwind will scatter them.You will rejoice in the"
23,41,17,"The poor and needy seek water, and there is none.Their tongue fails for thirst.I, the"
23,41,18,"I will open rivers on the bare heights,and springs in the midst of the valleys.I will make the wilderness a pool of water,and the dry land springs of water."
23,41,19,"I will put cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oil trees in the wilderness.I will set fir trees, pine, and box trees together in the desert;"
23,41,20,"that they may see, know, consider, and understand together,that the hand of the"

23,41,22,"Let them announce, and declare to us what shall happen.Declare the former things, what they are,that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them;or show us things to come."
23,41,23,"Declare the things that are to come hereafter,that we may know that you are gods.Yes, do good, or do evil,that we may be dismayed,and see it together."
23,41,24,"Behold, you are of nothing,and your work is of nothing.He who chooses you is an abomination."
23,41,25,"I have raised up one from the north, and he has come;from the rising of the sun, one who calls on my name;and he shall come on rulers as on mortar,and as the potter treads clay."
23,41,26,"Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know?And before, that we may say, 'He is right?'Surely, there is no one who declares.Surely, there is no one who shows.Surely, there is no one who hears your words."
23,41,27,"I am the first to say to Zion, 'Behold, look at them;'and I will give one who brings good news to Jerusalem."
23,41,28,"When I look, there is no man;even among them there is no counselor who, when I ask of them, can answer a word."
23,41,29,"Behold, all of them, their works are vanity and nothing.Their molten images are wind and confusion."
23,42,1,"Behold, my servant, whom I uphold;my chosen, in whom my soul delights-I have put my Spirit on him.He will bring justice to the nations."
23,42,2,"He will not shout,nor raise his voice,nor cause it to be heard in the street."
23,42,3,"He won't break a bruised reed.He won't quench a dimly burning wick.He will faithfully bring justice."
23,42,4,"He will not fail nor be discouraged,until he has set justice in the earth,and for his law the coastlands will hope."
23,42,5,"Thus says God the"

23,42,15,"I will destroy mountains and hills,and dry up all their herbs.I will make the rivers islands,and will dry up the pools."
23,42,16,"I will bring the blind by a way that they do not know.I will lead them in paths that they do not know.I will make darkness light before them,and crooked places straight.I will do these things,and I will not forsake them."
23,42,17,"Those who trust in engraved images,who tell molten images,'You are our gods'will be turned back.They will be utterly disappointed."
23,42,18,"Hear, you deaf,and look, you blind,that you may see."
23,42,19,"Who is blind, but my servant?Or who is as deaf as my messenger whom I send?Who is as blind as he who is at peace,and as blind as the"

23,42,24,"Who gave Jacob as plunder,and Israel to the robbers?Did not the"

23,43,1,"But now thus says the"
23,43,2,"When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;and through the rivers, they will not overflow you.When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned,and flame will not scorch you."
23,43,3,"For I am the"
23,43,4,"Since you have been precious and honored in my sight,and I have loved you;therefore I will give people in your place,and nations instead of your life."
23,43,5,"Do not be afraid; for I am with you.I will bring your seed from the east,and gather you from the west."
23,43,6,"I will tell the north, 'Give them up!'and tell the south, 'Do not hold them back!Bring my sons from far,and my daughters from the ends of the earth-"
23,43,7,"everyone who is called by my name,and whom I have created for my glory,whom I have formed,yes, whom I have made.'"
23,43,8,"Bring out the blind people who have eyes,and the deaf who have ears."
23,43,9,"Let all the nations be gathered together,and let the peoples be assembled.Who among them can declare this,and show us former things?Let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified;or let them hear, and say, That is true."
23,43,10,"You are my witnesses, says the"
23,43,11,"I myself am the"
23,43,12,"I have declared, I have saved, and I have shown;and there was no strange god among you.Therefore you are my witnesses,says the"
23,43,13,"Yes, since the day was I am he;and there is no one who can deliver out of my hand.I will work, and who can hinder it?"
23,43,14,"Thus says the"
23,43,15,"I am the"
23,43,16,"Thus says the"
23,43,17,"who brings forth the chariot and horse,the army and the mighty man(they lie down together, they shall not rise;they are extinct, they are quenched like a wick):"
23,43,18,"Do not remember the former things,and do not consider the things of old."
23,43,19,"Behold, I will do a new thing.It springs forth now.Do you not know it?I will even make a way in the wilderness,and rivers in the desert."
23,43,20,"The animals of the field shall honor me,the jackals and the ostriches;because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert,to give drink to my people, my chosen,"
23,43,21,"the people which I formed for myself,that they might set forth my praise."
23,43,22,"Yet you have not called on me, Jacob;but you have been weary of me, Israel."
23,43,23,"You have not brought me of your sheep for burnt offerings;neither have you honored me with your sacrifices.I have not burdened you with offerings,nor wearied you with frankincense."
23,43,24,"You have bought me no sweet cane with money,nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices;but you have burdened me with your sins.You have wearied me with your iniquities."
23,43,25,"I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake;and I will not remember your sins."
23,43,26,"Put me in remembrance.Let us plead together.Set forth your case,that you may be justified."
23,43,27,"Your first father sinned,and your teachers have transgressed against me."
23,43,28,"Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary;and I will make Jacob a curse,and Israel a reviling."
23,44,1,"Yet listen now, Jacob my servant,and Israel, whom I have chosen."
23,44,2,"This is what the"
23,44,3,"For I will pour water upon the thirsty,and streams on the dry ground.I will pour my Spirit on your seed,and my blessing on your offspring:"
23,44,4,"and they will spring up among the grass,as willows by the watercourses."
23,44,5,"One will say, 'I am the"
23,44,6,"This is what the"
23,44,7,"Who is like me?Who will call,and will declare it,and set it in order for me,since I established the ancient people?Let them declare the things that are coming,and that will happen."
23,44,8,"Do not fear,neither be afraid.Haven't I declared it to you long ago,and shown it?You are my witnesses.Is there a God besides me?Indeed, there is not.I do not know any other Rock."
23,44,9,"Everyone who makes an engraved image is vain.The things that they delight in will not profit.Their own witnesses do not see, nor know, that they may be disappointed."
23,44,10,"Who has fashioned a god,or molds an image that is profitable for nothing?"
23,44,11,"Behold, all his fellows will be disappointed;and the workmen are mere men.Let them all be gathered together.Let them stand up.They will fear.They will be put to shame together."
23,44,12,"The blacksmith takes an axe,works in the coals,fashions it with hammers,and works it with his strong arm.He is hungry,and his strength fails;he drinks no water,and is faint."
23,44,13,"The carpenter stretches out a line.He marks it out with a pencil.He shapes it with planes.He marks it out with compasses,and shapes it like the figure of a man,with the beauty of a man,to reside in a house."
23,44,14,"He cuts down cedars for himself,and takes the cypress and the oak,and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest.He plants a fir tree,and the rain nourishes it."
23,44,15,"Then it will be for a man to burn;and he takes some of it, and warms himself.Yes, he burns it, and bakes bread.Yes, he makes a god, and worships it;he makes it an engraved image, and falls down to it."
23,44,16,"He burns part of it in the fire.With part of it, he eats meat.He roasts a roast, and is satisfied.Yes, he warms himself,and says, Aha! I am warm. I have seen the fire."
23,44,17,"The rest of it he makes into a god,even his engraved image.He bows down to it and worships,and prays to it, and says, Deliver me; for you are my god!"
23,44,18,"They do not know, neither do they consider:for he has shut their eyes, that they can't see;and their hearts, that they can't understand."
23,44,19,"No one thinks,neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say,I have burned part of it in the fire.Yes, I have also baked bread on its coals.I have roasted meat and eaten it.Shall I make the rest of it into an abomination?Shall I bow down to a tree trunk?"
23,44,20,"He feeds on ashes.A deceived heart has turned him aside;and he can't deliver his soul,nor say, Isn't there a lie in my right hand?"
23,44,21,"Remember these things, Jacob and Israel;for you are my servant.I have formed you.You are my servant.Israel, you will not be forgotten by me."
23,44,22,"I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions,and, as a cloud, your sins.Return to me, for I have redeemed you."
23,44,23,"Sing, you heavens, for the"
23,44,24,"Thus says the"
23,44,25,"who foils the omens of the empty talkers,and makes fools of diviners;who turns wise men backward,and makes their knowledge foolish;"
23,44,26,"who confirms the word of his servant,and performs the counsel of his messengers;who says of Jerusalem, 'She will be inhabited;'and of the cities of Judah, 'They will be built,'and 'I will raise up its waste places;'"
23,44,27,"who says to the deep, 'Be dry,'and 'I will dry up your rivers;'"
23,44,28,"Who says of Cyrus, 'He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure,'even saying of Jerusalem, 'She will be built;'and of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'"
23,45,1,"Thus says the"
23,45,2,"I will go before you,and make the rough places smooth.I will break the doors of brass in pieces,and cut apart the bars of iron."
23,45,3,"I will give you the treasures of darkness,and hidden riches of secret places,that you may know that it is I, the"
23,45,4,"For Jacob my servant's sake,and Israel my chosen,I have called you by your name.I have surnamed you,though you have not known me."
23,45,5,"I am the"

23,45,10,"Woe to him who says to a father, 'What have you become the father of?'or to a mother, 'To what have you given birth?'"
23,45,11,"Thus says the"
23,45,12,"I have made the earth, and created man on it.I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens;and I have commanded all their army."
23,45,13,"I have raised him up in righteousness,and I will make straight all his ways.He shall build my city,and he shall let my exiles go free,not for price nor reward, says the"
23,45,14,"Thus says the"
23,45,15,"Most certainly you are a God who hid yourself,God of Israel, the Savior.'"
23,45,16,"They will be disappointed,yes, confounded, all of them.Those who are makers of idols will go into confusion together."
23,45,17,"Israel will be saved by the"
23,45,18,"For thus says the"
23,45,19,"I have not spoken in secret,in a place of the land of darkness.I did not say to the seed of Jacob, 'Seek me in vain.'I, the"
23,45,20,"Assemble yourselves and come.Draw near together, you who have escaped from the nations.Those have no knowledge who carry the wood of their engraved image,and pray to a god that can't save."
23,45,21,"Declare and bring it forth.Yes, let them take counsel together: who has shown this from ancient time? Who has declared it of old? Haven't I, the"
23,45,22,"Look to me, and be you saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else."
23,45,23,"By myself have I sworn, the word is gone forth from my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear."
23,45,24,"Only in the"

23,46,1,"Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols are on the animals, and on the livestock: the things that you carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary."
23,46,2,"They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but they have gone into captivity."
23,46,3,"Listen to me, house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that have been borne from their birth, that have been carried from the womb;"
23,46,4,"and even to old age I am he, and even to gray hairs will I carry you. I have made, and I will bear; yes, I will carry, and will deliver."
23,46,5,"To whom will you liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?"
23,46,6,"Some pour out gold from the bag, and weigh silver in the balance. They hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a god. They fall down-yes, they worship."
23,46,7,"They bear it on the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands, from its place it shall not move: yes, one may cry to it, yet it can not answer, nor save him out of his trouble."
23,46,8,"Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again to mind, you transgressors."
23,46,9,"Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me;"
23,46,10,"declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure;"
23,46,11,"calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yes, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it."
23,46,12,"Listen to me, you stout-hearted, who are far from righteousness:"
23,46,13,"I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not wait; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory."
23,47,1,"Come down, and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans: for you shall no more be called tender and delicate."
23,47,2,"Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove your veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers."
23,47,3,"Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yes, your shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and will spare no man."
23,47,4,"Our Redeemer, the"

23,47,6,"I was angry with my people, I profaned my inheritance, and gave them into your hand: you showed them no mercy; on the aged you have very heavily laid your yoke."
23,47,7,"You said, 'I shall be a mistress forever;' so that you did not lay these things to your heart, nor did you remember the latter end of it."
23,47,8,"Now therefore hear this, you who are given to pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, 'I am, and there is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:'"
23,47,9,"but these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come on you, in the multitude of your sorceries, and the great abundance of your enchantments."
23,47,10,"For you have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, No one sees me; your wisdom and your knowledge, it has perverted you, and you have said in your heart, 'I am, and there is none else besides me.'"
23,47,11,"Therefore disaster will come on you; you won't know when it dawns: and calamity will fall on you; you will not be able to put it away: and desolation shall come on you suddenly and unexpectedly."
23,47,12,"Stand now with your enchantments, and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have labored from your youth; if so be you shall be able to profit, if so be you may prevail."
23,47,13,"You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels: let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save you from the things that shall come on you."
23,47,14,"Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before."
23,47,15,"Thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored: those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter; there shall be none to save you."
23,48,1,"Hear this, house of Jacob, you who are called by the name of Israel, and have come forth out of the waters of Judah; who swear by the name of the"
23,48,2,"(for they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves on the God of Israel; the"
23,48,3,"I have declared the former things from of old; yes, they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them: suddenly I did them, and they happened."
23,48,4,"Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew, and your brow brass;"
23,48,5,"therefore I have declared it to you from of old; before it came to pass I showed it to you; lest you should say, 'My idol has done them, and my engraved image, and my molten image, has commanded them.'"
23,48,6,"You have heard it; see all this; and you, will you not declare it?I have shown you new things from this time, even hidden things, which you have not known."
23,48,7,"They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day you did not hear them; lest you should say, 'Behold, I knew them.'"
23,48,8,"Yes, you did not hear; yes, you did not know; yes, from of old your ear was not opened: for I knew that you dealt very treacherously, and was called a transgressor from the womb."
23,48,9,"For my name's sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for you, that I not cut you off."
23,48,10,"Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction."
23,48,11,"For my own sake, for my own sake, will I do it; for how should my name be profaned? I will not give my glory to another."
23,48,12,"Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he; I am the first, I also am the last."
23,48,13,"Yes, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spread out the heavens: when I call to them, they stand up together."
23,48,14,"Assemble yourselves, all you, and hear; who among them has declared these things? He whom the"
23,48,15,"I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him; I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous."
23,48,16,"Come near to me and hear this:From the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I. Now the Lord"
23,48,17,"Thus says the"
23,48,18,"Oh that you had listened to my commandments! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea:"
23,48,19,"your seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of your body like its grains: his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me."
23,48,20,"Go forth from Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say, the"
23,48,21,"They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he split the rock also, and the waters gushed out."
23,48,22,"There is no peace, says the"
23,49,1,"Listen, islands, to me; and listen, you peoples, from far: the"
23,49,2,"and he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand, he has hidden me: and he has made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he kept me close:"
23,49,3,"and he said to me, You are my servant; Israel, in whom I will be glorified."
23,49,4,"But I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely the justice due to me is with the"
23,49,5,"Now says the"
23,49,6,"yes, he says, It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the nations, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth."
23,49,7,"Thus says the"
23,49,8,"Thus says the"
23,49,9,"saying to those who are bound, 'Come out!'; to those who are in darkness, 'Show yourselves!'They shall feed in the ways, and on all bare heights shall be their pasture."
23,49,10,"They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them: for he who has mercy on them will lead them, even by springs of water he will guide them."
23,49,11,"I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted."
23,49,12,"Behold, these shall come from far; and behold, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim."
23,49,13,"Sing, heavens; and be joyful, earth; and break forth into singing, mountains: for the"

23,49,16,"Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me."
23,49,17,"Your children make haste; your destroyers and those who made you waste shall go forth from you."
23,49,18,"Lift up your eyes all around, and see: all these gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live, says the"
23,49,19,"For, as for your waste and your desolate places, and your land that has been destroyed, surely now you shall be too small for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up shall be far away."
23,49,20,"The children of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears, The place is too small for me; give place to me that I may dwell."
23,49,21,"Then you will say in your heart, 'Who has conceived these for me, since I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering back and forth? Who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?'"
23,49,22,"Thus says the Lord"
23,49,23,"Kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers: they shall bow down to you with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of your feet; and you shall know that I am the"
23,49,24,"Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of a tyrant be delivered?"
23,49,25,"But thus says the"
23,49,26,"I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I, the"
23,50,1,"Thus says the"
23,50,2,"Why, when I came, was there no man? When I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it can't redeem? or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst."
23,50,3,"I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering."
23,50,4,"The Lord"
23,50,5,"The Lord"
23,50,6,"I gave my back to the strikers, and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair; I did not hide my face from shame and spitting."
23,50,7,"For the Lord"
23,50,8,"He is near who justifies me; who will bring charges against me? Let us stand up together: who is my adversary? Let him come near to me."
23,50,9,"Behold, the Lord"
23,50,10,"Who is among you who fears the"
23,50,11,"Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who adorn yourselves with torches around yourselves; walk in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that you have kindled. You shall have this of my hand; you shall lie down in sorrow."
23,51,1,"Listen to me, you who follow after righteousness, you who seek the"
23,51,2,"Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who bore you; for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many."
23,51,3,"For the"
23,51,4,"Attend to me, my people; and give ear to me, my nation: for a law shall go forth from me, and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples."
23,51,5,"My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the peoples; the islands shall wait for me, and on my arm shall they trust."
23,51,6,"Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and those who dwell therein shall die in the same way: but my salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished."
23,51,7,"Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; do not fear the reproach of men, neither be dismayed at their insults."
23,51,8,"For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but my righteousness shall be forever, and my salvation to all generations."
23,51,9,"Awake, awake, put on strength, arm of the"
23,51,10,"Isn't it you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?"
23,51,11,"The ransomed of the"
23,51,12,"I, even I, am he who comforts you: who are you, that you are afraid of man who shall die, and of the son of man who shall be made as grass;"
23,51,13,"and have forgotten the"
23,51,14,"The captive exile shall speedily be freed; and he shall not die and go down into the pit, neither shall his bread fail."
23,51,15,"For I am the"
23,51,16,"I have put my words in your mouth, and have covered you in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and tell Zion, 'You are my people.'"
23,51,17,"Awake, awake, stand up, Jerusalem, that have drunk at the hand of the"
23,51,18,"There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up."
23,51,19,"These two things have happened to you. Who will bemoan you? Desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword; how shall I comfort you?"
23,51,20,"Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of the wrath of the"
23,51,21,"Therefore hear now this, you afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:"
23,51,22,"Thus says your Lord"
23,51,23,"and I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you, who have said to your soul, 'Bow down, that we may walk over you;' and you have laid your back as the ground, and as the street, to those who walk over."
23,52,1,"Awake, awake, put on your strength, Zion; put on your beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean."
23,52,2,"Shake yourself from the dust! Arise, sit up, Jerusalem! Release yourself from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion!"
23,52,3,"For thus says the"
23,52,4,"For thus says the Lord"
23,52,5,"Now therefore, what do I do here, says the"
23,52,6,"Therefore my people shall know my name. Therefore they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks; behold, it is I."
23,52,7,"How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of good, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, Your God reigns!"
23,52,8,"The voice of your watchmen! they lift up the voice, together do they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the"
23,52,9,"Break forth into joy, sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem; for the"
23,52,10,"The"
23,52,11,"Depart, depart, go out from there, touch no unclean thing! Go out of the midst of her! Cleanse yourselves, you who bear the vessels of the"
23,52,12,"For you shall not go out in haste, neither shall you go by flight: for the"
23,52,13,"Behold, my servant shall deal wisely, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high."
23,52,14,"Just as many were astonished at you (his appearance was marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men),"
23,52,15,"so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they understand."
23,53,1,"Who has believed our message?To whom has the arm of the"
23,53,2,"For he grew up before him as a tender plant,and as a root out of dry ground.He has no form nor comeliness.When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him."
23,53,3,"He was despised,and rejected by men;a man of sorrows,and familiar with suffering;as one from whom men hide their face, and we despised himand we did not value him."
23,53,4,"Surely he has borne our sufferings,and carried our sorrows;yet we considered him plagued,struck by God, and afflicted."
23,53,5,"But he was pierced for our transgressions.He was crushed for our iniquities.The punishment that brought our peace was on him;and by his wounds we are healed."
23,53,6,"All we like sheep have gone astray. Everyone has turned to his own way;and the"
23,53,7,"He was oppressed,yet when he was afflicted he did not open his mouth.As a lamb that is led to the slaughter,and as a sheep that before its shearers is mute,so he did not open his mouth."
23,53,8,"He was taken away by oppression and judgment;and as for his generation,who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the livingand stricken for the disobedience of my people?"
23,53,9,"They made his grave with the wicked,and with a rich man in his death;although he had done no violence,neither was any deceit in his mouth."
23,53,10,"Yet it pleased the"
23,53,11,"After the suffering of his soul,he will see light and be satisfied.By his knowledge shall my servant, the righteous one, make many righteous, and he will bear their iniquities."
23,53,12,"Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great,and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;because he poured out his soul to death,and was numbered with the transgressors;yet he bore the sins of many,and made intercession for their transgressions."
23,54,1,"Sing, barren, you who did not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you who did not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than of her that has a husband, says the"
23,54,2,"Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations; do not spare: lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes."
23,54,3,"For you shall spread out on the right hand and on the left; and your seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited."
23,54,4,"Do not be afraid; for you shall not be ashamed: neither be confounded; for you shall not be disappointed: for you shall forget the shame of your youth; and the reproach of your widowhood you shall remember no more."
23,54,5,"For your Maker is your husband; the"
23,54,6,"For the"
23,54,7,"For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies will I gather you."
23,54,8,"In overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment; but with everlasting loving kindness will I have mercy on you, says the"
23,54,9,"For this is like the waters of Noah to me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor rebuke you."
23,54,10,"For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my loving kindness shall not depart from you, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, says the"
23,54,11,"You afflicted, tossed with storms, and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in beautiful colors, and lay your foundations with sapphires."
23,54,12,"I will make your pinnacles of rubies, and your gates of sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious stones."
23,54,13,"All your children shall be taught of the"
23,54,14,"In righteousness you shall be established: you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not be afraid; and from terror, for it shall not come near you."
23,54,15,"Behold, they may gather together, but not by me: whoever shall gather together against you shall fall because of you."
23,54,16,"Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals, and brings forth a weapon for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy."
23,54,17,"No weapon that is formed against you will prevail;and you will condemn every tongue that rises against you in judgment.This is the heritage of the servants of the"
23,55,1,"Come, everyone who thirsts, to the waters! Come, he who has no money, buy, and eat! Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price."
23,55,2,"Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which doesn't satisfy? Listen diligently to me, and eat you that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness."
23,55,3,"Turn your ear, and come to me; hear, and your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David."
23,55,4,"Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples."
23,55,5,"Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know; and a nation that did not know you shall run to you, because of the"
23,55,6,"Seek the"
23,55,7,"let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the"
23,55,8,"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, says the"
23,55,9,"For as the heavens are higher than the earth,so are my ways higher than your ways,and my thoughts than your thoughts."
23,55,10,"For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky,and doesn't return there, but waters the earth,and makes it bring forth and bud,and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater;"
23,55,11,"so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth:it shall not return to me void,but it shall accomplish that which I please,and it shall prosper in the thing I sent it to do."
23,55,12,"For you shall go out with joy,and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing; and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands."
23,55,13,"Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree; and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the"
23,56,1,"Thus says the"
23,56,2,"Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds it fast; who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil."
23,56,3,"Neither let the foreigner, who has joined himself to the"
23,56,4,"For thus says the"
23,56,5,"to them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off."
23,56,6,"Also the foreigners who join themselves to the"
23,56,7,"even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples."
23,56,8,"The Lord"
23,56,9,"All you animals of the field, come to devour, all you animals in the forest."
23,56,10,"His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all mute dogs, they can't bark; dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber."
23,56,11,"Yes, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough; and these are shepherds who can't understand: they have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every quarter."
23,56,12,"Come, say they, I will get wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day, great beyond measure."
23,57,1,"The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil."
23,57,2,"He enters into peace; they rest in their beds, each one who walks in his uprightness."
23,57,3,"But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the prostitute."
23,57,4,"Against whom do you sport yourselves? Against whom do you make a wide mouth, and stick out your tongue? Aren't you children of disobedience, a seed of falsehood,"
23,57,5,"you who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; who kill the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?"
23,57,6,"Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion; they, they are your lot; you have even poured a drink offering to them. You have offered an offering. Shall I be appeased for these things?"
23,57,7,"On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed; there also you went up to offer sacrifice."
23,57,8,"Behind the doors and the posts you have set up your memorial:for you have uncovered to someone besides me,and have gone up;you have enlarged your bed,and made you a covenant with them:you loved their bed where you saw it."
23,57,9,"You went to the king with oil, and increased your perfumes, and sent your ambassadors far off, and debased yourself even to Sheol."
23,57,10,"You were wearied with the length of your way; yet you did not say, 'It is in vain.' You found a reviving of your strength; therefore you weren't faint."
23,57,11,"Of whom have you been afraid and in fear, that you lie, and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart? Haven't I held my peace even of long time, and you do not fear me?"
23,57,12,"I will declare your righteousness; and as for your works, they shall not profit you."
23,57,13,"When you cry, let those who you have gathered deliver you; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain."
23,57,14,"He will say, Cast up, cast up, prepare the way,take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people."
23,57,15,"For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy:I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite."
23,57,16,"For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls who I have made."
23,57,17,"For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry, and struck him; I hid myself and was angry; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart."
23,57,18,"I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners."
23,57,19,"I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near, says the"
23,57,20,"But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it can't rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt."
23,57,21,"There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked."
23,58,1,"Cry aloud, do not spare, lift up your voice like a trumpet, and declare to my people their disobedience, and to the house of Jacob their sins."
23,58,2,"Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and did not forsake the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near to God."
23,58,3,"'Why have we fasted,' say they, 'and you do not see? Why have we afflicted our soul, and you take no knowledge?'Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, and exact all your labors."
23,58,4,"Behold, you fast for strife and contention, and to strike with the fist of wickedness: you do not fast this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high."
23,58,5,"Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the"
23,58,6,"Isn't this the fast that I have chosen: to release the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?"
23,58,7,"Isn't it to distribute your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house? When you see the naked, that you cover him; and that you not hide yourself from your own flesh?"
23,58,8,"Then your light shall break forth as the morning, and your healing shall spring forth speedily; and your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of the"
23,58,9,"Then you shall call, and the"
23,58,10,"and if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then your light shall rise in darkness, and your obscurity be as the noonday;"
23,58,11,"and the"
23,58,12,"Those who shall be of you shall build the old waste places; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in."
23,58,13,"If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, and the holy of the"
23,58,14,"then you shall delight yourself in the"
23,59,1,"Behold, the"
23,59,2,"but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear."
23,59,3,"For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness."
23,59,4,"None sues in righteousness, and none pleads in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity."
23,59,5,"They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he who eats of their eggs dies; and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper."
23,59,6,"Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands."
23,59,7,"Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths."
23,59,8,"The way of peace they do not know; and there is no justice in their goings: they have made them crooked paths; whoever goes therein does not know peace."
23,59,9,"Therefore is justice far from us, neither does righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but, behold, darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity."
23,59,10,"We grope for the wall like the blind; yes, we grope as those who have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among those who are lusty we are as dead men."
23,59,11,"We roar all like bears, and moan bitterly like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us."
23,59,12,"For our transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:"
23,59,13,"transgressing and denying the"
23,59,14,"Justice is turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness can't enter."
23,59,15,"Yes, truth is lacking; and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. The"
23,59,16,"He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation to him; and his righteousness, it upheld him."
23,59,17,"He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle."
23,59,18,"According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense."
23,59,19,"So shall they fear the name of the"
23,59,20,"A Redeemer will come to Zion,and to those who turn from disobedience in Jacob, says the"
23,59,21,"As for me, this is my covenant with them, says the"
23,60,1,"Arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of the"
23,60,2,"For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but the"
23,60,3,"Nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising."
23,60,4,"Lift up your eyes all around, and see: they all gather themselves together, they come to you; your sons shall come from far, and your daughters shall be carried in the arms."
23,60,5,"Then you shall see and be radiant, and your heart shall thrill and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you, the wealth of the nations shall come to you."
23,60,6,"The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim the praises of the"
23,60,7,"All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; they shall come up with acceptance on my altar; and I will glorify the house of my glory."
23,60,8,"Who are these who fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?"
23,60,9,"Surely the islands shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, for the name of the"
23,60,10,"Foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall minister to you: for in my wrath I struck you, but in my favor have I had mercy on you."
23,60,11,"Your gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive."
23,60,12,"For that nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish; yes, those nations shall be utterly wasted."
23,60,13,"The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the fir tree, the pine, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious."
23,60,14,"The sons of those who afflicted you shall come bending to you; and all those who despised you shall bow themselves down at the soles of your feet; and they shall call you The city of the"
23,60,15,"Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through you, I will make you an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations."
23,60,16,"You shall also drink the milk of the nations, and shall nurse from royal breasts; and you shall know that I, the"
23,60,17,"For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron. I will also make your officers peace, and righteousness your ruler."
23,60,18,"Violence shall no more be heard in your land, desolation nor destruction within your borders; but you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise."
23,60,19,"The sun shall be no more your light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you: but the"
23,60,20,"Your sun shall no more go down, neither shall your moon withdraw itself; for the"
23,60,21,"Your people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified."
23,60,22,"The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation; I, the"

23,61,4,"They shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations."
23,61,5,"Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers."
23,61,6,"But you shall be named the priests of the"

23,61,8,"For I, the"

23,63,1,"Who is this who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this who is glorious in his clothing, marching in the greatness of his strength?It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save."
23,63,2,"Why are you red in your clothing, and your garments like him who treads in the wine vat?"
23,63,3,"I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no man with me: yes, I trod them in my anger, and trampled them in my wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments, and I have stained all my clothing."
23,63,4,"For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed has come."
23,63,5,"I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore my own arm brought salvation to me; and my wrath, it upheld me."
23,63,6,"I trod down the peoples in my anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth."
23,63,7,"I will make mention of the loving kindnesses of the"
23,63,8,"For he said, Surely, they are my people, children who will not deal falsely: so he was their Savior."
23,63,9,"In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old."
23,63,10,"But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he himself fought against them."
23,63,11,"Then he remembered the days of old, Moses and his people, saying, Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is he who put his holy Spirit in their midst?"
23,63,12,"who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses? who divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name?"
23,63,13,"who led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness, so that they did not stumble?"
23,63,14,"As the livestock that go down into the valley, the Spirit of the"
23,63,15,"Look down from heaven, and see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory: where are your zeal and your mighty acts? the yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained toward me."
23,63,16,"For you are our Father, though Abraham doesn't know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us: you,"
23,63,17,"O"
23,63,18,"Your holy people possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary."
23,63,19,"We have become as they over whom you never bear rule, as those who were not called by your name."
23,64,1,"Oh that you would tear the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence,"
23,64,2,"as when fire kindles the brushwood, and the fire causes the waters to boil; to make your name known to your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at your presence!"
23,64,3,"When you did awesome things which we did not look for, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence."
23,64,4,"For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen a God besides you, who works for him who waits for him."
23,64,5,"You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember you in your ways. Behold, you were angry, and we sinned. We have been in sin for a long time; and shall we be saved?"
23,64,6,"For we have all become as one who is unclean, and all our righteousness is as a polluted garment: and we all fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away."
23,64,7,"There is none who calls on your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have consumed us by means of our iniquities."
23,64,8,"But now,"
23,64,9,"Do not be furious,"
23,64,10,"Your holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation."
23,64,11,"Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste."
23,64,12,"Will you refrain yourself for these things,"
23,65,1,"I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me. I was near to those who did not seek me. I said, 'Here I am! Here I am!' to a nation that did not call on my name."
23,65,2,"I have spread out my hands all the day to a disobedient and obstinate people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;"
23,65,3,"a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense on bricks;"
23,65,4,"who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; who eat pig's flesh, and the broth of abominable things is in their vessels;"
23,65,5,"who say, Stand by yourself, do not come near to me, for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day."
23,65,6,"Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yes, I will recompense into their bosom,"
23,65,7,"your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says the"
23,65,8,"Thus says the"
23,65,9,"I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there."
23,65,10,"Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me."
23,65,11,"But you who forsake the"
23,65,12,"I will destine you to the sword, and you shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not listen; but you did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight."
23,65,13,"Therefore thus says the Lord"
23,65,14,"behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for anguish of spirit."
23,65,15,"You shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen; and the Lord"
23,65,16,"so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from my eyes."
23,65,17,"For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind."
23,65,18,"But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy."
23,65,19,"I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying."
23,65,20,"There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; for the child shall die one hundred years old, and the sinner being one hundred years old shall be accursed."
23,65,21,"They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat their fruit."
23,65,22,"They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands."
23,65,23,"They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of the"
23,65,24,"It shall happen that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear."
23,65,25,"The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, says the"
23,66,1,"Thus says the"
23,66,2,"For all these things has my hand made, and so all these things came to be, says the"
23,66,3,"He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog's neck; he who offers an offering, as he who offers pig's blood; he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations:"
23,66,4,"I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them; because when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they did not listen; but they did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight."
23,66,5,"Hear the word of the"
23,66,6,"A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the"
23,66,7,"Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she delivered a son."
23,66,8,"Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children."
23,66,9,"Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says the"
23,66,10,"Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her;"
23,66,11,"that you may nurse and be satisfied at the comforting breasts; that you may drink deeply, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory."
23,66,12,"For thus says the"
23,66,13,"As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted in Jerusalem."
23,66,14,"You will see it, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass: and the hand of the"
23,66,15,"For, behold, the"
23,66,16,"For by fire will the"
23,66,17,"Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go to the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating pig's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together, says the"
23,66,18,"For I know their works and their thoughts: the time comes, that I will gather all nations and languages; and they shall come, and shall see my glory."
23,66,19,"I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the islands afar off, who have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations."
23,66,20,"They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an offering to the"
23,66,21,"Of them also will I take for priests and for Levites, says the"
23,66,22,"For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says the"
23,66,23,"It shall happen, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, says the"
23,66,24,"They shall go forth, and look on the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they will be loathsome to all mankind."
24,1,1,"The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:"
24,1,2,"to whom the word of the"
24,1,3,"It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month."
24,1,4,"Now the word of the"
24,1,5,"Before I formed you in the belly, I knew you. Before you came forth out of the womb, I sanctified you. I have appointed you a prophet to the nations."
24,1,6,"Then I said, Ah, Lord"
24,1,7,"But the"
24,1,8,"Do not be afraid because of them; for I am with you to deliver you, says the"
24,1,9,"Then the"

24,1,16,"I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands."
24,1,17,"You therefore put your belt on your waist, arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them."
24,1,18,"For, behold, I have made you this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land."
24,1,19,"They will fight against you; but they will not prevail against you; for I am with you, says the"
24,2,1,"The word of the"
24,2,2,"Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, 'Thus says the"

24,2,6,"Neither did they say, 'Where is the"

24,2,8,"The priests did not say, 'Where is the"
24,2,9,"Therefore I will yet contend with you, says the"
24,2,10,"For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there has been such a thing."
24,2,11,"Has a nation changed its gods, which really are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit."
24,2,12,"Be astonished, you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid. Be very desolate, says the"
24,2,13,"For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters, and cut them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water."
24,2,14,"Is Israel a servant? Is he a native-born slave? Why has he become a prey?"
24,2,15,"The young lions have roared at him, and yelled. They have made his land waste. His cities are burned up, without inhabitant."
24,2,16,"The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head."
24,2,17,"Haven't you brought this on yourself, in that you have forsaken the"
24,2,18,"Now what have you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? Or what have you to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?"
24,2,19,"Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backsliding shall reprove you. Know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that you have forsaken the"
24,2,20,"For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bonds; and you said, 'I will not serve;' for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself, playing the prostitute."
24,2,21,"Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed. How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me?"
24,2,22,"For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me, says the Lord"
24,2,23,"How can you say, 'I am not defiled. I have not gone after the Baals'? See your way in the valley. Know what you have done. You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;"
24,2,24,"a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind in her desire. When she is in heat, who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month, they will find her."
24,2,25,"Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst. But you said, 'It is in vain. No, for I have loved strangers, and I will go after them.'"
24,2,26,"As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;"
24,2,27,"who tell wood, 'You are my father;' and a stone, 'You have brought me out:' for they have turned their back to me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, 'Arise, and save us.'"
24,2,28,"But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah."
24,2,29,"Why will you contend with me? You all have transgressed against me, says the"
24,2,30,"I have struck your children in vain. They received no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion."
24,2,31,"Generation, consider the word of the"
24,2,32,"Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number."
24,2,33,"How well you prepare your way to seek love! Therefore you have taught even the wicked women your ways."
24,2,34,"Also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts. You did not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things."
24,2,35,"Yet you said, 'I am innocent. Surely his anger has turned away from me.'Behold, I will judge you, because you say, 'I have not sinned.'"
24,2,36,"Why do you go about so much to change your way? You will be ashamed of Egypt also, as you were ashamed of Assyria."
24,2,37,"From there also you shall go forth, with your hands on your head; for the"
24,3,1,"They say, 'If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him, and become another man's, will he return to her again?' Wouldn't that land be greatly polluted? But you have played the prostitute with many lovers; yet return again to me, says the"
24,3,2,"Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been lain with? You have sat for them by the ways, as an Arabian in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness."
24,3,3,"Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; yet you have a prostitute's forehead, you refused to be ashamed."
24,3,4,"Will you not from this time cry to me, 'My Father, you are the guide of my youth?'"
24,3,5,"'Will he retain his anger forever? Will he keep it to the end?' Behold, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way."
24,3,6,"Moreover, the"
24,3,7,"I said after she had done all these things, 'She will return to me;' but she did not return; and her treacherous sister Judah saw it."
24,3,8,"I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, her sister, did not fear; but she also went and played the prostitute."
24,3,9,"It happened through the lightness of her prostitution, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks."
24,3,10,"Yet for all this her treacherous sister, Judah, has not returned to me with her whole heart, but only in pretense, says the"
24,3,11,"The"
24,3,12,"Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, 'Return, you backsliding Israel,' says the"
24,3,13,"Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against the"
24,3,14,"Return, backsliding children, says the"
24,3,15,"I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding."
24,3,16,"It shall come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says the"
24,3,17,"At that time they shall call Jerusalem 'The throne of the"
24,3,18,"In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers."
24,3,19,"But I said, 'How I would put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies of the nations!' and I said, 'You shall call me My Father, and shall not turn away from following me.'"
24,3,20,"Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so you have dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel, says the"
24,3,21,"A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten the"
24,3,22,"Return, you backsliding children, I will heal your backsliding.Behold, we have come to you; for you are the"
24,3,23,"Truly in vain is help from the hills, the tumult on the mountains. Truly the salvation of Israel is in the"
24,3,24,"But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters."
24,3,25,"Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against the"
24,4,1,"If you will return, Israel, says the"
24,4,2,"and you shall swear, 'As the"
24,4,3,"For thus says the"
24,4,4,"Circumcise yourselves to the"
24,4,5,"Declare in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, 'Blow the trumpet in the land!' Cry aloud and say, 'Assemble yourselves! Let us go into the fortified cities!'"
24,4,6,"Set up a standard toward Zion. Flee for safety! Do not wait; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction."
24,4,7,"A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations; he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place, to make your land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant."
24,4,8,"For this clothe yourself with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of the"
24,4,9,"It shall happen at that day, says the"
24,4,10,"Then I said, Ah, Lord"
24,4,11,"At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;"
24,4,12,"a full wind from these shall come for me. Now I will also utter judgments against them."
24,4,13,"Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as the whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined."
24,4,14,"Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you?"
24,4,15,"For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim:"
24,4,16,"Tell the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, 'Watchers come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Judah."
24,4,17,"As keepers of a field, they are against her all around, because she has been rebellious against me,' says the"
24,4,18,"Your way and your doings have brought these things to you. This is your wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart."
24,4,19,"My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I can't hold my peace; because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war."
24,4,20,"Destruction on destruction is proclaimed; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly are my tents destroyed, and my curtains in a moment."
24,4,21,"How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?"
24,4,22,"For my people are foolish, they do not know me. They are foolish children, and they have no understanding. They are skillful in doing evil, but to do good they have no knowledge."
24,4,23,"I saw the earth, and, behold, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light."
24,4,24,"I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills moved back and forth."
24,4,25,"I saw, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the sky had fled."
24,4,26,"I saw, and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of the"
24,4,27,"For thus says the"
24,4,28,"For this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not relented, neither will I turn back from it."
24,4,29,"Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers; they go into the thickets, and climb up on the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells therein."
24,4,30,"You, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you dress yourselves with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint, in vain do you make yourself beautiful; your lovers despise you, they seek your life."
24,4,31,"For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, saying, Woe is me now! For my soul faints before the murderers."
24,5,1,"Run back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places of it, if you can find a man, if there are any who does justly, who seeks truth; and I will pardon her."
24,5,2,"Though they say, 'As the"
24,5,3,"O"
24,5,4,"Then I said, Surely these are poor. They are foolish; for they do not know the way of the"
24,5,5,"I will go to the great men, and will speak to them; for they know the way of the"
24,5,6,"Therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them, a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them, a leopard shall watch against their cities; everyone who goes out there shall be torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many, and their backsliding is increased."
24,5,7,"How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken me, and sworn by what are no gods. When I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the prostitutes' houses."
24,5,8,"They were as fed horses roaming at large: everyone neighed after his neighbor's wife."
24,5,9,"Shouldn't I punish them for these things? says the"
24,5,10,"Go up on her walls, and destroy; but do not make a full end. Take away her branches; for they are not the"
24,5,11,"For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, says the"
24,5,12,"They have denied the"
24,5,13,"The prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them. Thus shall it be done to them."
24,5,14,"Therefore thus says the"
24,5,15,"Behold, I will bring a nation on you from far, house of Israel, says the"
24,5,16,"Their quiver is an open tomb, they are all mighty men."
24,5,17,"They shall eat up your harvest, and your bread, which your sons and your daughters should eat. They shall eat up your flocks and your herds. They shall eat up your vines and your fig trees. They shall beat down your fortified cities, in which you trust, with the sword."
24,5,18,"But even in those days, says the"
24,5,19,"It will happen, when you say, 'Why has the"
24,5,20,"Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,"
24,5,21,"'Hear now this, foolish people, and without understanding; who have eyes, and do not see; who have ears, and do not hear:"
24,5,22,"Do you not fear me?' says the"
24,5,23,"But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they have revolted and gone."
24,5,24,"Neither do they say in their heart, 'Let us now fear the"
24,5,25,"Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good from you."
24,5,26,"For among my people are found wicked men. They watch, as fowlers lie in wait. They set a trap. They catch men."
24,5,27,"As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit. Therefore they have become great, and grew rich."
24,5,28,"They have grown fat. They shine; yes, they excel in deeds of wickedness. They do not plead the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and they do not judge the right of the needy."
24,5,29,"Shall I not punish for these things? says the"
24,5,30,"An astonishing and horrible thing has happened in the land."
24,5,31,"The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule by their own authority; and my people love to have it so. What will you do in the end of it?"
24,6,1,"Flee for safety, you children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth Haccherem; for evil looks forth from the north, and a great destruction."
24,6,2,"The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off."
24,6,3,"Shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch their tents against her all around; they shall feed everyone in his place."
24,6,4,"Prepare war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! For the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out."
24,6,5,"Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces."
24,6,6,"For the"
24,6,7,"As a well casts forth its waters, so she casts forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds."

24,6,9,"Thus says the"
24,6,10,"To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they can't listen. Behold, the word of the"

24,6,12,"Their houses shall be turned to others,their fields and their wives together;for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, says the"
24,6,13,"For from their least even to their greatest, everyone is given to covetousness;and from the prophet even to the priest, everyone deals falsely."
24,6,14,"They have healed also the hurt of my people superficially,saying, 'Peace, peace!' when there is no peace."
24,6,15,"Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush.Therefore they shall fall among those who fall;at the time that I visit them, they shall be cast down, says the"
24,6,16,"Thus says the"
24,6,17,"I set watchmen over you, saying, 'Listen to the sound of the trumpet!' But they said, We will not listen!"
24,6,18,"Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation, what is among them."
24,6,19,"Hear, earth! 'Behold, I will bring disaster on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it."
24,6,20,"To what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me.'"
24,6,21,"Therefore thus says the"
24,6,22,"Thus says the"
24,6,23,"They take hold of bow and spear. They are cruel, and have no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Zion.'"
24,6,24,"We have heard its report; our hands become feeble: anguish has taken hold of us, and pains as of a woman in labor."
24,6,25,"Do not go forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and terror, are on every side."
24,6,26,"Daughter of my people, clothe yourself with sackcloth, and wallow in ashes! Mourn, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come on us."
24,6,27,"I have made you a tester of metals and a fortress among my people; that you may know and try their way."
24,6,28,"They are all grievous rebels, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly."
24,6,29,"The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away."

24,7,6,"if you do not oppress the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your own hurt:"
24,7,7,"then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even forevermore."
24,7,8,"Behold, you trust in lying words, that can't profit."
24,7,9,"Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods that you have not known,"
24,7,10,"and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered; that you may do all these abominations?"
24,7,11,"Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, says the"
24,7,12,"But go now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel."
24,7,13,"Now, because you have done all these works, says the"
24,7,14,"therefore will I do to the house which is called by my name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh."
24,7,15,"I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, even the whole seed of Ephraim."
24,7,16,"Therefore do not pray for this people, neither lift up a cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I will not hear you."
24,7,17,"Do you not see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?"
24,7,18,"The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger."
24,7,19,"Do they provoke me to anger? says the"
24,7,20,"Therefore thus says the Lord"
24,7,21,"Thus says the"
24,7,22,"For I did not speak to your fathers, nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:"
24,7,23,"but this thing I commanded them, saying, 'Listen to my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people; and walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.'"
24,7,24,"But they did not listen nor turn their ear, but walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward."
24,7,25,"Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:"
24,7,26,"yet they did not listen to me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff: they did worse than their fathers."
24,7,27,"You shall speak all these words to them; but they will not listen to you: you shall also call to them; but they will not answer you."
24,7,28,"You shall tell them, 'This is the nation that has not listened to the voice of the"

24,7,34,"Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land shall become a waste."
24,8,1,"At that time, says the"
24,8,2,"and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the army of the sky, which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought, and which they have worshiped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried, they shall be for dung on the surface of the earth."

24,8,11,"They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace."
24,8,12,"Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No! They were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among those who fall; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, says the"

24,8,21,"For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt: I mourn; dismay has taken hold on me."
24,8,22,"Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then isn't the health of the daughter of my people recovered?"
24,9,1,"Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a spring of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!"
24,9,2,"Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! For they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men."
24,9,3,"They bend their tongue, as their bow, for falsehood; and they are grown strong in the land, but not for truth: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they do not know me, says the"
24,9,4,"Take heed everyone of his neighbor, and do not trust in any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will go about with slanders."
24,9,5,"They will deceive everyone his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to commit iniquity."
24,9,6,"Your habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, says the"

24,9,19,"For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, 'How are we ruined! We are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.'"
24,9,20,"Yet hear the word of the"

24,10,8,"But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock."
24,10,9,"There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skillful men."

24,10,13,"when he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings for the rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries."
24,10,14,"Every man has become brutish and without knowledge; every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them."
24,10,15,"They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish."

24,32,35,"They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through fire to Molech; which I did not command them, neither did it come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.'"
24,32,36,"Now therefore thus says the"
24,32,37,"'Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:"
24,32,38,"and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:"
24,32,39,"and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their good, and of their children after them:"
24,32,40,"and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me."
24,32,41,"Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.'"
24,32,42,"For thus says the"
24,32,43,"Fields shall be bought in this land, about which you say, It is desolate, without man or animal; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans."
24,32,44,"Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the Negev: for I will cause their captivity to return,' says the"
24,33,1,"Moreover the word of the"
24,33,2,"Thus says the"
24,33,3,"'Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great things, and difficult, which you do not know.'"
24,33,4,"For thus says the"
24,33,5,"while men come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hidden my face from this city:"
24,33,6,"'Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth."
24,33,7,"I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first."
24,33,8,"I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, by which they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, by which they have sinned against me, and by which they have transgressed against me."
24,33,9,"This city shall be to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them, and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure to it.'"
24,33,10,"Thus says the"
24,33,11,"the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, Give thanks to the"
24,33,12,"Thus says the"
24,33,13,"In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them,' says the"
24,33,14,"'Behold, the days come,' says the"
24,33,15,"In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land."
24,33,16,"In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is the name by which she shall be called: The"
24,33,17,"For thus says the"
24,33,18,"neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.'"
24,33,19,"The word of the"
24,33,20,"Thus says the"
24,33,21,"then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers."
24,33,22,"As the army of the sky can't be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites who minister to me.'"
24,33,23,"The word of the"
24,33,24,"Do not consider what this people has spoken, saying, 'The two families which the"
24,33,25,"Thus says the"
24,33,26,"then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.'"
24,34,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the"
24,34,2,"Thus says the"
24,34,3,"and you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and your eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.'"
24,34,4,"Yet hear the word of the"
24,34,5,"you shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so shall they make a burning for you; and they shall lament you, saying, Ah Lord! for I have spoken the word,' says the"
24,34,6,"Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,"
24,34,7,"when the king of Babylon's army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities."
24,34,8,"The word that came to Jeremiah from the"
24,34,9,"that every man should let his male servant, and every man his female servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that none should make bondservants of them, of a Jew his brother."
24,34,10,"All the princes and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his male servant, and everyone his female servant, go free, that none should make bondservants of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go:"
24,34,11,"but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids."
24,34,12,"Therefore the word of the"
24,34,13,"Thus says the"
24,34,14,"At the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you: but your fathers did not listen to me, neither inclined their ear."
24,34,15,"You had now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:"
24,34,16,"but you turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and you brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids."
24,34,17,"Therefore thus says the"
24,34,18,"I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts;"
24,34,19,"the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf;"
24,34,20,"I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life; and their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the earth."
24,34,21,"Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, who have gone away from you."
24,34,22,"Behold, I will command, says the"
24,35,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the"
24,35,2,"Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the"
24,35,3,"Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;"
24,35,4,"and I brought them into the house of the"
24,35,5,"I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, Drink wine!"
24,35,6,"But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, 'You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your sons, forever:"
24,35,7,"neither shall you build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days you shall dwell in tents; that you may live many days in the land in which you live.'"
24,35,8,"We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;"
24,35,9,"nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:"
24,35,10,"but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us."
24,35,11,"But it happened, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, 'Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians'; so we dwell at Jerusalem."
24,35,12,"Then came the word of the"
24,35,13,"Thus says the"
24,35,14,"The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day they drink none, for they obey their father's commandment: but I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking; and you have not listened to me."
24,35,15,"I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, 'Return now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers': but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to me."
24,35,16,"Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to me;"
24,35,17,"therefore thus says the"
24,35,18,"Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus says the"
24,35,19,"therefore thus says the"
24,36,1,"It happened in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from the"
24,36,2,"Take a scroll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day."
24,36,3,"It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin."
24,36,4,"Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the"
24,36,5,"Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I can't go into the house of the"
24,36,6,"therefore you go, and read in the scroll, which you have written from my mouth, the words of the"
24,36,7,"It may be they will present their supplication before the"
24,36,8,"Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the"
24,36,9,"Now it happened in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before the"
24,36,10,"Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the"
24,36,11,"When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the"
24,36,12,"he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's room: and behold, all the princes were sitting there, Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes."
24,36,13,"Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people."
24,36,14,"Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them."
24,36,15,"They said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears."
24,36,16,"Now it happened, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words."
24,36,17,"They asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write all these words at his mouth?"
24,36,18,"Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book."
24,36,19,"Then the princes said to Baruch, Go, hide, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you are."
24,36,20,"They went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king."
24,36,21,"So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king."
24,36,22,"Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month: and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him."
24,36,23,"It happened, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier."
24,36,24,"They were not afraid, nor tore their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words."
24,36,25,"Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not hear them."
24,36,26,"The king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but the"
24,36,27,"Then the word of the"
24,36,28,"Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned."
24,36,29,"Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, 'Thus says the"
24,36,30,"Therefore thus says the"
24,36,31,"I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they did not listen.'"
24,36,32,"Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides to them many like words."
24,37,1,"Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah."
24,37,2,"But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, listened to the words of the"
24,37,3,"Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the"
24,37,4,"Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison."
24,37,5,"Pharaoh's army had come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they broke up from Jerusalem."
24,37,6,"Then came the word of the"
24,37,7,"Thus says the"
24,37,8,"The Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire."
24,37,9,"Thus says the"
24,37,10,"For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yes would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.'"
24,37,11,"It happened that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,"
24,37,12,"then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of the people."
24,37,13,"When he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You are falling away to the Chaldeans."
24,37,14,"Then Jeremiah said, It is false; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he did not listen to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes."
24,37,15,"The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison."
24,37,16,"When Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;"
24,37,17,"Then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the"
24,37,18,"Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?"
24,37,19,"Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?"
24,37,20,"Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there."
24,37,21,"Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard; and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard."
24,38,1,"Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying,"
24,38,2,"Thus says the"
24,38,3,"Thus says the"
24,38,4,"Then the princes said to the king, Please let this man be put to death; because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man doesn't seek the welfare of this people, but the hurt."
24,38,5,"Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he who can do anything against you."
24,38,6,"Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king's son, that was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire."
24,38,7,"Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),"
24,38,8,"Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying,"
24,38,9,"My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city."
24,38,10,"Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from here thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies."
24,38,11,"So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah."
24,38,12,"Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords. Jeremiah did so."
24,38,13,"So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard."
24,38,14,"Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of the"
24,38,15,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me."
24,38,16,"So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As the"
24,38,17,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, Thus says the"
24,38,18,"But if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand.'"
24,38,19,"Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews who are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me."
24,38,20,"But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you. Obey, I beg you, the voice of the"
24,38,21,"But if you refuse to go forth, this is the word that the"
24,38,22,"behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, 'Your familiar friends have set you on, and have prevailed over you. Your feet are sunk in the mire, they have turned away back.'"
24,38,23,"They shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans; and you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire."
24,38,24,"Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die."
24,38,25,"But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, 'Declare to us now what you have said to the king; do not hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also what the king said to you':"
24,38,26,"then you shall tell them, 'I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.'"
24,38,27,"Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived."
24,38,28,"So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken."
24,39,1,"It happened when Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and besieged it;"
24,39,2,"in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city),"
24,39,3,"that all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, Nergal Sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon."
24,39,4,"It happened that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah."
24,39,5,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment on him."
24,39,6,"Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon killed all the nobles of Judah."
24,39,7,"Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon."
24,39,8,"The Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem."
24,39,9,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who fell away to him, and the residue of the people who remained."
24,39,10,"But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time."
24,39,11,"Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Jeremiah, saying,"
24,39,12,"Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do to him even as he shall tell you."
24,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon;"
24,39,14,"they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he lived among the people."
24,39,15,"Now the word of the"
24,39,16,"Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, 'Thus says the"
24,39,17,"But I will deliver you in that day, says the"
24,39,18,"For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life will be given to you as a reward; because you have put your trust in me,' says the"
24,40,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the"
24,40,2,"The captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, The"
24,40,3,"and the"
24,40,4,"Now, behold, I release you this day from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, do not: behold, all the land is before you; where it seems good and right to you to go, there go."
24,40,5,"Now while he had not yet gone back, Go back then, he said, to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go."
24,40,6,"Then went Jeremiah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land."
24,40,7,"Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon;"
24,40,8,"then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men."
24,40,9,"Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you."
24,40,10,"As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come to us: but you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken."
24,40,11,"Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;"
24,40,12,"then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much."
24,40,13,"Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,"
24,40,14,"and said to him, Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them."
24,40,15,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?"
24,40,16,"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing; for you speak falsely of Ishmael."
24,41,1,"Now it happened in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah."
24,41,2,"Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land."
24,41,3,"Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war."
24,41,4,"It happened the second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and no man knew it,"
24,41,5,"that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the"
24,41,6,"Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it happened, as he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam."
24,41,7,"It was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men who were with him."
24,41,8,"But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, Do not kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he stopped, and did not kill them among their brothers."
24,41,9,"Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was who which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed."
24,41,10,"Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people who were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon."
24,41,11,"But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,"
24,41,12,"then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon."
24,41,13,"Now it happened that, when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad."
24,41,14,"So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah."
24,41,15,"But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon."
24,41,16,"Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon:"
24,41,17,"and they departed, and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,"
24,41,18,"because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land."
24,42,1,"Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near,"
24,42,2,"and said to Jeremiah the prophet, Please let our supplication be presented before you, and pray for us to the"
24,42,3,"that the"
24,42,4,"Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray to the"
24,42,5,"Then they said to Jeremiah, The"
24,42,6,"Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the"
24,42,7,"It happened after ten days, that the word of the"
24,42,8,"Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,"
24,42,9,"and said to them, Thus says the"
24,42,10,"'If you will still live in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you."
24,42,11,"Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; do not be afraid of him, says the"
24,42,12,"I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you, and cause you to return to your own land.'"
24,42,13,"But if you say, 'We will not dwell in this land'; so that you do not obey the voice of the"
24,42,14,"saying, 'No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell':"
24,42,15,"now therefore hear the word of the"
24,42,16,"then it shall happen, that the sword, which you fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are afraid, shall follow close behind you there in Egypt; and there you shall die."
24,42,17,"So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there: they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.'"
24,42,18,"For thus says the"
24,42,19,"The"
24,42,20,"For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for you sent me to the"
24,42,21,"and I have this day declared it to you; but you have not obeyed the voice of the"
24,42,22,"Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place where you desire to go to live there."
24,43,1,"It happened that, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of the"
24,43,2,"then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying to Jeremiah, You speak falsely. The"
24,43,3,"but Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon."
24,43,4,"So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, did not obey the voice of the"
24,43,5,"But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven, to live in the land of Judah;"
24,43,6,"the men, and the women, and the children, and the king's daughters, and every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;"
24,43,7,"and they came into the land of Egypt; for they did not obey the voice of the"
24,43,8,"Then came the word of the"
24,43,9,"Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar in the brick work, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;"
24,43,10,"and tell them, 'Thus says the"
24,43,11,"He shall come, and shall strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death shall be put to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword."
24,43,12,"I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he shall go forth from there in peace."
24,43,13,"He shall also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.'"
24,44,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt, who lived at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying,"
24,44,2,"Thus says the"
24,44,3,"because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, to serve other gods, that they did not know, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers."
24,44,4,"However I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, 'Oh, do not do this abominable thing that I hate.'"
24,44,5,"But they did not listen, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods."
24,44,6,"Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day.'"
24,44,7,"Therefore now thus says the"
24,44,8,"in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have gone to live; that you may be cut off, and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?"
24,44,9,"Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?"
24,44,10,"They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.'"
24,44,11,"Therefore thus says the"
24,44,12,"I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to live there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be an object of horror, an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach."
24,44,13,"For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;"
24,44,14,"so that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, shall escape or be left, to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return save such as shall escape.'"
24,44,15,"Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,"
24,44,16,"As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the"
24,44,17,"But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil."
24,44,18,"But since we left off burning incense to the queen of the sky, and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine."
24,44,19,"When we burned incense to the queen of the sky, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?"
24,44,20,"Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people who had given him an answer, saying,"
24,44,21,"The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land. Did not the"
24,44,22,"so that the"
24,44,23,"Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against the"
24,44,24,"Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the"
24,44,25,"Thus says the"
24,44,26,"Therefore hear the word of the"
24,44,27,"Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until they are all gone."
24,44,28,"Those who escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs."
24,44,29,"This shall be the sign to you,' says the"
24,44,30,"Thus says the"
24,45,1,"The message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,"
24,45,2,"Thus says the"
24,45,3,"'You said, Woe is me now! For the"
24,45,4,"You shall tell him, 'Thus says the"
24,45,5,"Do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for, behold, I will bring disaster on all flesh, says the"
24,46,1,"The word of the"
24,46,2,"Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah."
24,46,3,"Prepare the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle!"
24,46,4,"Harness the horses, and get up, you horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail."
24,46,5,"Why have I seen it? They are dismayed and are turned backward; and their mighty ones are beaten down, and have fled in haste, and do not look back: terror is on every side, says the"
24,46,6,"Do not let the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled and fallen."
24,46,7,"Who is this who rises up like the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?"
24,46,8,"Egypt rises up like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves like the rivers: and he says, 'I will rise up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy cities and its inhabitants.'"
24,46,9,"Go up, you horses; and rage, you chariots; and let the mighty men go forth: Cush and Put, who handle the shield; and the Ludim, who handle and bend the bow."
24,46,10,"For that day is of the Lord, the"
24,46,11,"Go up into Gilead, and take balm, virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain do you use many medicines; there is no healing for you."
24,46,12,"The nations have heard of your shame, and the earth is full of your cry; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, they are fallen both of them together."
24,46,13,"The word that the"
24,46,14,"Declare in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes: say, 'Stand forth, and prepare; for the sword has devoured around you.'"
24,46,15,"Why are your strong ones swept away? They did not stand, because the"
24,46,16,"He made many to stumble, yes, they fell one on another: and they said, 'Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our birth, from the oppressing sword.'"
24,46,17,"They cried there, 'Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he has let the appointed time pass by.'"
24,46,18,"As I live, says the King, whose name is the"
24,46,19,"You daughter who dwells in Egypt, furnish yourself to go into captivity; for Memphis shall become a desolation, and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant."
24,46,20,"Egypt is a very beautiful heifer; but destruction out of the north has come, it has come."
24,46,21,"Also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall; for they also are turned back, they are fled away together, they did not stand: for the day of their calamity has come on them, the time of their visitation."
24,46,22,"The sound of it shall go like the serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as wood cutters."
24,46,23,"They shall cut down her forest, says the"
24,46,24,"The daughter of Egypt shall be disappointed; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north."
24,46,25,"The"
24,46,26,"and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants; and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old,' says the"
24,46,27,"'But do not be afraid, Jacob my servant, neither be dismayed, Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid."
24,46,28,"Do not be afraid, O Jacob my servant,' says the"
24,47,1,"The word of the"
24,47,2,"Thus says the"
24,47,3,"At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers do not look back to their children for feebleness of hands;"
24,47,4,"because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains: for the"
24,47,5,"Baldness has come on Gaza; Ashkelon is brought to nothing, the remnant of their valley: how long will you cut yourself?"
24,47,6,"You sword of the"

24,48,1,"Of Moab. Thus says the"
24,48,2,"The praise of Moab is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her: Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation. You also, Madmen, shall be brought to silence: the sword shall pursue you."
24,48,3,"The sound of a cry from Horonaim, desolation and great destruction!"
24,48,4,"Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard."
24,48,5,"For by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up; for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction."
24,48,6,"Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness."
24,48,7,"For, because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures, you also shall be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity, his priests and his princes together."
24,48,8,"The destroyer shall come on every city, and no city shall escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed; as the"
24,48,9,"Give wings to Moab, that she may fly and get her away: and her cities shall become a desolation, without any to dwell therein.'"
24,48,10,"Cursed is he who does the work of the"
24,48,11,"'Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remains in him, and his scent is not changed."
24,48,12,"Therefore behold, the days come,' says the"
24,48,13,"Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence."
24,48,14,"How can you say, We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war?"
24,48,15,"Moab is laid waste, and they are gone up into his cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter,' says the King, whose name is the"
24,48,16,"The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hurries fast."
24,48,17,"All you who are around him, bemoan him, and all you who know his name; say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod!"
24,48,18,"You daughter who dwells in Dibon, come down from your glory, and sit in thirst; for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you, he has destroyed your strongholds."
24,48,19,"Inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and watch: ask him who flees, and her who escapes; say, What has been done?"
24,48,20,"Moab is disappointed; for it is broken down: wail and cry; tell it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste."
24,48,21,"Judgment has come on the plain country, on Holon, and on Jahzah, and on Mephaath,"
24,48,22,"and on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Beth Diblathaim,"
24,48,23,"and on Kiriathaim, and on Beth Gamul, and on Beth Meon,"
24,48,24,"and on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near."
24,48,25,"The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken,' says the"
24,48,26,"'Make him drunken; for he magnified himself against the"
24,48,27,"For wasn't Israel a derision to you? Was he found among thieves? For as often as you speak of him, you shake your head."
24,48,28,"You inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock; and be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss."
24,48,29,"We have heard of the pride of Moab. He is very proud; his loftiness, and his pride, and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart."
24,48,30,"I know his wrath,' says the"
24,48,31,"Therefore will I wail for Moab; yes, I will cry out for all Moab: for the men of Kir Heres shall they mourn."
24,48,32,"With more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for you, vine of Sibmah: your branches passed over the sea, they reached even to the sea of Jazer: on your summer fruits and on your vintage the destroyer is fallen."
24,48,33,"Gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to cease from the wine presses: none shall tread with shouting; the shouting shall be no shouting."
24,48,34,"From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, even to Jahaz have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim, to Eglath Shelishiyah: for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate."
24,48,35,"Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab,' says the"
24,48,36,"Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like pipes, and my heart sounds like pipes for the men of Kir Heres: therefore the abundance that he has gotten is perished."
24,48,37,"For every head is bald, and every beard clipped: on all the hands are cuttings, and on the waist sackcloth."
24,48,38,"On all the housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation every where; for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which none delights,' says the"
24,48,39,"How it is broken down! How they wail! How Moab has turned the back with shame! So shall Moab become a derision and a terror to all who are around him.'"
24,48,40,"For thus says the"
24,48,41,"Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs."
24,48,42,"Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he has magnified himself against the"
24,48,43,"Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are on you, inhabitant of Moab, says the"
24,48,44,"He who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring on him, even on Moab, the year of their visitation,' says the"
24,48,45,"'Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon; for a fire is gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and has devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones."
24,48,46,"Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh is undone; for your sons are taken away captive, and your daughters into captivity."
24,48,47,"Yet will I bring back the captivity of Moab in the latter days,' says the"
24,49,1,"Of the children of Ammon. Thus says the"
24,49,2,"Therefore behold, the days come,' says the"
24,49,3,"'Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, you daughters of Rabbah, clothe yourself in sackcloth: lament, and run back and forth among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together."
24,49,4,"Why do you glory in the valleys, your flowing valley, backsliding daughter? You who trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come to me?"
24,49,5,"Behold, I will bring a fear on you,' says the Lord, the"
24,49,6,"But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon,' says the"
24,49,7,"Of Edom. Thus says the"
24,49,8,"Flee, turn back, dwell in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him, the time that I shall visit him."
24,49,9,"If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? If thieves by night, wouldn't they destroy until they had enough?"
24,49,10,"But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brothers, and his neighbors; and he is no more."
24,49,11,"Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust in me.'"
24,49,12,"For thus says the"
24,49,13,"For I have sworn by myself,' says the"

24,52,5,"So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah."
24,52,6,"In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land."
24,52,7,"Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were against the city all around;) and they went toward the Arabah."
24,52,8,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him."
24,52,9,"Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment on him."
24,52,10,"The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he killed also all the princes of Judah in Riblah."
24,52,11,"He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death."
24,52,12,"Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem:"

24,52,26,"Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah."
24,52,27,"The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land."

26,8,3,"He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the sky, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looks toward the north; where there was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy."
26,8,4,"Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain."
26,8,5,"Then he said to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and see, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry."
26,8,6,"He said to me, Son of man, do you see what they do? Even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But you shall again see yet other great abominations."
26,8,7,"He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall."
26,8,8,"Then he said to me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had dug in the wall, behold, a door."
26,8,9,"He said to me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here."
26,8,10,"So I went in and saw; and see, every form of creeping things, and abominable animals, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed around on the wall."
26,8,11,"There stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel; and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up."
26,8,12,"Then he said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his rooms of imagery? For they say, 'The"
26,8,13,"He said also to me, You shall again see yet other great abominations which they do."
26,8,14,"Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the"

26,8,16,"He brought me into the inner court of the"
26,8,17,"Then he said to me, Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger: and behold, they put the branch to their nose."
26,8,18,"Therefore will I also deal in wrath; my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them."
26,9,1,"Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand."
26,9,2,"Behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man in their midst clothed in linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side. They went in, and stood beside the bronze altar."
26,9,3,"The glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer's inkhorn by his side."
26,9,4,"The"

26,9,6,"kill utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but do not come near any man on whom is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men that were before the house."
26,9,7,"He said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go forth! They went forth, and struck in the city."
26,9,8,"It happened, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell on my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord"
26,9,9,"Then he said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perversion: for they say, 'The"

26,9,11,"Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as you have commanded me."
26,10,1,"Then I looked, and saw, in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne."
26,10,2,"He spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. He went in as I watched."
26,10,3,"Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court."
26,10,4,"The glory of the"
26,10,5,"The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks."
26,10,6,"It came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel."
26,10,7,"The cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took of it, and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out."
26,10,8,"There appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings."
26,10,9,"I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone."
26,10,10,"As for their appearance, the four of them had one likeness, like a wheel within a wheel."
26,10,11,"When they went, they went in their four directions: they didn't turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it; they didn't turn as they went."
26,10,12,"Their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes all around, even the wheels that the four of them had."
26,10,13,"As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, the whirling wheels."
26,10,14,"Every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle."
26,10,15,"The cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar."
26,10,16,"When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also didn't turn from beside them."
26,10,17,"When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them."
26,10,18,"The glory of the"
26,10,19,"The cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of the"

26,10,21,"Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings."
26,10,22,"As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward."
26,11,1,"Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of the"
26,11,2,"He said to me, Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city;"
26,11,3,"who say, 'The time is not near to build houses: this is the caldron, and we are the meat.'"

26,16,3,"and say, 'Thus says the Lord"
26,16,4,"As for your birth, in the day you were born your navel was not cut, neither were you washed in water to cleanse you; you weren't salted at all, nor swaddled at all."
26,16,5,"No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you, to have compassion on you; but you were cast out in the open field, for that your person was abhorred, in the day that you were born."
26,16,6,"'When I passed by you, and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you, Though you are in your blood, live; yes, I said to you, Though you are in your blood, live."
26,16,7,"I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field, and you increased and grew great, and you attained to excellent ornament; your breasts were fashioned, and your hair was grown; yet you were naked and bare."
26,16,8,"'Now when I passed by you, and looked at you, behold, your time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over you, and covered your nakedness: yes, I swore to you, and entered into a covenant with you,' says the Lord"
26,16,9,"'Then washed I you with water; yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil."
26,16,10,"I clothed you also with embroidered work, and shod you with sealskin, and I dressed you about with fine linen, and covered you with silk."
26,16,11,"I decked you with ornaments, and I put bracelets on your hands, and a chain on your neck."
26,16,12,"I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head."
26,16,13,"Thus you were decked with gold and silver; and your clothing was of fine linen, and silk, and embroidered work; you ate fine flour, and honey, and oil; and you were exceeding beautiful, and you prospered to royal estate."
26,16,14,"Your renown went forth among the nations for your beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put on you,' says the Lord"
26,16,15,"'But you trusted in your beauty, and played the prostitute because of your renown, and poured out your prostitution on everyone who passed by; his it was."
26,16,16,"You took of your garments, and made for yourselves high places decked with various colors, and played the prostitute on them: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so."
26,16,17,"You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and played the prostitute with them;"
26,16,18,"and you took your embroidered garments, and covered them, and set my oil and my incense before them."
26,16,19,"My bread also which I gave you, fine flour, and oil, and honey, with which I fed you, you even set it before them for a pleasant aroma; and thus it was,' says the Lord"
26,16,20,"'Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and you have sacrificed these to them to be devoured. Was your prostitution a small matter,"
26,16,21,"that you have slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through the fire to them?"
26,16,22,"In all your abominations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, and were wallowing in your blood."
26,16,23,"'It has happened after all your wickedness, (Woe, woe to you! says the Lord"
26,16,24,"that you have built for yourselves a vaulted place, and have made yourselves a lofty place in every street."
26,16,25,"You have built your lofty place at the head of every way, and have made your beauty an abomination, and have opened your feet to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your prostitution."
26,16,26,"You have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians, your neighbors, great of flesh; and have multiplied your prostitution, to provoke me to anger."
26,16,27,"See therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished your ordinary food, and delivered you to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way."
26,16,28,"You have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yes, you have played the prostitute with them, and yet you weren't satisfied."
26,16,29,"You have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants, to Chaldea; and yet you weren't satisfied with this."
26,16,30,"'How weak is your heart, says the Lord"
26,16,31,"in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way, and make your lofty place in every street, and have not been as a prostitute, in that you scorn pay."
26,16,32,"'A wife who commits adultery! who takes strangers instead of her husband!"
26,16,33,"They give gifts to all prostitutes; but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them, that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution."
26,16,34,"You are different from other women in your prostitution, in that no one follows you to play the prostitute; and whereas you give hire, and no hire is given to you, therefore you are different.'"
26,16,35,"Therefore, prostitute, hear the word of the"
26,16,36,"Thus says the Lord"
26,16,37,"therefore see, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all those who you have loved, with all those who you have hated; I will even gather them against you on every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness."
26,16,38,"I will judge you, as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy."
26,16,39,"I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your vaulted place, and break down your lofty places; and they shall strip you of your clothes, and take your beautiful jewels; and they shall leave you naked and bare."
26,16,40,"They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords."
26,16,41,"They shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; and I will cause you to cease from playing the prostitute, and you shall also give no hire any more."
26,16,42,"So will I cause my wrath toward you to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from you, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry."
26,16,43,"'Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring your way on your head,' says the Lord"
26,16,44,"'Behold, everyone who uses proverbs shall use this proverb against you, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter."
26,16,45,"You are the daughter of your mother, who loathes her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite."
26,16,46,"Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells at your left hand, she and her daughters; and your younger sister, who dwells at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters."
26,16,47,"Yet have you not walked in their ways, nor done after their abominations; but, as if that were a very little thing, you were more corrupt than they in all your ways."
26,16,48,"As I live,' says the Lord"
26,16,49,"'Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy."
26,16,50,"They were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good."
26,16,51,"Neither has Samaria committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all your abominations which you have done."
26,16,52,"You also, bear you your own shame, in that you have given judgment for your sisters; through your sins that you have committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous that you: yes, be also confounded, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters."
26,16,53,"'I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of your captives in their midst;"
26,16,54,"that you may bear your own shame, and may be ashamed because of all that you have done, in that you are a comfort to them."
26,16,55,"Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; and you and your daughters shall return to your former estate."
26,16,56,"For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,"
26,16,57,"before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are around her, the daughters of the Philistines, who do despite to you all around."
26,16,58,"You have borne your lewdness and your abominations, says the"
26,16,59,"For thus says the Lord"
26,16,60,"Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant."
26,16,61,"Then you shall remember your ways, and be ashamed, when you shall receive your sisters, your elder sisters and your younger; and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant."
26,16,62,"I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall know that I am the"
26,16,63,"that you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your mouth any more, because of your shame, when I have forgiven you all that you have done, says the Lord"
26,17,1,"The word of the"
26,17,2,"Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;"
26,17,3,"and say, 'Thus says the Lord"
26,17,4,"he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs of it, and carried it to a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants."
26,17,5,"He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters; he set it as a willow tree."
26,17,6,"It grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and its roots were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs."
26,17,7,"'There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it."
26,17,8,"It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.'"
26,17,9,"Say, 'Thus says the Lord"
26,17,10,"Yes, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? Shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind touches it? It shall wither in the beds where it grew.'"
26,17,11,"Moreover the word of the"
26,17,12,"Say now to the rebellious house, 'Do you not know what these things mean?' Tell them, 'Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took its king, and its princes, and brought them to him to Babylon:"
26,17,13,"and he took of the royal family, and made a covenant with him; he also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land;"
26,17,14,"that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand."
26,17,15,"But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Shall he prosper? Shall he escape who does such things? Shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?"
26,17,16,"'As I live,' says the Lord"
26,17,17,"Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many persons."
26,17,18,"For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet has done all these things; he shall not escape.'"
26,17,19,"Therefore thus says the Lord"
26,17,20,"I will spread my net on him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me."
26,17,21,"All his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be scattered toward every wind: and you shall know that I, the"
26,17,22,"Thus says the Lord"
26,17,23,"in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing; in the shade of its branches shall they dwell."
26,17,24,"All the trees of the field shall know that I, the"
26,18,1,"The word of the"
26,18,2,"What do you mean, that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?'"
26,18,3,"As I live, says the Lord"
26,18,4,"Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul who sins, he shall die."
26,18,5,"But if a man is just, and does that which is lawful and right,"
26,18,6,"and has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has defiled his neighbor's wife, neither has come near to a woman in her impurity,"
26,18,7,"and has not wronged any, but has restored to the debtor his pledge, has taken nothing by robbery, has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;"
26,18,8,"he who has not given forth on interest, neither has taken any increase, who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has executed true justice between man and man,"
26,18,9,"has walked in my statutes, and has kept my ordinances, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, says the Lord"
26,18,10,"If he fathers a son who is a robber, a shedder of blood, and who does any one of these things,"
26,18,11,"and who does not any of those duties, but even has eaten on the mountains, and defiled his neighbor's wife,"
26,18,12,"has wronged the poor and needy, has taken by robbery, has not restored the pledge, and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, has committed abomination,"
26,18,13,"has given forth on interest, and has taken increase; shall he then live? He shall not live: he has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be on him."
26,18,14,"Now, behold, if he fathers a son, who sees all his father's sins, which he has done, and fears, and does not such like;"
26,18,15,"who has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, has not defiled his neighbor's wife,"
26,18,16,"neither has wronged any, has not taken anything to pledge, neither has taken by robbery, but has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;"
26,18,17,"who has withdrawn his hand from the poor, who has not received interest nor increase, has executed my ordinances, has walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live."
26,18,18,"As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity."
26,18,19,"Yet you say, 'Why doesn't the son bear the iniquity of the father?' When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live."
26,18,20,"The soul who sins, he shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be on him."
26,18,21,"But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die."
26,18,22,"None of his transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he has done he shall live."
26,18,23,"Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? says the Lord"
26,18,24,"But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered: in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them shall he die."
26,18,25,"'Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, house of Israel: Is my way not equal? Aren't your ways unequal?"
26,18,26,"When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies therein; in his iniquity that he has done shall he die."
26,18,27,"Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive."
26,18,28,"Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die."
26,18,29,"Yet the house of Israel says, The way of the Lord is not fair. House of Israel, aren't my ways fair? Aren't your ways unfair?"
26,18,30,"'Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, everyone according to his ways,' says the Lord"
26,18,31,"Cast away from you all your transgressions, in which you have transgressed; and make yourself a new heart and a new spirit: for why will you die, house of Israel?"
26,18,32,"For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies,' says the Lord"
26,19,1,"Moreover, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,"
26,19,2,"and say, 'What was your mother? A lioness: she couched among lions, in the midst of the young lions she nourished her cubs."
26,19,3,"She brought up one of her cubs: he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men."
26,19,4,"The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt."
26,19,5,"'Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her cubs, and made him a young lion."
26,19,6,"He went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men."
26,19,7,"He knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and its fullness, because of the noise of his roaring."
26,19,8,"Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit."
26,19,9,"They put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into strongholds, that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel."
26,19,10,"'Your mother was like a vine, in your blood, planted by the waters: it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters."
26,19,11,"It had strong rods for the scepters of those who bore rule, and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs, and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches."
26,19,12,"But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit: its strong rods were broken off and withered; the fire consumed them."
26,19,13,"Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land."
26,19,14,"Fire is gone out of the rods of its branches, it has devoured its fruit, so that there is in it no strong rod to be a scepter to rule.' This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation."
26,20,1,"It happened in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the"
26,20,2,"The word of the"
26,20,3,"Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and tell them, 'Thus says the Lord"
26,20,4,"Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers;"
26,20,5,"and tell them, 'Thus says the Lord"
26,20,6,"in that day I swore to them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands."
26,20,7,"I said to them, 'Cast away every man the abominations of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the"
26,20,8,"But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me; they each didn't throw away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt."
26,20,9,"But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt."
26,20,10,"'So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness."
26,20,11,"I gave them my statutes, and showed them my ordinances, which if a man does, he shall live in them."
26,20,12,"Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the"
26,20,13,"But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they didn't walk in my statutes, and they rejected my ordinances, which if a man keep, he shall live in them; and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them in the wilderness, to consume them."
26,20,14,"But I worked for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out."
26,20,15,"'Moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;"
26,20,16,"because they rejected my ordinances, and didn't walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols."
26,20,17,"Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I didn't destroy them, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness."
26,20,18,"'I said to their children in the wilderness, 'Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols."
26,20,19,"I am the"

26,20,22,"Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth."
26,20,23,"Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries;"
26,20,24,"because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols."
26,20,25,"Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they should not live;"
26,20,26,"and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the"
26,20,27,"Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them, 'Thus says the Lord"
26,20,28,"For when I had brought them into the land, which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there also they made their pleasant aroma, and they poured out there their drink offerings."
26,20,29,"Then I said to them, 'What does the high place where you go mean?' So its name is called Bamah to this day.'"
26,20,30,"Therefore tell the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord"

26,20,32,"and that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, in that you say, 'We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.'"
26,20,33,"As I live, says the Lord"

26,21,14,"You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike your hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one who is deadly wounded, which enters into their rooms."
26,21,15,"I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: Ah! It is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter."
26,21,16,"'Gather yourselves together, go to the right, set yourselves in array, go to the left, wherever your face is set.'"

26,21,20,"You shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem, the fortified."
26,21,21,"For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the arrows back and forth, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver."
26,21,22,"In his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts."
26,21,23,"It shall be to them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings iniquity to memory, that they may be taken."
26,21,24,"Therefore thus says the Lord"

26,21,29,"while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies to you, to lay you on the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded, whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end."
26,21,30,"Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your birth, will I judge you."
26,21,31,"I will pour out my indignation on you; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men, skillful to destroy."

26,22,5,"Those who are near, and those who are far from you, shall mock you, you infamous one and full of tumult."
26,22,6,"'Behold, the princes of Israel, everyone according to his power, have been in you to shed blood."
26,22,7,"In you have they set light by father and mother; in the midst of you have they dealt by oppression with the foreigner; in you have they wronged the fatherless and the widow."
26,22,8,"You have despised my holy things, and have profaned my Sabbaths."
26,22,9,"Slanderous men have been in you to shed blood; and in you they have eaten on the mountains: in the midst of you they have committed lewdness."
26,22,10,"In you have they uncovered their fathers' nakedness; in you have they humbled her who was unclean in her impurity."
26,22,11,"One has committed abomination with his neighbor's wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in you has humbled his sister, his father's daughter."
26,22,12,"In you have they taken bribes to shed blood; you have taken interest and increase, and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by oppression, and have forgotten me,' says the Lord"
26,22,13,"'Behold, therefore, I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been in the midst of you."

26,22,21,"Yes, I will gather you, and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in its midst."

26,22,25,"There is a conspiracy of her prophets in its midst, like a roaring lion ravening the prey: they have devoured souls; they take treasure and precious things; they have made her widows many in its midst."
26,22,26,"Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hidden their eyes from my Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them."
26,22,27,"Her princes in its midst are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain."
26,22,28,"Her prophets have plastered for them with whitewash, seeing false visions, and divining lies to them, saying, 'Thus says the Lord"

26,22,30,"I sought for a man among them, who should build up the wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none."

26,23,2,"Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:"
26,23,3,"and they played the prostitute in Egypt; they played the prostitute in their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there was handled the bosom of their virginity."
26,23,4,"Their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah."
26,23,5,"Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors,"
26,23,6,"who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses."
26,23,7,"She bestowed her prostitution on them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself."
26,23,8,"Neither has she left her prostitution since the days of Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity; and they poured out their prostitution on her."
26,23,9,"Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, on whom she doted."
26,23,10,"These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters; and her they killed with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they executed judgments on her."
26,23,11,"Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her prostitution which were more than the prostitution of her sister."
26,23,12,"She doted on the Assyrians, governors and rulers, her neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men."
26,23,13,"I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way."
26,23,14,"She increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,"
26,23,15,"dressed with girdles on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them princes to look on, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth."
26,23,16,"As soon as she saw them she doted on them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea."
26,23,17,"The Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them."
26,23,18,"So she uncovered her prostitution, and uncovered her nakedness: then my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul was alienated from her sister."
26,23,19,"Yet she multiplied her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth, in which she had played the prostitute in the land of Egypt."
26,23,20,"She doted on their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses."
26,23,21,"Thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth, in the handling of your bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of your youth."
26,23,22,"Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord"
26,23,23,"the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, princes and men of renown, all of them riding on horses."
26,23,24,"They shall come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples; they shall set themselves against you with buckler and shield and helmet all around; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments."
26,23,25,"I will set my jealousy against you, and they shall deal with you in fury; they shall take away your nose and your ears; and your residue shall fall by the sword: they shall take your sons and your daughters; and your residue shall be devoured by the fire."
26,23,26,"They shall also strip you of your clothes, and take away your beautiful jewels."
26,23,27,"Thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you, and your prostitution brought from the land of Egypt; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more."
26,23,28,"'For thus says the Lord"
26,23,29,"and they shall deal with you in hatred, and shall take away all your labor, and shall leave you naked and bare; and the nakedness of your prostitution shall be uncovered, both your lewdness and your prostitution."
26,23,30,"These things shall be done to you, because you have played the prostitute after the nations, and because you are polluted with their idols."
26,23,31,"You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I give her cup into your hand.'"
26,23,32,"Thus says the Lord"
26,23,33,"You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria."
26,23,34,"You shall even drink it and drain it out, and you shall gnaw the broken pieces of it, and shall tear your breasts; for I have spoken it,' says the Lord"

26,23,38,"Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths."
26,23,39,"For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and behold, thus have they done in the midst of my house."
26,23,40,"'Furthermore you have sent for men who come from far, to whom a messenger was sent, and behold, they came; for whom you did wash yourself, paint your eyes, and decorate yourself with ornaments,"

26,23,42,"The voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on their hands twain, and beautiful crowns on their heads."
26,23,43,"Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, 'Now will they play the prostitute with her, and she with them.'"
26,23,44,"They went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute: so went they in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women."
26,23,45,"Righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women who shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands."
26,23,46,"For thus says the Lord"
26,23,47,"The company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire."
26,23,48,"'Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness."

26,24,6,"Therefore thus says the Lord"
26,24,7,"For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it on the bare rock; she didn't pour it on the ground, to cover it with dust."
26,24,8,"That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood on the bare rock, that it should not be covered.'"
26,24,9,"Therefore thus says the Lord"

26,36,19,"and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them."

26,38,14,"Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and tell Gog, 'Thus says the Lord"

26,38,17,"'Thus says the Lord"
26,38,18,"It shall happen in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel,' says the Lord"

26,39,4,"You shall fall on the mountains of Israel, you, and all your hordes, and the peoples who are with you: I will give you to the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the animals of the field to be devoured."
26,39,5,"You shall fall on the open field; for I have spoken it, says the Lord"

26,39,12,"Seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land."
26,39,13,"Yes, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified, says the Lord"

26,39,15,"Those who pass through the land shall pass through; and when any sees a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, until the undertakers have buried it in the valley of Hamon Gog."

26,39,19,"You shall eat fat until you be full, and drink blood until you are drunk, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you."
26,39,20,"You shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war,' says the Lord"

26,39,24,"According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I to them; and I hid my face from them.'"
26,39,25,"Therefore thus says the Lord"
26,39,26,"They shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell securely in their land, and none shall make them afraid;"

26,40,3,"He brought me there; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate."
26,40,4,"The man said to me, Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I shall show you; for, to the intent that I may show them to you, you are brought here: declare all that you see to the house of Israel."
26,40,5,"Behold, a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed."
26,40,6,"Then came he to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up its steps: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad."
26,40,7,"Every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and the space between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed."
26,40,8,"He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed."
26,40,9,"Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house."
26,40,10,"The lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side."
26,40,11,"He measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;"
26,40,12,"and a border before the lodges, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side."
26,40,13,"He measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a breadth of twenty-five cubits; door against door."
26,40,14,"He made also posts, sixty cubits; and the court reached to the posts, around the gate."
26,40,15,"From the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits."
26,40,16,"There were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate all around, and likewise to the arches; and windows were around inward; and on each post were palm trees."
26,40,17,"Then brought he me into the outer court; and behold, there were rooms and a pavement, made for the court all around: thirty rooms were on the pavement."
26,40,18,"The pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement."
26,40,19,"Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside, one hundred cubits, both on the east and on the north."
26,40,20,"The gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured its length and its breadth."
26,40,21,"The lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side; and its posts and its arches were after the measure of the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits."
26,40,22,"The windows of it, and its arches, and the palm trees of it, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up to it by seven steps; and its arches were before them."
26,40,23,"There was a gate to the inner court over against the other gate, both on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits."
26,40,24,"He led me toward the south; and behold, a gate toward the south: and he measured its posts and its arches according to these measures."
26,40,25,"There were windows in it and in its arches all around, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits."
26,40,26,"There were seven steps to go up to it, and its arches were before them; and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, on its posts."
26,40,27,"There was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits."
26,40,28,"Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;"
26,40,29,"and its lodges, and its posts, and its arches, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in its arches all around; it was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits broad."
26,40,30,"There were arches all around, twenty-five cubits long, and five cubits broad."
26,40,31,"The arches of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees were on its posts: and the ascent to it had eight steps."

26,40,34,"The arches of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees were on its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps."
26,40,35,"He brought me to the north gate: and he measured it according to these measures;"
26,40,36,"its lodges, its posts, and its arches: and there were windows therein all around; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits."
26,40,37,"The posts of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees were on its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps."
26,40,38,"A room with its door was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt offering."
26,40,39,"In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to kill thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering."
26,40,40,"On the one side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables."
26,40,41,"Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they killed the sacrifices."
26,40,42,"There were four tables for the burnt offering, of cut stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice."
26,40,43,"The hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within all around: and on the tables was the flesh of the offering."
26,40,44,"Outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north."
26,40,45,"He said to me, This room, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the duty of the house;"
26,40,46,"and the room whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the duty of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to the"
26,40,47,"He measured the court, one hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house."
26,40,48,"Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side."
26,40,49,"The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps by which they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side."
26,41,1,"He brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tent."
26,41,2,"The breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured its length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits."
26,41,3,"Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits."
26,41,4,"He measured its length, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said to me, This is the most holy place."
26,41,5,"Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side room, four cubits, all around the house on every side."
26,41,6,"The side rooms were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side rooms all around, that they might have hold therein, and not have hold in the wall of the house."
26,41,7,"The side rooms were broader as they encompassed the house higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher around the house: therefore the breadth of the house continued upward; and so one went up from the lowest room to the highest by the middle room."
26,41,8,"I saw also that the house had a raised base all around: the foundations of the side rooms were a full reed of six great cubits."
26,41,9,"The thickness of the wall, which was for the side rooms, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house."
26,41,10,"Between the rooms was a breadth of twenty cubits around the house on every side."
26,41,11,"The doors of the side rooms were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits all around."
26,41,12,"The building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits."
26,41,13,"So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, one hundred cubits long;"
26,41,14,"also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, one hundred cubits."
26,41,15,"He measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;"
26,41,16,"the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries around on their three stories, over against the threshold, with wood ceilings all around, and from the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),"
26,41,17,"to the space above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall all around inside and outside, by measure."
26,41,18,"It was made with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;"
26,41,19,"so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. Thus was it made through all the house all around:"
26,41,20,"from the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made: thus was the wall of the temple."
26,41,21,"As for the temple, the door posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance of it was as the appearance of the temple."
26,41,22,"The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and its corners, and its length, and its walls, were of wood: and he said to me, This is the table that is before the"
26,41,23,"The temple and the sanctuary had two doors."
26,41,24,"The doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves: two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other."
26,41,25,"There were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like as were made on the walls; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside."
26,41,26,"There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side rooms of the house, and the thresholds."
26,42,1,"Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the room that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north."
26,42,2,"Before the length of one hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits."
26,42,3,"Over against the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story."
26,42,4,"Before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits' breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north."
26,42,5,"Now the upper rooms were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middle, in the building."
26,42,6,"For they were in three stories, and they didn't have pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the uppermost was straitened more than the lowest and the middle from the ground."
26,42,7,"The wall that was outside by the side of the rooms, toward the outer court before the rooms, its length was fifty cubits."
26,42,8,"For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and behold, before the temple were one hundred cubits."
26,42,9,"From under these rooms was the entry on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court."
26,42,10,"In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were rooms."
26,42,11,"The way before them was like the appearance of the way of the rooms which were toward the north; according to their length so was their breadth: and all their exits were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors."
26,42,12,"According to the doors of the rooms that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them."
26,42,13,"Then he said to me, The north rooms and the south rooms, which are before the separate place, they are the holy rooms, where the priests who are near to the"
26,42,14,"When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments in which they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertains to the people."
26,42,15,"Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it all around."
26,42,16,"He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed all around."
26,42,17,"He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed all around."
26,42,18,"He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed."
26,42,19,"He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed."
26,42,20,"He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall around it, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common."
26,43,1,"Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east."
26,43,2,"Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory."
26,43,3,"It was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face."
26,43,4,"The glory of the"
26,43,5,"The Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the"
26,43,6,"I heard one speaking to me out of the house; and a man stood by me."
26,43,7,"He said to me, Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever. The house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their prostitution, and by the dead bodies of their kings in their high places;"
26,43,8,"in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their doorpost beside my doorpost, and there was but the wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed: therefore I have consumed them in my anger."
26,43,9,"Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me; and I will dwell in their midst forever."
26,43,10,"You, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern."
26,43,11,"If they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and its fashion, and its exits, and its entrances, and all its forms, and all its ordinances, and all its forms, and all its laws; and write it in their sight; that they may keep the whole form of it, and all its ordinances, and do them."
26,43,12,"This is the law of the house: on the top of the mountain the whole limit around it shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house."
26,43,13,"These are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and its border around its edge a span; and this shall be the base of the altar."
26,43,14,"From the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit."
26,43,15,"The upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns."
26,43,16,"The altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve broad, square in the four sides of it."
26,43,17,"The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad in the four sides of it; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and its bottom shall be a cubit around; and its steps shall look toward the east."
26,43,18,"He said to me, Son of man, thus says the Lord"
26,43,19,"You shall give to the priests the Levites who are of the seed of Zadok, who are near to me, to minister to me, says the Lord"
26,43,20,"You shall take of its blood, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border all around: thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it."
26,43,21,"You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, outside of the sanctuary."
26,43,22,"On the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bull."
26,43,23,"When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish."
26,43,24,"You shall bring them near to the"
26,43,25,"Seven days you shall prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bull, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish."
26,43,26,"Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it."
26,43,27,"When they have accomplished the days, it shall be that on the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, says the Lord"
26,44,1,"Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looks toward the east; and it was shut."
26,44,2,"The"
26,44,3,"As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before the"
26,44,4,"Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and behold, the glory of the"
26,44,5,"The"
26,44,6,"You shall tell the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, 'Thus says the Lord"
26,44,7,"in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, to add to all your abominations."
26,44,8,"You have not performed the duty of my holy things; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves.'"
26,44,9,"Thus says the Lord"
26,44,10,"But the Levites who went far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity."
26,44,11,"Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them."
26,44,12,"Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, says the Lord"
26,44,13,"They shall not come near to me, to execute the office of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed."
26,44,14,"Yet will I make them performers of the duty of the house, for all its service, and for all that shall be done therein."
26,44,15,"'But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who performed the duty of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me; and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood, says the Lord"
26,44,16,"they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my instruction."
26,44,17,"'It shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come on them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within."
26,44,18,"They shall have linen turbans on their heads, and shall have linen breeches on their waists; they shall not clothe themselves with anything that causes sweat."
26,44,19,"When they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they minister, and lay them in the holy rooms; and they shall put on other garments, that they not sanctify the people with their garments."
26,44,20,"'Neither shall they shave their heads, nor allow their locks to grow long; they shall only cut off the hair of their heads."
26,44,21,"Neither shall any of the priests drink wine, when they enter into the inner court."
26,44,22,"Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her who is put away; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest."
26,44,23,"They shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean."
26,44,24,"'In a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to my ordinances shall they judge it: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts; and they shall make my Sabbaths holy."
26,44,25,"'They shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister who has had no husband, they may defile themselves."
26,44,26,"After he is cleansed, they shall reckon to him seven days."
26,44,27,"In the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, says the Lord"
26,44,28,"'They shall have an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and you shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession."
26,44,29,"They shall eat the meal offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs."
26,44,30,"The first of all the first fruits of every thing, and every offering of everything, of all your offerings, shall be for the priest: you shall also give to the priests the first of your dough, to cause a blessing to rest on your house."
26,44,31,"The priests shall not eat of anything that dies of itself, or is torn, whether it be bird or animal."
26,45,1,"'Moreover, when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an offering to the"
26,45,2,"Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred in length by five hundred in breadth, square all around; and fifty cubits for its suburbs all around."
26,45,3,"Of this measure you shall measure a length of twenty-five thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy."
26,45,4,"It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to the"
26,45,5,"Twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall be to the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession to themselves, for twenty rooms."
26,45,6,"'You shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and twenty-five thousand long, side by side with the offering of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel."
26,45,7,"'Whatever is for the prince shall be on the one side and on the other side of the holy offering and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy offering and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward; and in length answerable to one of the portions, from the west border to the east border."
26,45,8,"In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.'"
26,45,9,"Thus says the Lord"
26,45,10,"You shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath."
26,45,11,"The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer: its measure shall be after the homer."
26,45,12,"The shekel shall be twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels plus twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels shall be your mina."
26,45,13,"'This is the offering that you shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat; and you shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of barley;"
26,45,14,"and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is ten baths, even a homer; (for ten baths are a homer;)"
26,45,15,"and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel-for a meal offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them, says the Lord"
26,45,16,"All the people of the land shall give to this offering for the prince in Israel."
26,45,17,"It shall be the prince's part to give the burnt offerings, and the meal offerings, and the drink offerings, in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the Sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meal offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel."
26,45,18,"'Thus says the Lord"
26,45,19,"The priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it on the door posts of the house, and on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the posts of the gate of the inner court."
26,45,20,"So you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who errs, and for him who is simple: so you shall make atonement for the house."
26,45,21,"'In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, you shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten."
26,45,22,"On that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering."
26,45,23,"The seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the"
26,45,24,"He shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah."
26,45,25,"In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, shall he do the like the seven days; according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meal offering, and according to the oil.'"
26,46,1,"Thus says the Lord"
26,46,2,"The prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate outside, and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening."
26,46,3,"The people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before the"
26,46,4,"The burnt offering that the prince shall offer to the"
26,46,5,"and the meal offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah."
26,46,6,"On the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish:"
26,46,7,"and he shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for the bull, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah."
26,46,8,"When the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by its way."
26,46,9,"'But when the people of the land shall come before the"
26,46,10,"The prince, when they go in, shall go in with of them; and when they go out, he shall go out."
26,46,11,"'In the feasts and in the solemnities the meal offering shall be an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah."
26,46,12,"When the prince shall prepare a freewill offering, a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the"
26,46,13,"'You shall prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the"
26,46,14,"You shall prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal offering to the"
26,46,15,"Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering.'"
26,46,16,"Thus says the Lord"
26,46,17,"But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons."
26,46,18,"Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people not be scattered every man from his possession.'"
26,46,19,"Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy rooms for the priests, which looked toward the north: and behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward."
26,46,20,"He said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the meal offering; that they not bring them forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people."
26,46,21,"Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, in every corner of the court there was a court."
26,46,22,"In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed, forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four in the corners were of one measure."
26,46,23,"There was a wall around in them, around the four, and boiling places were made under the walls all around."
26,46,24,"Then he said to me, These are the boiling houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people."
26,47,1,"He brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward; (for the forefront of the house was toward the east;) and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar."
26,47,2,"Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way outside to the outer gate, by the way of the gate that looks toward the east; and behold, there ran out waters on the right side."
26,47,3,"When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles."
26,47,4,"Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the waist."
26,47,5,"Afterward he measured one thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through."
26,47,6,"He said to me, Son of man, have you seen this?Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river."
26,47,7,"Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other."
26,47,8,"Then he said to me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah; and they shall go toward the sea; into the sea shall the waters go which were made to issue forth; and the waters shall be healed."
26,47,9,"It shall happen, that every living creature which swarms, in every place where the rivers come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters have come there, and the waters of the sea shall be healed, and everything shall live wherever the river comes."
26,47,10,"It shall happen, that fishermen shall stand by it: from En Gedi even to En Eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many."
26,47,11,"But the miry places of it, and its marshes, shall not be healed; they shall be given up to salt."
26,47,12,"By the river on its bank, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither, neither shall its fruit fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because its waters issue out of the sanctuary; and its fruit shall be for food, and its leaf for healing."
26,47,13,"Thus says the Lord"
26,47,14,"You shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I swore to give it to your fathers: and this land shall fall to you for inheritance."
26,47,15,"'This shall be the border of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad;"
26,47,16,"Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer Hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran."
26,47,17,"The border from the sea, shall be Hazar Enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side."
26,47,18,"The east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the north border to the east sea you shall measure. This is the east side."
26,47,19,"The south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth Kadesh, to the brook of Egypt, to the great sea. This is the south side southward."
26,47,20,"The west side shall be the great sea, from the south border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side."
26,47,21,"'So you shall divide this land to you according to the tribes of Israel."
26,47,22,"It shall happen, that you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you and to the aliens who live among you, who shall father children among you; and they shall be to you as the native-born among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel."
26,47,23,"It shall happen, that in what tribe the stranger lives, there you shall give him his inheritance,' says the Lord"
26,48,1,"Now these are the names of the tribes: From the north end, beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar Enan at the border of Damascus, northward beside Hamath (and they shall have their sides east and west), Dan, one portion."
26,48,2,"By the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side, Asher, one portion."
26,48,3,"By the border of Asher, from the east side even to the west side, Naphtali, one portion."
26,48,4,"By the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side, Manasseh, one portion."
26,48,5,"By the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side, Ephraim, one portion."
26,48,6,"By the border of Ephraim, from the east side even to the west side, Reuben, one portion."
26,48,7,"By the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side, Judah, one portion."
26,48,8,"By the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer, twenty-five thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the portions, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in its midst."
26,48,9,"The offering that you shall offer to the"
26,48,10,"For these, even for the priests, shall be the holy offering: toward the north twenty-five thousand in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south twenty-five thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the"
26,48,11,"It shall be for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, who have kept my instruction, who didn't go astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray."
26,48,12,"It shall be to them an offering from the offering of the land, a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites."
26,48,13,"Answerable to the border of the priests, the Levites shall have twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be twenty-five thousand, and the breadth ten thousand."
26,48,14,"They shall sell none of it, nor exchange it, nor shall the first fruits of the land be alienated; for it is holy to the"
26,48,15,"The five thousand that are left in the breadth, in front of the twenty-five thousand, shall be for common use, for the city, for dwelling and for suburbs; and the city shall be in its midst."
26,48,16,"These shall be its measures: the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred."
26,48,17,"The city shall have suburbs: toward the north two hundred fifty, and toward the south two hundred fifty, and toward the east two hundred fifty, and toward the west two hundred fifty."
26,48,18,"The remainder in the length, answerable to the holy offering, shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward; and it shall be answerable to the holy offering; and its increase shall be for food to those who labor in the city."
26,48,19,"Those who labor in the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall cultivate it."
26,48,20,"All the offering shall be twenty-five thousand by twenty-five thousand: you shall offer the holy offering foursquare, with the possession of the city."
26,48,21,"The residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy offering and of the possession of the city; in front of the twenty-five thousand of the offering toward the east border, and westward in front of the twenty-five thousand toward the west border, answerable to the portions, it shall be for the prince: and the holy offering and the sanctuary of the house shall be in its midst."
26,48,22,"Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, it shall be for the prince."
26,48,23,"As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west side, Benjamin, one portion."
26,48,24,"By the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, Simeon, one portion."
26,48,25,"By the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar, one portion."
26,48,26,"By the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side, Zebulun, one portion."
26,48,27,"By the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, Gad, one portion."
26,48,28,"By the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar to the waters of Meribath Kadesh, to the brook of Egypt, to the great sea."
26,48,29,"This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their several portions, says the Lord"
26,48,30,"These are the exits of the city: On the north side four thousand and five hundred reeds by measure;"
26,48,31,"and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel, three gates northward: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one."
26,48,32,"At the east side four thousand and five hundred reeds, and three gates: even the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one."
26,48,33,"At the south side four thousand and five hundred reeds by measure, and three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one."
26,48,34,"At the west side four thousand and five hundred reeds, with their three gates: the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher, one; the gate of Naphtali, one."
26,48,35,"It shall be eighteen thousand reeds around: and the name of the city from that day shall be, 'The"
27,1,1,"In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it."
27,1,2,"The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god: and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god."
27,1,3,"The king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in some of the children of Israel, even of the royal family and of the nobles;"
27,1,4,"youths in whom was no blemish, but well-favored, and skillful in all wisdom, and endowed with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the king's palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the language of the Chaldeans."
27,1,5,"The king appointed for them a daily portion of the king's royal food, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at its end they should stand before the king."
27,1,6,"Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah."
27,1,7,"The prince of the eunuchs gave names to them: to Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego."
27,1,8,"But Daniel determined in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's royal food, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself."
27,1,9,"Now God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs."
27,1,10,"The prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths who are of your own age? So would you endanger my head with the king."
27,1,11,"Then said Daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:"
27,1,12,"Test your servants for ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink."
27,1,13,"Then let our faces be looked on before you, and the face of the youths who eat of the king's royal food; and as you see, deal with your servants."
27,1,14,"So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them ten days."
27,1,15,"At the end of ten days their faces appeared better and fatter than all the youths who ate of the king's royal food."
27,1,16,"So the steward took away their royal food, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them vegetables."
27,1,17,"Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams."
27,1,18,"At the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar."
27,1,19,"The king talked with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore they entered the king's service."
27,1,20,"In every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters who were in all his realm."
27,1,21,"Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus."
27,2,1,"In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him."
27,2,2,"Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king."
27,2,3,"The king said to them, I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream."
27,2,4,"Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live forever: tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation."
27,2,5,"The king answered the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a rubbish heap."
27,2,6,"But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream and its interpretation."
27,2,7,"They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation."
27,2,8,"The king answered, I know of a certainty that you would gain time, because you see the thing is gone from me."
27,2,9,"But if you do not make known to me the dream, there is but one law for you; for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, until such time that things might change. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation."
27,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man on the earth who can show the king's matter, because no king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean."
27,2,11,"It is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no other who can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."
27,2,12,"For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon."
27,2,13,"So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be killed; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be killed."
27,2,14,"Then Daniel returned an answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon;"
27,2,15,"he answered Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel."
27,2,16,"Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation."
27,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:"
27,2,18,"that they would seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."
27,2,19,"Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven."
27,2,20,"Daniel answered, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever; for wisdom and might are his."
27,2,21,"He changes the times and the seasons; he removes kings, and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those who have understanding;"
27,2,22,"he reveals the deep and secret things; he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him."
27,2,23,"I thank you, and praise you, God of my fathers, who has given me wisdom and might, and has now made known to me what we desired of you; for you have made known to us the king's matter."
27,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said this to him: Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation."
27,2,25,"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said this to him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, who will make known to the king the interpretation."
27,2,26,"The king answered Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?"
27,2,27,"Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king has demanded is such that no wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, can show to the king;"
27,2,28,"but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has made known to king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these:"
27,2,29,"as for you, O king, your thoughts came into your mind on your bed, what should happen hereafter; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what shall happen."
27,2,30,"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than all the living, but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart."
27,2,31,"You, O king, saw, and behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was extraordinary, stood before you; and its appearance was awesome."
27,2,32,"As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,"
27,2,33,"its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay."
27,2,34,"You saw until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces."
27,2,35,"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."
27,2,36,"This is the dream; and we will tell its interpretation before the king."
27,2,37,"You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;"
27,2,38,"and wherever the children of men dwell, the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand, and has made you to rule over them all: you are the head of gold."
27,2,39,"After you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth."
27,2,40,"The fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things; and as iron that crushes all these, shall it break in pieces and crush."
27,2,41,"Whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, because you saw the iron mixed with miry clay."
27,2,42,"As the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken."
27,2,43,"Whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mix with one another but they shall not hold together, even as iron does not mix with clay."
27,2,44,"In the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall its sovereignty be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all those kingdoms, and it shall stand forever."
27,2,45,"Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what shall happen hereafter: and the dream is certain, and its interpretation sure."
27,2,46,"Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should present an offering and incense to him."
27,2,47,"The king answered to Daniel, and said, Surely your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you have been able to reveal this secret."
27,2,48,"Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon."
27,2,49,"Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king."
27,3,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits, and its breadth six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon."
27,3,2,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up."
27,3,3,"Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
27,3,4,"Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, peoples, nations, and languages,"
27,3,5,"that whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up;"
27,3,6,"and whoever doesn't fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace."
27,3,7,"Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up."
27,3,8,"Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews."
27,3,9,"They answered Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live for ever."
27,3,10,"You, O king, have made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;"
27,3,11,"and whoever doesn't fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace."
27,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, have not regarded you: they do not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up."
27,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king."
27,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar answered them, Is it on purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?"
27,3,15,"Now if you are ready whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music to fall down and worship the image which I have made, well: but if you do not worship, you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?"
27,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter."
27,3,17,"If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king."
27,3,18,"But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up."
27,3,19,"Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated."
27,3,20,"He commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace."
27,3,21,"Then these men were bound in their cloaks, trousers, their turbans, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
27,3,22,"Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego."
27,3,23,"These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
27,3,24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up quickly. He spoke and said to his ministers, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered the king, True, O king."
27,3,25,"He answered, Look, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are unharmed; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods."
27,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace. He spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came forth out of the midst of the fire."
27,3,27,"The satraps, the prefects, and the governors, and the king's ministers, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power on their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their trousers changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them."
27,3,28,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God."
27,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything evil against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be reduced to rubble; because there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way."
27,3,30,"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon."
27,4,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you."
27,4,2,"It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has worked toward me."
27,4,3,"How great are his signs and how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation."
27,4,4,"I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace."
27,4,5,"I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me."
27,4,6,"Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream."
27,4,7,"Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the diviners; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me its interpretation."
27,4,8,"But finally Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him, saying,"
27,4,9,"Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation."
27,4,10,"Thus were the visions of my head on my bed: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and its height was great."
27,4,11,"The tree grew, and was strong, and its height reached to the sky, and its sight to the end of all the earth."
27,4,12,"The leaves of it were beautiful, and its fruit much, and in it was food for all. The animals of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the sky lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it."
27,4,13,"I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the sky."
27,4,14,"He cried aloud, and said this, Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit. Let the animals get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches."
27,4,15,"Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky: and let his portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth."
27,4,16,"Let his mind be changed from man's, and let an animal's mind be given to him; and let seven times pass over him."
27,4,17,"The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whoever he will, and sets up over it the lowest of men."
27,4,18,"This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and you, Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation. But you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you."
27,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken mute for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered, Belteshazzar, Do not let the dream, or the interpretation, trouble you. Belteshazzar answered, My lord, the dream concerns those who hate you, and its interpretation to your adversaries."
27,4,20,"The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to the sky, and its sight to all the earth;"
27,4,21,"whose leaves were beautiful, and its fruit much, and in it was food for all; under which the animals of the field lived, and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their habitation."
27,4,22,"It is you, O king, that are grown and become strong; for your greatness is grown, and reaches to the sky, and your dominion to the end of the earth."
27,4,23,"Whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from the sky, and saying, 'Cut down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of the sky: and let his portion be with the animals of the field, until seven times pass over him."
27,4,24,"This is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come on my lord the king:"
27,4,25,"that you shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field, and you shall be made to eat grass as oxen, and shall be wet with the dew of the sky, and seven times shall pass over you; until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will."
27,4,26,"Whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; your kingdom shall be restored to you. After that you shall have known that the heavens do rule."
27,4,27,"Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of your prosperity."
27,4,28,"All this came on the king Nebuchadnezzar."
27,4,29,"At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon."
27,4,30,"The king spoke and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?"
27,4,31,"While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from the sky, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken. The kingdom has departed from you,"
27,4,32,"and you shall be driven from men; and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field; you shall be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times shall pass over you; until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whoever he wants."
27,4,33,"The same hour was the thing fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the sky, until his hair was grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws."
27,4,34,"At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him who lives forever. For his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation."
27,4,35,"All the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nothing; and he does according to his will in the host of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or tell him, What have you done?"
27,4,36,"At the same time my understanding returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and splendor returned to me; and my counselors and my lords sought me out; and I was established in my kingdom, and even more greatness was added to me."
27,4,37,"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those who walk in pride he is able to humble."
27,5,1,"Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand."
27,5,2,"Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink from them."
27,5,3,"Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them."
27,5,4,"They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone."
27,5,5,"In the same hour came forth the fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote."
27,5,6,"Then the king's face was turned pale, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his thighs gave way, and his knees began knocking together."
27,5,7,"The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the diviners. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever shall read this writing, and show me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom."
27,5,8,"Then came in all the king's wise men; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation."
27,5,9,"Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his face turned pale, and his lords were perplexed."
27,5,10,"Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house. The queen spoke and said, O king, live forever; do not let your thoughts trouble you, nor let your face be changed."
27,5,11,"There is a man in your kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and king Nebuchadnezzar your father, the king, I say, your father, made him chief of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and diviners;"
27,5,12,"because an extraordinary spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and explaining riddles, and solving problems, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation."
27,5,13,"Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, Are you that Daniel, who are of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?"
27,5,14,"I have heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and understanding and extraordinary wisdom are found in you."
27,5,15,"Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known to me its interpretation; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing."
27,5,16,"But I have heard of you, that you can give interpretations, and solve problems. Now if you can read the writing, and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom."
27,5,17,"Then Daniel answered before the king, Keep your gifts for yourself, and give your rewards to another;. Nevertheless I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation."
27,5,18,"You king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty."
27,5,19,"And because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. Whom he would he killed, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down."
27,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was removed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him."
27,5,21,"And he was driven from the sons of men, and his mind was made like the animals', and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the sky; until he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and that he sets up over it whomever he wants."
27,5,22,"You his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this,"
27,5,23,"but have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven. And they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines, have drunk wine from them. And you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see, nor hear, nor know. And the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways, you have not glorified."
27,5,24,"Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed."
27,5,25,"This is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN."
27,5,26,"This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God has numbered your kingdom, and brought it to an end;"
27,5,27,"TEKEL; you are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting."
27,5,28,"PERES; your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians."
27,5,29,"Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom."
27,5,30,"In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain."
27,5,31,"Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old."
27,6,1,"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;"
27,6,2,"and over them three administrators, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account to them, and that the king might not suffer loss."
27,6,3,"Then this Daniel was distinguished above the administrators and the satraps, because an extraordinary spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm."
27,6,4,"Then the administrators and the satraps sought to find a charge against Daniel regarding the kingdom; but they could find no charge or fault, because he was faithful. Neither was there any error or fault found in him."
27,6,5,"Then these men said, We will not find any charge against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God."
27,6,6,"Then these administrators and satraps assembled together to the king, and said this to him, King Darius, live forever."
27,6,7,"All the administrators of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counselors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of you, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions."
27,6,8,"Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed."
27,6,9,"Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree."
27,6,10,"When Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem) and he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did before."
27,6,11,"Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God."
27,6,12,"Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's decree. Haven't you signed a decree, that every man who shall make petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed."
27,6,13,"Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, doesn't regard you, O king, nor the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day."
27,6,14,"Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him. And he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him."
27,6,15,"Then these men assembled together to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed."
27,6,16,"Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said to Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you."
27,6,17,"A stone was brought, and placed on the opening of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel."
27,6,18,"Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him. And his sleep fled from him."
27,6,19,"Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions."
27,6,20,"When he came near to the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, Daniel, servant of the living God. Is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?"
27,6,21,"Then said Daniel to the king, O king, live forever."
27,6,22,"My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me; because before him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, have I done no wrong."
27,6,23,"Then was the king exceedingly glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found on him, because he had trusted in his God."
27,6,24,"The king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions overpowered them, and broke all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den."
27,6,25,"Then king Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you."
27,6,26,"I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and steadfast forever. His kingdom shall not be destroyed; and his dominion shall be to the end."
27,6,27,"He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions."
27,6,28,"So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian."
27,7,1,"In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions in his mind on his bed. Then he wrote the dream and told the summary of it."
27,7,2,"Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the sky broke forth on the great sea."
27,7,3,"Four great animals came up from the sea, different from one another."
27,7,4,"The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings. I saw until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand on two feet as a man; and a man's mind was given to it."
27,7,5,"And behold, another animal, a second one, like a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. And they said this to it, 'Arise, devour much flesh.'"
27,7,6,"After this I saw, and behold, another one, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The animal also had four heads; and dominion was given to it."
27,7,7,"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth animal, awesome and powerful, and extremely strong. And it had great iron teeth. It devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped what was left with its feet. And it was diverse from all the animals that were before it; and it had ten horns."
27,7,8,"I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking arrogant things."
27,7,9,"I saw until thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool. His throne was fiery flames, and its wheels burning fire."
27,7,10,"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him. Thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court sat in judgment, and the books were opened."
27,7,11,"I saw at that time because of the voice of the arrogant words which the horn spoke. I was watching until the animal was killed and its body destroyed and was given to be burned with fire."
27,7,12,"As for the rest of the animals, their dominion was taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time."
27,7,13,"I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man, and he came even to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before him."
27,7,14,"There was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed."
27,7,15,"As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my mind troubled me."
27,7,16,"I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the true meaning concerning all this. So he told me, and revealed to me the interpretation of these things."
27,7,17,"These great animals, which are four, are four kings, who shall arise out of the earth."
27,7,18,"But the holy ones of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever."
27,7,19,"Then I desired to know the true meaning concerning the fourth animal, which was different from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its claws of bronze; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped what was left with its feet."
27,7,20,"And concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke arrogant things, whose look was larger than the others."
27,7,21,"I saw, and the same horn made war with the holy ones, and prevailed against them,"
27,7,22,"until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given to the holy ones of the Most High, and the time came that the holy ones possessed the kingdom."
27,7,23,"This he said, 'The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces."
27,7,24,"As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise, and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings."
27,7,25,"He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall oppress the holy ones of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given over to him until a time and times and half a time."
27,7,26,"And the court shall sit in judgment, and they shall take away his dominion, consumed and completely destroyed forever."
27,7,27,"The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.'"
27,7,28,"Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me greatly, and my face turned pale. I kept the matter to myself."
27,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me previously."
27,8,2,"And I saw in the vision, and when I looked, I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai."
27,8,3,"Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns. And the two horns were long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one came up last."
27,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no animals could stand before him, neither was there any who could deliver out of his hand. But he did according to his will, and became great."
27,8,5,"As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth, and did not touch the ground. And the goat had a prominent horn between his eyes."
27,8,6,"He came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and rushed at him in the fury of his power."
27,8,7,"I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns. And there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he threw him down to the ground and trampled on him, and there was no one who could deliver the ram from his power."
27,8,8,"The male goat became very strong. But when he was strong, the large horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four prominent horns toward the four winds of heaven."
27,8,9,"Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beautiful land."
27,8,10,"It grew so great that it reached to the host of heaven, and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled on them."
27,8,11,"And it magnified itself, even against the Prince of the host; and it took away from him the daily sacrifice, and the place of his sanctuary was thrown down."
27,8,12,"The host was given over to it together with the daily sacrifice because of transgression. And it cast down truth to the ground, and kept prospering."
27,8,13,"Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression that makes desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled?"
27,8,14,"He said to me, To two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be restored to its rightful state."
27,8,15,"It came about when I, Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it. And behold, there stood before me someone who appeared to be a man."
27,8,16,"I heard a man's voice between the banks of the Ulai, and called out and said, Gabriel, make this man understand the vision."
27,8,17,"So he came near where I stood, and when he came I was frightened, and fell prostrate. But he said to me, Understand, son of man, that the vision belongs to the time of the end."
27,8,18,"Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and stood me upright."
27,8,19,"He said, Behold, I will make you know what shall be in the latter time of wrath, for it belongs to the appointed time of the end."
27,8,20,"The ram which you saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia."
27,8,21,"The male goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn that is between his eyes is the first king."
27,8,22,"As for that which was broken, in the place where four stood up, four kingdoms shall arise out of his nation, but not with his power."
27,8,23,"In the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their full measure, a rash and deceitful king shall arise."
27,8,24,"His power shall be great, but not by his own strength; and he shall cause terrible destruction, and shall succeed in whatever he does. And he shall destroy the mighty and the holy people."
27,8,25,"Through his cunning he shall cause deceit to prosper by his influence, and he shall be great in his own mind, and without warning he shall destroy many. He shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be shattered, but not by human hands."
27,8,26,"The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true; but seal up the vision because it refers to many days from now."
27,8,27,"I, Daniel, was overcome, and was ill for days. Then I rose up, and carried out the king's business. And I was astonished by the vision, but there was no one to explain it."
27,9,1,"In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of Median descent, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans--"
27,9,2,"in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood from the books the number of the years about which the word of the"
27,9,3,"And I turned to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and petitions, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes."
27,9,4,"I prayed to the"
27,9,5,"We have sinned, and have done what is wrong and wicked, and have rebelled, even turning aside from your commandments and from your ordinances."
27,9,6,"Neither have we listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land."
27,9,7,"Lord, righteousness belongs to you, but to us open shame, as at this day, to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, who are near, and who are far off, through all the countries where you have driven them, because of their unfaithful deeds that they have committed against you."
27,9,8,"Lord, to us belongs open shame, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you."
27,9,9,"To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him."
27,9,10,"And have not obeyed the voice of the"
27,9,11,"Yes, all Israel has transgressed your law, and turned away, refusing to obey your voice. Therefore has the curse been poured out on us, and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God, for we have sinned against you."
27,9,12,"He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our rulers who ruled us, by bringing on us a great calamity; for under the whole heaven such has not been done as has been done on Jerusalem."
27,9,13,"As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this calamity has come on us. Yet have we not tried to gain the favor of the"
27,9,14,"Therefore has the"
27,9,15,"And now, Lord our God, who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have made a name for yourself, even to this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly."
27,9,16,"Lord, according to all your righteousness, let your anger and please let your wrath be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a reproach to all who are around us."
27,9,17,"Now therefore, our God, listen to the prayer of your servant, and to his petitions, and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake."
27,9,18,"My God, turn your ear, and hear; open your eyes, and see our desolation, and the city which is called by your name. For we do not present our petitions before you for our righteousness, but for your great mercy."
27,9,19,"Lord, hear! Lord, forgive! Lord, listen and take action! Do not delay, for your own sake, my God, because your city and your people are called by your name."
27,9,20,"While I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my petition before the"
27,9,21,"while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, came to me in my weariness about the time of the evening sacrifice."
27,9,22,"He instructed me, and talked with me, and said, Daniel, I have now come forth to give you wisdom and understanding."
27,9,23,"At the beginning of your petitions the commandment went forth, and I have come to tell you, for you are greatly loved. Therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision."
27,9,24,"Seventy weeks are decreed on your people and on your holy city, to put an end to the transgression, and to make an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy place."
27,9,25,"Know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem until the time of an anointed prince, there shall be seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks. It shall be built again, with open spaces and a moat, but in times of distress."
27,9,26,"After the sixty-two weeks an anointed one shall be cut off, and shall have nothing: and the people of the prince who shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and his end shall come with a flood, and until the end there shall be war; desolations are decreed."
27,9,27,"He shall make a firm covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who destroys, and even until a complete destruction, until the decreed end is poured out on the one who destroys."
27,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the word was true: a great war. And he understood the word, and had understanding of the vision."
27,10,2,"In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three whole weeks."
27,10,3,"I had no pleasing food, neither meat nor wine came into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were fulfilled."
27,10,4,"In the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is the Tigris,"
27,10,5,"I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, around his waist a belt made of pure gold from Uphaz."
27,10,6,"His body was like beryl, and his face like the appearance of lightning, and his eyes like flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude."
27,10,7,"I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men who were with me did not see the vision; but a great trembling fell on them, and they fled to hide themselves."
27,10,8,"So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my natural appearance grew deathly pale, and I retained no strength."
27,10,9,"Yet I heard the sound of his words, and when I heard the sound of his words, then I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground."
27,10,10,"Behold, a hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands."
27,10,11,"He said to me, Daniel, man greatly loved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright; for I have now been sent to you. And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling."
27,10,12,"Then said he to me, Do not be afraid, Daniel; for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. And I have come because of your words."
27,10,13,"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; but, behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was left there with the kings of Persia."
27,10,14,"Now I have come to make you understand what shall happen to your people in the latter days; for the vision refers to future days."
27,10,15,"And when he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground, and could not speak."
27,10,16,"And behold, one in the likeness of a human touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who stood before me, My lord, it is because of the vision anguish has come upon me, and I have no strength."
27,10,17,"For how can this servant of my lord talk with my lord? As for me, no strength remains, and I am breathless."
27,10,18,"Then one like the appearance of a man touched me again and strengthened me."
27,10,19,"And he said, Greatly loved man, do not be afraid, peace be to you; be strong, be strong!When he spoke to me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me."
27,10,20,"Then he said, Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia. When I go forth, behold, the prince of Greece shall come."
27,10,21,"But I will tell you that which is inscribed in the Book of Truth. And there is no one who contends with me against them except Michael, your prince."
27,11,1,"And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to support and strengthen him."
27,11,2,"And now what I show you is true. Behold, there shall arise three more kings in Persia, and the fourth shall be far richer than all of them; and when he has grown strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece."
27,11,3,"And a powerful king shall arise, who shall rule an extensive empire, and do as he pleases."
27,11,4,"When he shall arise, his kingdom shall be broken up, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his authority with which he ruled; for his kingdom shall be uprooted, and will go to others besides these."
27,11,5,"The king of the south shall grow strong, and one of his officers shall grow more powerful, and shall have a greater kingdom than his."
27,11,6,"At the end of years they shall join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain her power; neither shall his strength endure; but she shall be surrendered, and her attendants, and he who became the father of her, and he who supported her in those times."
27,11,7,"But out of a shoot from her roots shall arise in his place, who shall come against the army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail."
27,11,8,"Also their gods, with their molten images, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold, shall he carry captive into Egypt; and he shall withdraw for some years from the king of the north."
27,11,9,"And he shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land."
27,11,10,"And his sons shall wage war, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall advance and overflow and pass through, and they shall return and wage war, as far as his fortress."
27,11,11,"The king of the south shall be moved with rage and shall come forth and fight against him, even with the king of the north; and he shall raise a great multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand."
27,11,12,"The multitude shall be taken away, and his heart shall be exalted; and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail."
27,11,13,"The king of the north shall return, and shall raise a multitude greater than the former; and he shall advance after some years with a great army and with abundant supplies."
27,11,14,"And in those times many shall rise up against the king of the south: also the violent ones among your people shall rise up in confirmation of the vision; but they shall fail."
27,11,15,"So the king of the north shall come, and build up a siege mound and take a well-fortified city. And the forces of the south shall not prevail, neither his best troops, neither shall there be any strength to resist."
27,11,16,"But he who comes against him shall do as he pleases, and no one shall be able to withstand him. And he shall stand in the beautiful land, and destruction will be within his power."
27,11,17,"He shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and will reach an agreement with him which he shall put into effect. And he shall give him a daughter of women to send destruction on him; but it will not last or be to his advantage."
27,11,18,"After this shall he turn his face to the coastal regions, and shall capture many. But a commander shall bring his insolence to an end. In addition, he shall repay him for his insolence."
27,11,19,"Then he shall turn his attention toward the fortresses of his own land, but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found again."
27,11,20,"Then shall arise in his place one who shall send an exactor of tribute to pass through the kingdom to maintain its glory; but within few days he shall be destroyed, though not in anger nor in battle."
27,11,21,"In his place shall arise a despicable person, to whom the honor of kingship had not been given, but he shall come in a time of prosperity, and shall obtain the kingdom through deceit."
27,11,22,"And large armies shall be swept away and shattered before him, as well as the prince of the covenant."
27,11,23,"And after an alliance is made with him he shall work deceitfully; for he shall become strong with a small force."
27,11,24,"In a time of prosperity he shall come even on the richest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor their fathers; he shall distribute among them plunder, and spoil, and property. He shall devise plans against their strongholds, but only for a time."
27,11,25,"And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall wage war in battle with an extremely large and powerful army; but he shall not stand; for they shall devise plans against him."
27,11,26,"Yes, those who eat of his royal food shall seek to destroy him, and his army shall be swept away; and many shall fall slain."
27,11,27,"As for both these kings, their minds shall be fixed on evil, and they shall speak lies at the table; but it shall not succeed; for still the end shall be at the appointed time."
27,11,28,"Then shall he return into his land with great property; and his mind shall be against the holy covenant. And he shall take action, and then return to his own land."
27,11,29,"At the appointed time he shall return, and come into the south; but this time the outcome shall not be as it was before."
27,11,30,"For ships from Kittim shall come against him; therefore he shall be intimidated, and shall turn back, and be enraged against the holy covenant, and shall take action. He shall turn back, and show regard to those who forsake the holy covenant."
27,11,31,"Forces shall come at his order, and they shall profane the sanctuary and the fortress, and shall take away the daily burnt offering, and they shall set up the abomination that causes desolation."
27,11,32,"And those who act wickedly toward the covenant he shall corrupt by smooth words; but the people who know their God shall be strong, and take action."
27,11,33,"And those who are wise among the people shall instruct many; yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder for some time."
27,11,34,"Now when they shall fall, they shall receive a little help. And many shall join with them insincerely."
27,11,35,"Some of those who are wise shall fall, to be refined, purified and cleansed until the time of the end; for the appointed time is still to come."
27,11,36,"And the king shall do as he pleases. And he shall exalt and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak outrageous things against the God of gods. And he shall prosper until the indignation is accomplished; for that which is decreed shall be done."
27,11,37,"Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the one desired by women, nor show regard to any other god, because he shall magnify himself above all."
27,11,38,"But instead he shall honor the god of fortresses; a god whom his fathers did not know shall he honor with gold and silver, and with valuable stones, and costly gifts."
27,11,39,"And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god. Whoever acknowledges him he shall grant considerable honor; and he shall make them rulers over many, and shall divide the land for a price."
27,11,40,"And at the time of the end shall the king of the south attack him. And the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall invade countries, and pass through like a flood."
27,11,41,"He shall enter also into the beautiful land, and many countries shall be overthrown; but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the foremost of the sons of Ammon."
27,11,42,"He shall reach out his hand also on other countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape."
27,11,43,"But he shall have control over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the riches of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his feet."
27,11,44,"But news out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; and he shall go out with tremendous rage to destroy and utterly sweep away many."
27,11,45,"And he shall pitch his royal tents between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he shall come to his end, with no one to help him."
27,12,1,"At that time shall Michael arise, the great prince who watches over the children of your people. And there shall be a time of distress unparalleled since the beginning of the nation until that time. But at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone who shall be found written in the book."
27,12,2,"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."
27,12,3,"And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who turn many to righteousness like the stars forever and ever."
27,12,4,"But you, Daniel, close up these words, and seal the book, until the time of the end. Many shall roam here and there, and knowledge shall increase."
27,12,5,"Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others stood, one on this bank of the river, and one on the other bank of the river."
27,12,6,"And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, How long shall it be till these wonders take place?"
27,12,7,"I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him who lives forever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished."
27,12,8,"And I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, My lord, what shall be the outcome of these things?"
27,12,9,"And he said, Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end."
27,12,10,"Many shall be purified, cleansed and refined; but the wicked shall act wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but those who are wise shall understand."
27,12,11,"From the time that the daily sacrifice is taken away, and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred ninety days."
27,12,12,"Blessed is he who waits, and comes to the one thousand three hundred thirty-five days."
27,12,13,"But go your way until the end. For you shall rest, and shall rise to receive your reward at the end of the days."
28,1,1,"The word of the"
28,1,2,"When the"
28,1,3,"So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son."
28,1,4,"The"
28,1,5,"It will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel."
28,1,6,"She conceived again, and bore a daughter.Then he said to him, Call her name Lo-Ruhamah; for I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in any way pardon them."
28,1,7,"But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by the"
28,1,8,"Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son."
28,1,9,"He said, Call his name Lo-Ammi; for you are not my people, and I will not be yours."
28,1,10,"Yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can't be measured nor numbered; and it will come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'sons of the living God.'"
28,1,11,"The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint themselves one head, and will go up from the land; for great will be the day of Jezreel."
28,2,1,"Say to your brothers, 'My people!'and to your sisters, 'My loved one!'"
28,2,2,"Contend with your mother!Contend, for she is not my wife,neither am I her husband;and let her put away her prostitution from her face,and her adulteries from between her breasts;"
28,2,3,"Lest I strip her naked,and make her bare as in the day that she was born,and make her like a wilderness,and set her like a dry land,and kill her with thirst."
28,2,4,"Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy;for they are children of unfaithfulness;"
28,2,5,"For their mother has played the prostitute.She who conceived them has done shamefully;for she said, 'I will go after my lovers,who give me my bread and my water,my wool and my flax,my oil and my drink.'"
28,2,6,"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns,and I will build a wall against her,that she can't find her way."
28,2,7,"She will follow after her lovers,but she won't overtake them;and she will seek them,but won't find them.Then she will say, 'I will go and return to my first husband;for then was it better with me than now.'"
28,2,8,"For she did not know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil,and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal."
28,2,9,"Therefore I will take back my grain in its time,and my new wine in its season,and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness."
28,2,10,"Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,and no one will deliver her out of my hand."
28,2,11,"I will also cause all her celebrations to cease:her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies."
28,2,12,"I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,about which she has said, 'These are my wages that my lovers have given me;and I will make them a forest,'and the animals of the field shall eat them."
28,2,13,"I will visit on her the days of the Baals,to which she burned incense,when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels,and went after her lovers,and forgot me, says the"
28,2,14,"Therefore, behold, I will allure her,and bring her into the wilderness,and speak tenderly to her."
28,2,15,"I will give her vineyards from there,and the valley of Achor for a door of hope;and she will respond there,as in the days of her youth,and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt."
28,2,16,"It will be in that day, says the"
28,2,17,"For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth,and they will no longer be mentioned by name."
28,2,18,"In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals of the field,and with the birds of the sky,and with the creeping things of the ground.I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land,and will make them lie down safely."
28,2,19,"I will betroth you to me forever.Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion."
28,2,20,"I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness;and you shall know the"
28,2,21,"It will happen in that day, I will respond, says the"
28,2,22,"and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil;and they will respond to Jezreel."
28,2,23,"I will sow her to me in the earth;and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy;and I will tell those who were not my people, 'You are my people;'and they will say, 'My God!'"
28,3,1,"The"
28,3,2,"So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a half of barley."
28,3,3,"I said to her, You shall stay with me many days. You shall not play the prostitute, and you shall not be with any other man. I will also be so toward you."
28,3,4,"For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without sacred stone, and without ephod or idols."
28,3,5,"Afterward the children of Israel shall return, and seek the"
28,4,1,"Hear the word of the"
28,4,2,"There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery;they break boundaries, and bloodshed causes bloodshed."
28,4,3,"Therefore the land will mourn,and everyone who dwells therein will waste away,all living things in her,even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky;yes, the fish of the sea also die."
28,4,4,"Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse; For your people are like those who bring charges against a priest."
28,4,5,"You will stumble in the day,and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night;and I will destroy your mother."
28,4,6,"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you,that you may be no priest to me.Because you have forgotten your God's law,I will also forget your children."
28,4,7,"As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me.I will change their glory into shame."
28,4,8,"They feed on the sin of my people,and set their heart on their iniquity."
28,4,9,"It will be, like people, like priest;and I will punish them for their ways,and will repay them for their deeds."
28,4,10,"They will eat, and not have enough.They will play the prostitute, and will not increase;because they have abandoned giving to the"
28,4,11,"Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding."
28,4,12,"My people consult with their wooden idol,and answer to a stick of wood.Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray,and they have been unfaithful to their God."
28,4,13,"They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains,and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths,because its shade is good.Therefore your daughters play the prostitute,and your brides commit adultery."
28,4,14,"I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute,nor your brides when they commit adultery;because the men consort with prostitutes,and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes;so the people without understanding will come to ruin."
28,4,15,"Though you, Israel, play the prostitute,yet do not let Judah offend;and do not come to Gilgal,neither go up to Beth Aven,nor swear, 'As the"
28,4,16,"For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer.Then how will the"
28,4,17,"Ephraim is joined to idols.Leave him alone!"
28,4,18,"Their drink has become sour.They play the prostitute continually.Her rulers dearly love their shameful way."
28,4,19,"The wind has wrapped her up in its wings;and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices."
28,5,1,"Listen to this, you priests!Listen, house of Israel,and give ear, house of the king!For the judgment is against you;for you have been a snare at Mizpah,and a net spread on Tabor."
28,5,2,"The rebels are deep in slaughter;but I discipline all of them."
28,5,3,"I know Ephraim,and Israel is not hidden from me;for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute.Israel is defiled."
28,5,4,"Their deeds won't allow them to turn to their God;for the spirit of prostitution is within them,and they do not know the"
28,5,5,"The pride of Israel testifies to his face.Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity.Judah also will stumble with them."
28,5,6,"They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the"
28,5,7,"They are unfaithful to the"
28,5,8,"Blow the cornet in Gibeah,and the trumpet in Ramah!Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven, behind you, Benjamin!"
28,5,9,"Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke.Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which will surely be."
28,5,10,"The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark.I will pour out my wrath on them like water."
28,5,11,"Ephraim is oppressed,he is crushed in judgment;Because he is intent in his pursuit of idols."
28,5,12,"Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth,and to the house of Judah like rottenness."
28,5,13,"When Ephraim saw his sickness,and Judah his wound,Then Ephraim went to Assyria,and sent to king Jareb:but he is not able to heal you,neither will he cure you of your wound."
28,5,14,"For I will be to Ephraim like a lion,and like a young lion to the house of Judah.I myself will tear in pieces and go away.I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver."
28,5,15,"I will go and return to my place,until they acknowledge their offense,and seek my face.In their affliction they will seek me earnestly."
28,6,1,"Come, and let us return to the"
28,6,2,"After two days he will revive us.On the third day he will raise us up,and we will live before him."
28,6,3,"Let us acknowledge the"
28,6,4,"Ephraim, what shall I do to you?Judah, what shall I do to you?For your love is like a morning cloud,and like the dew that disappears early."
28,6,5,"Therefore I have cut them to pieces with the prophets;I killed them with the words of my mouth.Your judgments are like a flash of lightning."
28,6,6,"For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice;and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings."
28,6,7,"But they, like Adam, have broken the covenant.They were unfaithful to me, there."
28,6,8,"Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity;it is stained with blood."
28,6,9,"As gangs of robbers wait to ambush a man,so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem,committing shameful crimes."
28,6,10,"In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing.There is prostitution in Ephraim.Israel is defiled."
28,6,11,"Also, Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you,when I restore the fortunes of my people."
28,7,1,"When I would heal Israel,then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered,also the wickedness of Samaria;for they commit falsehood,and the thief enters in,and the gang of robbers ravages outside."
28,7,2,"They do not consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness.Now their own deeds have engulfed them.They are before my face."
28,7,3,"They make the king glad with their wickedness,and the princes with their lies."
28,7,4,"They are all adulterers.They are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring,from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened."
28,7,5,"On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine.He joined his hand with mockers."
28,7,6,"For they have made ready their heart like an oven,while they lie in wait.Their baker sleeps all the night.In the morning it burns as a flaming fire."
28,7,7,"They are all hot as an oven,and devour their judges.All their kings have fallen.There is no one among them who calls to me."
28,7,8,"Ephraim, he mixes himself among the nations.Ephraim is a pancake not turned over."
28,7,9,"Strangers have devoured his strength,and he doesn't realize it.Indeed, gray hairs are here and there on him,and he doesn't realize it."
28,7,10,"The pride of Israel testifies to his face;yet they haven't returned to the"
28,7,11,"Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding.They call to Egypt.They go to Assyria."
28,7,12,"When they go, I will spread my net on them.I will bring them down like the birds of the sky.I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard."
28,7,13,"Woe to them!For they have wandered from me.Destruction to them!For they have trespassed against me.Though I would redeem them,yet they have spoken lies against me."
28,7,14,"They haven't cried to me with their heart,but they howl on their beds.They assemble themselves for grain and new wine.They turn away from me."
28,7,15,"Though I have taught and strengthened their arms,yet they plot evil against me."
28,7,16,"They return, but not to the Most High.They are like a faulty bow.Their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue.This will be their derision in the land of Egypt."
28,8,1,"Put the trumpet to your lips!Something like an eagle is over the"
28,8,2,"They cry to me, 'My God, we Israel acknowledge you!'"
28,8,3,"Israel has cast off that which is good.The enemy will pursue him."
28,8,4,"They have set up kings, but not by me.They have made princes, and I did not approve.Of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols,that they may be cut off."
28,8,5,"Let Samaria throw out his calf idol!My anger burns against them!How long will it be until they are capable of purity?"
28,8,6,"For this is even from Israel!The workman made it, and it is no God;indeed, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces."
28,8,7,"For they sow the wind,and they will reap the whirlwind.He has no standing grain.The stalk will yield no head.If it does yield, strangers will swallow it up."
28,8,8,"Israel is swallowed up.Now they are among the nations like a worthless thing."
28,8,9,"For they have gone up to Assyria,like a wild donkey wandering alone.Ephraim has hired lovers for himself."
28,8,10,"But although they sold themselves among the nations,I will now gather them;and they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones."
28,8,11,"Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning,they became for him altars for sinning."
28,8,12,"I wrote for him the many things of my law;but they were regarded as a strange thing."
28,8,13,"As for the sacrifices of my offerings,they sacrifice flesh and eat it;But the"
28,8,14,"For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces;and Judah has multiplied fortified cities;but I will send a fire on his cities,and it will devour its fortresses."
28,9,1,"Do not rejoice, Israel, to jubilation like the nations;for you were unfaithful to your God.You love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor."
28,9,2,"The threshing floor and the winepress won't feed them,and the new wine will fail her."
28,9,3,"They won't dwell in the"
28,9,4,"They won't pour out wine offerings to the"
28,9,5,"What will you do in the day of solemn assembly,and in the day of the feast of the"
28,9,6,"For, behold, they have gone away from destruction.Egypt will gather them up.Memphis will bury them.Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver.Thorns will be in their tents."
28,9,7,"The days of visitation have come.The days of reckoning have come.Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool,and the man who is inspired to be insane,because of the abundance of your sins,and because your hostility is great."
28,9,8,"A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God.A fowler's snare is on all of his paths,and hostility in the house of his God."
28,9,9,"They have deeply corrupted themselves,as in the days of Gibeah.He will remember their iniquity.He will punish them for their sins."
28,9,10,"I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season;but they came to Baal Peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing,and became abominable like that which they loved."
28,9,11,"As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird.There will be no birth, none with child, and no conception."
28,9,12,"Though they bring up their children,yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be left.Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them!"
28,9,13,"I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place;but Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer."
28,9,14,"Give them-"
28,9,15,"All their wickedness is in Gilgal;for there I hated them.Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house!I will love them no more.All their princes are rebels."
28,9,16,"Ephraim is struck.Their root has dried up.They will bear no fruit.Even though they bring forth, yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb."
28,9,17,"My God will cast them away, because they did not listen to him;and they will be wanderers among the nations."
28,10,1,"Israel is a luxuriant vine that puts forth his fruit.According to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars.As their land has prospered, they have adorned their sacred stones."
28,10,2,"Their heart is divided.Now they will be found guilty.He will demolish their altars.He will destroy their sacred stones."
28,10,3,"Surely now they will say, We have no king; for we do not fear the"
28,10,4,"They make promises, swearing falsely in making covenants.Therefore judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field."
28,10,5,"The inhabitants of Samaria will be in terror for the calves of Beth Aven;for its people will mourn over it,Along with its priests who rejoiced over it,for its glory, because it has departed from it."
28,10,6,"It also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king.Ephraim will receive shame,and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel."
28,10,7,"Samaria and her king float away,like a twig on the water."
28,10,8,"The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed.The thorn and the thistle will come up on their altars.They will tell the mountains, Cover us! and the hills, Fall on us!"
28,10,9,"Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah.There they remained.The battle against the children of iniquity doesn't overtake them in Gibeah."
28,10,10,"When it is my desire, I will chastise them;and the nations will be gathered against them,when they are bound to their two transgressions."
28,10,11,"Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh;so I will put a yoke on her beautiful neck.I will set a rider on Ephraim.Judah will plow.Jacob will break his clods."
28,10,12,"Sow to yourselves in righteousness,reap according to kindness.Break up your fallow ground;for it is time to seek the"
28,10,13,"You have plowed wickedness.You have reaped iniquity.You have eaten the fruit of lies,for you trusted in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men."
28,10,14,"Therefore a battle roar will arise among your people,and all your fortresses will be destroyed,as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle.The mother was dashed in pieces with her children."
28,10,15,"So Bethel will do to you because of your great wickedness.At daybreak the king of Israel will be destroyed."
28,11,1,"When Israel was a child, then I loved him,and out of Egypt I called my son."
28,11,2,"They called to them, so they went from them.They sacrificed to the Baals,and burned incense to engraved images."
28,11,3,"Yet I taught Ephraim to walk.I took them by his arms;but they did not know that I healed them."
28,11,4,"I drew them with cords of a man, with ties of love;and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks;and I bent down to him and I fed him."
28,11,5,"They won't return into the land of Egypt;but the Assyrian will be their king,because they refused to repent."
28,11,6,"The sword will fall on their cities,and will destroy the bars of their gates,and will put an end to their plans."
28,11,7,"My people are determined to turn from me.Though they call to the Most High,he certainly won't exalt them."
28,11,8,"How can I give you up, Ephraim?How can I hand you over, Israel?How can I make you like Admah?How can I make you like Zeboiim?My heart is turned within me,my compassion is aroused."
28,11,9,"I will not execute the fierceness of my anger.I will not return to destroy Ephraim:for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of you;and I will not come in wrath."

28,12,5,"even the"
28,12,6,"Therefore turn to your God.Keep kindness and justice,and wait continually for your God."
28,12,7,"A merchant has dishonest scales in his hand.He loves to defraud."

28,12,11,"If Gilead is wicked,surely they are worthless.In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls.Indeed, their altars are like heaps in the furrows of the field."
28,12,12,"Jacob fled into the country of Aram,and Israel served to get a wife,and for a wife he tended flocks and herds."
28,12,13,"By a prophet the"
28,12,14,"Ephraim has bitterly provoked anger.Therefore his blood will be left on him,and his Lord will repay his contempt."
28,13,1,"When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling.He exalted himself in Israel,but when he became guilty in Baal, he died."
28,13,2,"Now they sin more and more,and have made themselves molten images of their silver,even idols according to their own understanding,all of them the work of the craftsmen.They say of them, 'They offer human sacrifice and kiss the calves.'"
28,13,3,"Therefore they will be like the morning mist,and like the dew that passes away early,like the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor,and like the smoke out of the chimney."
28,13,4,"Yet I am the"

28,13,6,"According to their pasture, so were they filled;they were filled, and their heart was exalted.Therefore they have forgotten me."
28,13,7,"Therefore I am like a lion to them.Like a leopard, I will lurk by the path."
28,13,8,"I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs,and will tear the covering of their heart.There I will devour them like a lioness.The wild animal will tear them."
28,13,9,"You are destroyed, Israel, because you are against me,against your help."
28,13,10,"Where is your king now, that he may save you in all your cities?And your judges, of whom you said, 'Give me a king and princes?'"
28,13,11,"I have given you a king in my anger,and have taken him away in my wrath."
28,13,12,"The guilt of Ephraim is stored up.His sin is stored up."
28,13,13,"The sorrows of a travailing woman will come on him.He is an unwise son;for when it is time, he doesn't come to the opening of the womb."
28,13,14,"I will ransom them from the power of Sheol.I will redeem them from death!Death, where are your plagues?Sheol, where is your sting?Compassion will be hidden from my eyes."
28,13,15,"Though he is fruitful among his brothers, an east wind will come,the breath of the"
28,13,16,"Samaria will bear her guilt;for she has rebelled against her God.They will fall by the sword.Their infants will be dashed in pieces,and their pregnant women will be ripped open."
28,14,1,"Israel, return to the"

28,14,5,"I will be like the dew to Israel.He will blossom like the lily,and send down his roots like Lebanon."
28,14,6,"His branches will spread,and his beauty will be like the olive tree,and his fragrance like Lebanon."
28,14,7,"Men will dwell in his shade.They will revive like the grain,and blossom like the vine.Their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon."
28,14,8,"Ephraim, what have I to do any more with idols?I answer, and will take care of him.I am like a green fir tree;from me your fruit is found."

29,1,4,"What the swarming locust has left, the great locust has eaten.What the great locust has left, the grasshopper has eaten.What the grasshopper has left, the caterpillar has eaten."
29,1,5,"Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!Wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine;for it is cut off from your mouth."
29,1,6,"For a nation has come up on my land, strong, and without number.His teeth are the teeth of a lion,and he has the fangs of a lioness."
29,1,7,"He has laid my vine waste,and stripped my fig tree.He has stripped its bark, and thrown it away.Its branches are made white."
29,1,8,"Mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth for the husband of her youth!"
29,1,9,"The meal offering and the drink offering are cut off from the"
29,1,10,"The field is laid waste.The land mourns, for the grain is destroyed,The new wine has dried up,and the oil languishes."
29,1,11,"Be confounded, you farmers!Wail, you vineyard keepers;for the wheat and for the barley;for the harvest of the field has perished."
29,1,12,"The vine has dried up, and the fig tree withered;the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree,even all of the trees of the field are withered;for joy has withered away from the sons of men."
29,1,13,"Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests!Wail, you ministers of the altar.Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God,for the meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from your God's house."

29,1,17,"The seeds rot under their clods.The granaries are laid desolate.The barns are broken down, for the grain has withered."
29,1,18,"How the animals groan!The herds of livestock are perplexed, because they have no pasture.Yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate."
29,1,19,"The"
29,1,20,"Yes, the animals of the field pant to you,for the water brooks have dried up,And the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness."
29,2,1,"Blow the trumpet in Zion,and sound an alarm in my holy mountain!Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,for the day of the"
29,2,2,"A day of darkness and gloominess,a day of clouds and thick darkness.As the dawn spreading on the mountains,a great and strong people;there has never been the like,neither will there be any more after them,even to the years of many generations."
29,2,3,"A fire devours before them,and behind them, a flame burns.The land is as the garden of Eden before them,and behind them, a desolate wilderness.Yes, and no one has escaped them."
29,2,4,"The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses,and as horsemen, so do they run."
29,2,5,"Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap,like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble,as a strong people set in battle array."
29,2,6,"At their presence the peoples are in anguish.All faces have grown pale."
29,2,7,"They run like mighty men.They climb the wall like warriors.They each march in his line, and they do not swerve off course."
29,2,8,"Neither does one jostle another;they march everyone in his path,and they burst through the defenses,and do not break ranks."
29,2,9,"They rush on the city.They run on the wall.They climb up into the houses.They enter in at the windows like thieves."

29,3,5,"Because you have taken my silver and my gold,and have carried my finest treasures into your temples,"
29,3,6,"and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks,that you may remove them far from their border."
29,3,7,"Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them,and will return your repayment on your own head;"

30,7,10,"Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words."
30,7,11,"For Amos says, 'Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.'"
30,7,12,"Amaziah also said to Amos, You seer, go, flee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:"
30,7,13,"but do not prophesy again any more at Bethel; for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a royal house!"
30,7,14,"Then Amos answered Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was a herdsman, and a farmer of sycamore figs;"

30,8,5,"Saying, 'When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain?And the Sabbath, that we may market wheat,making the ephah small, and the shekel large,and dealing falsely with balances of deceit;"
30,8,6,"that we may buy the poor for silver,and the needy for a pair of shoes,and sell the sweepings with the wheat?'"
30,8,7,"The"
30,8,8,"Won't the land tremble for this,and everyone mourn who dwells in it?Yes, it will rise up wholly like the River;and it will be stirred up and sink again, like the River of Egypt."
30,8,9,"It will happen in that day, says the Lord"
30,8,10,"I will turn your feasts into mourning,and all your songs into lamentation;and I will make you wear sackcloth on all your bodies,and baldness on every head.I will make it like the mourning for an only son,and its end like a bitter day."
30,8,11,"Behold, the days come, says the Lord"
30,8,12,"They will wander from sea to sea,and from the north even to the east;they will run back and forth to seek the word of the"

30,8,14,"Those who swear by the sin of Samaria,and say, 'As your god, Dan, lives;'and, 'As the way of Beersheba lives;'they will fall, and never rise up again."
30,9,1,"I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said, Strike the tops of the pillars, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will kill the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape."
30,9,2,"Though they dig into Sheol, there my hand will take them; and though they climb up to heaven, there I will bring them down."
30,9,3,"Though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out there; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent, and it will bite them."
30,9,4,"Though they go into captivity before their enemies, there I will command the sword, and it will kill them. I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good."
30,9,5,"For the Lord, the"

30,9,10,"All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, 'Evil won't overtake nor meet us.'"
30,9,11,"In that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen, and close up its breaches, and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;"

31,1,6,"How Esau will be ransacked! How his hidden treasures are sought out!"
31,1,7,"All the men of your alliance have brought you on your way, even to the border. The men who were at peace with you have deceived you, and prevailed against you. Friends who eat your bread lay a snare under you. There is no understanding in him."
31,1,8,"Won't I in that day, says the"

31,1,11,"In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots for Jerusalem, even you were like one of them."
31,1,12,"But do not look down on your brother in the day of his disaster, and do not rejoice over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction. Do not speak proudly in the day of distress."

31,1,17,"But in Mount Zion, there will be those who escape, and it will be holy. The house of Jacob will possess their possessions."
31,1,18,"The house of Jacob will be a fire, the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble. They will burn among them, and devour them. There will not be any remaining to the house of Esau. Indeed, the"

32,1,5,"Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god. They threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea, to lighten it. But Jonah had gone down into the innermost parts of the ship, and he was laying down, and was fast asleep."
32,1,6,"So the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, call on your God! Maybe your God will notice us, so that we won't perish."
32,1,7,"They all said to each other, Come, let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is on us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah."
32,1,8,"Then they asked him, Tell us, please, for whose cause this evil is on us. What is your occupation? Where do you come from? What is your country? Of what people are you?"
32,1,9,"He said to them, I am a Hebrew, and I fear the"
32,1,10,"Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said to him, What is this that you have done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the"
32,1,11,"Then said they to him, What shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us? For the sea grew more and more stormy."
32,1,12,"He said to them, Take me up, and throw me into the sea. Then the sea will be calm for you; for I know that because of me this great storm is on you."
32,1,13,"Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not, for the sea grew more and more stormy against them."
32,1,14,"Therefore they cried to the"
32,1,15,"So they took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea ceased its raging."

32,2,4,"I said, 'I have been banished from your sight;yet I will look again toward your holy temple.'"
32,2,5,"The waters surrounded me,even to the soul.The deep was around me.The weeds were wrapped around my head."
32,2,6,"I went down to the bottoms of the mountains.The earth barred me in forever:yet have you brought up my life from the pit,"
32,2,7,"When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the"

32,3,3,"So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the"
32,3,4,"Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried out, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!"
32,3,5,"The people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them."
32,3,6,"The news reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and took off his royal robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes."
32,3,7,"He made a proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor animal, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water;"
32,3,8,"but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and animal, and let them cry mightily to God. Yes, let them turn everyone from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands."
32,3,9,"Who knows whether God will not turn and relent, and turn away from his fierce anger, so that we might not perish?"
32,3,10,"God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way. God relented of the disaster which he said he would do to them, and he did not do it."
32,4,1,"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry."
32,4,2,"He prayed to the"
32,4,3,"Therefore now,"
32,4,4,"The"
32,4,5,"Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made himself a booth, and sat under it in the shade, until he might see what would become of the city."
32,4,6,"The"
32,4,7,"But God prepared a worm at dawn the next day, and it chewed on the vine, so that it withered."
32,4,8,"It happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah's head, so that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live."

32,4,10,"The"
32,4,11,"Shouldn't I be concerned for Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred twenty thousand persons who can't discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much livestock?"

33,1,5,"All this is for the disobedience of Jacob,and for the sins of the house of Israel.What is the disobedience of Jacob?Isn't it Samaria?And what are the high places of Judah?Aren't they Jerusalem?"
33,1,6,"Therefore I will make Samaria like a rubble heap of the field,like places for planting vineyards;and I will pour down its stones into the valley,and I will uncover its foundations."
33,1,7,"All her idols will be beaten to pieces,and all her temple gifts will be burned with fire,and all her images I will destroy;for of the hire of a prostitute has she gathered them,and to the hire of a prostitute shall they return."
33,1,8,"For this I will lament and wail;I will go stripped and naked;I will howl like the jackals,and moan like the daughters of owls."
33,1,9,"For her wounds are incurable;for it has come even to Judah.It reaches to the gate of my people,even to Jerusalem."

33,2,10,"Arise, and depart!For this is not your resting place,because of uncleanness that destroys,even with a grievous destruction."
33,2,11,"If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies:I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink;he would be the prophet of this people."
33,2,12,"I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you;I will surely gather the remnant of Israel;I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,as a flock in the midst of their pasture;they will swarm with people."

38,4,13,"He answered me, Do you not know what these are?I said, No, my lord."
38,4,14,"Then he said, These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth."
38,5,1,"Then again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a flying scroll."

38,5,8,"He said, This is Wickedness; and he threw her down into the midst of the ephah basket; and he threw the weight of lead on its mouth."
38,5,9,"Then lifted I up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there were two women, and the wind was in their wings. Now they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah basket between earth and the sky."
38,5,10,"Then said I to the angel who talked with me, Where are these carrying the ephah basket?"
38,5,11,"He said to me, To build her a house in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, she will be set there in her own place."
38,6,1,"Again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass."

40,1,9,"and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah;"
40,1,10,"and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah,"
40,1,11,"and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the exile to Babylon."
40,1,12,"And after the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,"
40,1,13,"and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, and Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor,"
40,1,14,"and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud,"
40,1,15,"and Eliud the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob,"
40,1,16,"and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called the Messiah."
40,1,17,"So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations."
40,1,18,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this; for after his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit."
40,1,19,"And Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly."
40,1,20,"But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the"
40,1,21,"And she will bring forth a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins."
40,1,22,"Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the"
40,1,23,"Behold, the virgin shall be with child,and shall bring forth a son.They shall call his name Immanuel;which is, being interpreted, God with us."
40,1,24,"And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the"
40,1,25,"and had no marital relations with her until she had brought forth a son; and he named him Jesus."
40,2,1,"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,"
40,2,2,"Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him."
40,2,3,"And when King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him."
40,2,4,"And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Messiah would be born."
40,2,5,"And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written through the prophet,"
40,2,6,"'And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah,are in no way least among the princes of Judah:for out of you shall come forth a ruler,who shall shepherd my people, Israel.'"
40,2,7,"Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared."
40,2,8,"And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child, and when you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him."
40,2,9,"And they, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was."
40,2,10,"And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy."
40,2,11,"And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh."
40,2,12,"Being warned in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way."
40,2,13,"Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the"
40,2,14,"And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,"
40,2,15,"and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the"
40,2,16,"Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men."
40,2,17,"Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,"
40,2,18,"A voice was heard in Ramah,weeping and great mourning,Rachel weeping for her children;and she would not be comforted,because they are no more."
40,2,19,"But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the"
40,2,20,"Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child's life are dead."
40,2,21,"And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel."
40,2,22,"But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee,"
40,2,23,"and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, that he will be called a Nazorean."
40,3,1,"And in those days John the Baptist came, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea, saying,"
40,3,2,"Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near!"
40,3,3,"For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying,The voice of one crying in the wilderness,make ready the way of the"
40,3,4,"Now John himself wore clothing made of camel's hair and with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey."
40,3,5,"Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him,"
40,3,6,"and they were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins."
40,3,7,"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism he said to them, You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
40,3,8,"Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance,"
40,3,9,"and do not think to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones."
40,3,10,"And even now the axe lies at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire."
40,3,11,"I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but the one who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and with fire."
40,3,12,"His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire."
40,3,13,"Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him."
40,3,14,"But John would have hindered him, saying, I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?"
40,3,15,"But Jesus, answering, said to him, Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allowed him."
40,3,16,"And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him."
40,3,17,"And behold, a voice out of the heavens said, This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
40,4,1,"Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil."
40,4,2,"And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward."
40,4,3,"And the tempter came and said to him, If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
40,4,4,"But he answered, It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'"
40,4,5,"Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,"
40,4,6,"and said to him, If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will put his angels in charge of you.' and,'On their hands they will bear you up,so that you do not dash your foot against a stone.'"
40,4,7,"Jesus said to him, Again, it is written, 'You shall not test the"
40,4,8,"Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory."
40,4,9,"And he said to him, I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me."
40,4,10,"Then Jesus said to him, Go away, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the"
40,4,11,"Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him."
40,4,12,"Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee."
40,4,13,"And leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,"
40,4,14,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,"
40,4,15,"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,Galilee of the Gentiles,"
40,4,16,"the people who sat in darkness saw a great light, andto those who sat in the region and shadow of death,to them light has dawned."
40,4,17,"From that time, Jesus began to proclaim, and to say, Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is near."
40,4,18,"And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers: Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen."
40,4,19,"And he said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers for men."
40,4,20,"And they immediately left their nets and followed him."
40,4,21,"Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them."
40,4,22,"And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him."
40,4,23,"And he went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people."
40,4,24,"And the report about him went out into all Syria, and they brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them."
40,4,25,"And great multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan followed him."
40,5,1,"And seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain, and when he had sat down, his disciples came to him."
40,5,2,"Then he opened his mouth and taught them, saying,"
40,5,3,"Blessed are the poor in spirit,for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven."
40,5,4,"Blessed are those who mourn,for they shall be comforted."
40,5,5,"Blessed are the gentle,for they shall inherit the earth."
40,5,6,"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness,for they shall be filled."
40,5,7,"Blessed are the merciful,for they shall obtain mercy."
40,5,8,"Blessed are the pure in heart,for they shall see God."
40,5,9,"Blessed are the peacemakers,for they shall be called sons of God."
40,5,10,"Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake,for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven."
40,5,11,"Blessed are you when men insult you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake."
40,5,12,"Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you."
40,5,13,"You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men."
40,5,14,"You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill cannot be hidden."
40,5,15,"Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house."
40,5,16,"Even so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven."
40,5,17,"Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy, but to fulfill."
40,5,18,"For truly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the Law, until all things are accomplished."
40,5,19,"Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven."
40,5,20,"For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven."
40,5,21,"You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, 'You shall not murder;' and 'Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment.'"
40,5,22,"But I tell you, that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, 'You good-for-nothing!' shall be in danger of the council; and whoever shall say, 'You fool!' shall be in danger of the fire of hell."
40,5,23,"If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,"
40,5,24,"leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift."
40,5,25,"Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him in the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison."
40,5,26,"Truly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last penny."
40,5,27,"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery;'"
40,5,28,"but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart."
40,5,29,"And if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell."
40,5,30,"And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell."
40,5,31,"It was also said, 'Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,'"
40,5,32,"but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery."
40,5,33,"Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time, 'You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the"
40,5,34,"but I tell you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;"
40,5,35,"nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King."
40,5,36,"Neither shall you swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black."
40,5,37,"But let your 'Yes' be 'Yes' and your 'No' be 'No.' Whatever is more than these is of the evil one."
40,5,38,"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'"
40,5,39,"But I tell you, do not resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also."
40,5,40,"And if anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also."
40,5,41,"And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two."
40,5,42,"Give to him who asks you, and do not turn away him who desires to borrow from you."
40,5,43,"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.'"
40,5,44,"But I tell you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,"
40,5,45,"that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust."
40,5,46,"For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?"
40,5,47,"And if you only greet your brothers, what more do you do than others? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?"
40,5,48,"Therefore you shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
40,6,1,"Be careful that you do not do your acts of charity before men, to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven."
40,6,2,"Therefore when you do merciful deeds, do not sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get glory from people. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward."
40,6,3,"But when you do merciful deeds, do not let your left hand know what your right hand does,"
40,6,4,"so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your Father who sees in secret will reward you."
40,6,5,"And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward."
40,6,6,"But you, when you pray, enter into your inner chamber, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you."
40,6,7,"And in praying, do not use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking."
40,6,8,"Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows what things you need, before you ask him."
40,6,9,"Pray like this:'Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy."
40,6,10,"Let your Kingdom come. Let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
40,6,11,"Give us today our daily bread."
40,6,12,"And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors."
40,6,13,"Let us not come into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. [For yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen.]'"
40,6,14,"For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you."
40,6,15,"But if you do not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
40,6,16,"Moreover when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with sad faces. For they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward."
40,6,17,"But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;"
40,6,18,"so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you."
40,6,19,"Do not lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;"
40,6,20,"but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves do not break through and steal;"
40,6,21,"for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
40,6,22,"The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light."
40,6,23,"But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!"
40,6,24,"No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Mammon."
40,6,25,"Therefore, I tell you, do not be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?"
40,6,26,"See the birds of the sky, that they do not sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of much more value than they?"
40,6,27,"And which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment to his lifespan?"
40,6,28,"And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They do not toil, neither do they spin,"
40,6,29,"yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these."
40,6,30,"But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won't he much more clothe you, you of little faith?"
40,6,31,"Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What will we eat?', 'What will we drink?' or, 'With what will we be clothed?'"
40,6,32,"For the Gentiles seek after all these things, for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things."
40,6,33,"But seek first his Kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well."
40,6,34,"Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
40,7,1,"Do not judge, so that you won't be judged."
40,7,2,"For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you."
40,7,3,"And why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not consider the log that is in your own eye?"
40,7,4,"Or how will you tell your brother, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye;' and behold, the log is in your own eye?"
40,7,5,"You hypocrite! First remove the log out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother's eye."
40,7,6,"Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, neither throw your pearls before the pigs, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces."
40,7,7,"Ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened for you."
40,7,8,"For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened."
40,7,9,"Or who is there among you, who, if his son will ask him for bread, will give him a stone?"
40,7,10,"Or if he will ask for a fish, who will give him a serpent?"
40,7,11,"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!"
40,7,12,"Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets."
40,7,13,"Enter in by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter in by it."
40,7,14,"How narrow is the gate, and difficult is the way that leads to life! Few are those who find it."
40,7,15,"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves."
40,7,16,"By their fruits you will know them. Do you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?"
40,7,17,"Even so, every good tree produces good fruit; but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit."
40,7,18,"A good tree cannot produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit."
40,7,19,"Every tree that does not grow good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire."
40,7,20,"Therefore, by their fruits you will know them."
40,7,21,"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."
40,7,22,"Many will tell me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, did not we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty works?'"
40,7,23,"And then I will tell them, 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work iniquity.'"
40,7,24,"Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, will be compared to a wise man, who built his house on a rock."
40,7,25,"And the rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock."
40,7,26,"And everyone who hears these words of mine, and does not do them will be like a foolish man, who built his house on the sand."
40,7,27,"And the rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell-and great was its fall."
40,7,28,"And it happened, when Jesus had finished saying these things, that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,"
40,7,29,"for he taught them with authority, and not like their scribes."
40,8,1,"And when he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him."
40,8,2,"And behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying, Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean."
40,8,3,"And he stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, I want to. Be made clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed."
40,8,4,"And Jesus said to him, See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
40,8,5,"And when he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him,"
40,8,6,"and saying, Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented."
40,8,7,"And he said to him, I will come and heal him."
40,8,8,"And the centurion answered, Lord, I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
40,8,9,"For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and tell another, 'Come,' and he comes; and tell my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
40,8,10,"And when Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, Truly I tell you, I have not found so great a faith with anyone in Israel."
40,8,11,"And I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,"
40,8,12,"but the sons of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40,8,13,"And Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed. And his servant was healed in that hour."
40,8,14,"And when Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick with a fever."
40,8,15,"So he touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and served him."
40,8,16,"And when evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick;"
40,8,17,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases."
40,8,18,"Now when Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side."
40,8,19,"Then a scribe came, and said to him, Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
40,8,20,"And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
40,8,21,"And another of the disciples said to him, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father."
40,8,22,"But Jesus said to him, Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."
40,8,23,"And when he got into a boat, his disciples followed him."
40,8,24,"And behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was asleep."
40,8,25,"They came to him, and woke him up, saying, Save us, Lord! We are dying!"
40,8,26,"And he said to them, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm."
40,8,27,"And the men marveled, saying, What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
40,8,28,"And when he came to the other side, into the country of the Gadarenes, two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way."
40,8,29,"And behold, they shouted, saying, What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
40,8,30,"Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them."
40,8,31,"And the demons begged him, saying, If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs."
40,8,32,"And he said to them, Go!And they came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water."
40,8,33,"And those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons."
40,8,34,"And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders."
40,9,1,"And he entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his own city."
40,9,2,"And behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Son, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven."
40,9,3,"And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, This man blasphemes."
40,9,4,"But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why do you think evil in your hearts?"
40,9,5,"For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Get up, and walk?'"
40,9,6,"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins... (then he said to the paralytic), Get up, and take up your mat, and go up to your house."
40,9,7,"And he arose and departed to his house."
40,9,8,"But when the multitudes saw it, they were filled with awe and glorified God, who had given such authority to men."
40,9,9,"And as Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office. He said to him, Follow me. And he got up and followed him."
40,9,10,"And it happened as he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples."
40,9,11,"And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
40,9,12,"When he heard it, he said to them, Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do."
40,9,13,"But you go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."
40,9,14,"Then John's disciples came to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
40,9,15,"And Jesus said to them, Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast."
40,9,16,"And no one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made."
40,9,17,"Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined. No, they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved."
40,9,18,"While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
40,9,19,"And Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples."
40,9,20,"And behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment;"
40,9,21,"for she said within herself, If I just touch his garment, I will be made well."
40,9,22,"But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, Daughter, cheer up! Your faith has made you well. And the woman was made well from that hour."
40,9,23,"And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy disorder,"
40,9,24,"he said, Make room, because the girl is not dead, but sleeping.They were ridiculing him."
40,9,25,"But when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose."
40,9,26,"And the report of this went out into all that land."
40,9,27,"And as Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, Have mercy on us, son of David!"
40,9,28,"And when he had come into the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this?They told him, Yes, Lord."
40,9,29,"Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done to you."
40,9,30,"And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly commanded them, saying, See that no one knows about this."
40,9,31,"But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land."
40,9,32,"And as they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him."
40,9,33,"And when the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!"
40,9,34,"But the Pharisees said, By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons."
40,9,35,"And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness."
40,9,36,"But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd."
40,9,37,"Then he said to his disciples, The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
40,9,38,"Pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest."
40,10,1,"And he called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness."
40,10,2,"Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; and Andrew his brother; and Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;"
40,10,3,"Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; Jacob the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;"
40,10,4,"Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him."
40,10,5,"Jesus sent these twelve out, and commanded them, saying, Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans."
40,10,6,"Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
40,10,7,"And as you go, proclaim, saying, 'The Kingdom of Heaven is near!'"
40,10,8,"Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons. Freely you received, so freely give."
40,10,9,"Do not take any gold, nor silver, nor brass in your money belts."
40,10,10,"Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food."
40,10,11,"And into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on."
40,10,12,"And as you enter into the household, greet it."
40,10,13,"And if the household is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you."
40,10,14,"And whoever does not receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake off the dust from your feet."
40,10,15,"Truly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city."
40,10,16,"Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves."
40,10,17,"But beware of people: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you."
40,10,18,"Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations."
40,10,19,"But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say."
40,10,20,"For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you."
40,10,21,"And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death."
40,10,22,"And you will be hated by all men for my name's sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved."
40,10,23,"But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for truly I tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man has come."
40,10,24,"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord."
40,10,25,"It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household!"
40,10,26,"Therefore do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known."
40,10,27,"What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops."
40,10,28,"And do not be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."
40,10,29,"Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion coin? Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father's will,"
40,10,30,"but the very hairs of your head are all numbered."
40,10,31,"Therefore do not be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows."
40,10,32,"Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, him I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven."
40,10,33,"But whoever denies me before people, him I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven."
40,10,34,"Do not think that I came to send peace on the earth. I did not come to send peace, but a sword."
40,10,35,"For I came to set a man at odds against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."
40,10,36,"And a man's foes will be those of his own household."
40,10,37,"He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
40,10,38,"And whoever does not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me."
40,10,39,"He who seeks his life will lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it."
40,10,40,"He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me."
40,10,41,"He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward. He who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward."
40,10,42,"And whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink because he is a disciple, truly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward."
40,11,1,"And it happened that when Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and proclaim in their cities."
40,11,2,"Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Messiah, he sent his disciples"
40,11,3,"and said to him, Are you the One who is to come, or should we look for another?"
40,11,4,"And Jesus answered them, Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:"
40,11,5,"the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them."
40,11,6,"And blessed is he who is not offended by me."
40,11,7,"And as these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
40,11,8,"But what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses."
40,11,9,"But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet."
40,11,10,"This is the one of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'"
40,11,11,"Truly I tell you, among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he."
40,11,12,"And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force."
40,11,13,"For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John."
40,11,14,"And if you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come."
40,11,15,"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
40,11,16,"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions"
40,11,17,"and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance. We sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'"
40,11,18,"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'"
40,11,19,"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is justified by her actions."
40,11,20,"Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent."
40,11,21,"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
40,11,22,"But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you."
40,11,23,"And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, you will go down to hell. For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day."
40,11,24,"But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, on the day of judgment, than for you."
40,11,25,"At that time, Jesus answered, I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants."
40,11,26,"Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight."
40,11,27,"All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows the Son, except the Father; neither does anyone know the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son desires to reveal him."
40,11,28,"Come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest."
40,11,29,"Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart; and you will find rest for your souls."
40,11,30,"For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
40,12,1,"At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat."
40,12,2,"But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
40,12,3,"But he said to them, Have not you read what David did, when he was hungry, he and his companions;"
40,12,4,"how he entered into the house of God, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests?"
40,12,5,"Or have you not read in the Law, that on the Sabbath day, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?"
40,12,6,"But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here."
40,12,7,"But if you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless."
40,12,8,"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
40,12,9,"And he departed there, and went into their synagogue."
40,12,10,"And behold there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day? that they might accuse him."
40,12,11,"And he said to them, What man is there among you, who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, won't he grab on to it, and lift it out?"
40,12,12,"Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day."
40,12,13,"Then he told the man, Stretch out your hand. He stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other."
40,12,14,"But the Pharisees went out, and conspired against him, how they might destroy him."
40,12,15,"But Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there. Many followed him; and he healed them all,"
40,12,16,"and commanded them that they should not make him known:"
40,12,17,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,"
40,12,18,"Behold, my servant whom I have chosen;my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased:I will put my Spirit on him.And he will proclaim justice to the nations."
40,12,19,"He will not strive, nor shout;neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets."
40,12,20,"He won't break a bruised reed.And he won't quench a smoking flax,until he leads justice to victory."
40,12,21,"And in his name, the nations will hope."
40,12,22,"Then one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him and he healed him, so that the mute man both spoke and saw."
40,12,23,"And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David?"
40,12,24,"But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons."
40,12,25,"And knowing their thoughts, he said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
40,12,26,"And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?"
40,12,27,"If I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges."
40,12,28,"But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you."
40,12,29,"Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and carry off his possessions, unless he first bind the strong man? And then he will plunder his house."
40,12,30,"He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me, scatters."
40,12,31,"Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven."
40,12,32,"And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come."
40,12,33,"Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit."
40,12,34,"You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks."
40,12,35,"The good man out of his good treasure brings out good things, and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings out evil things."
40,12,36,"But I tell you that every idle word that men speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment."
40,12,37,"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."
40,12,38,"Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees said to him, Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
40,12,39,"But he answered them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet."
40,12,40,"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."
40,12,41,"The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for they repented at the proclaiming of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here."
40,12,42,"The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, someone greater than Solomon is here."
40,12,43,"But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it."
40,12,44,"Then he says, 'I will return into my house from which I came out,' and when he has come back, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order."
40,12,45,"Then he goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even so will it be also to this evil generation."
40,12,46,"While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him."
40,12,47,"Then one said to him, Behold, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you."
40,12,48,"But he answered him who spoke to him, Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?"
40,12,49,"And he stretched out his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
40,12,50,"For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother."
40,13,1,"On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the seaside."
40,13,2,"And great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach."
40,13,3,"And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, a farmer went out to sow."
40,13,4,"And as he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them."
40,13,5,"And others fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth."
40,13,6,"But when the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away."
40,13,7,"Others fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them."
40,13,8,"Still others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty."
40,13,9,"He who has ears, let him hear."
40,13,10,"Then the disciples came, and said to him, Why do you speak to them in parables?"
40,13,11,"And he answered them, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them."
40,13,12,"For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever does not have, from him will be taken away even that which he has."
40,13,13,"Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing, they do not hear, neither do they understand."
40,13,14,"And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says,'By hearing you will hear,and will in no way understand;Seeing you will see,and will in no way perceive:"
40,13,15,"for this people's heart has grown callous,and their ears are dull of hearing,and they have closed their eyes;or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes,hear with their ears,understand with their heart,and should turn again;and I would heal them.'"
40,13,16,"But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear."
40,13,17,"For truly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and did not see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and did not hear them."
40,13,18,"Hear, then, the parable of the farmer."
40,13,19,"When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom, and does not understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside."
40,13,20,"And what was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;"
40,13,21,"yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles."
40,13,22,"And what was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful."
40,13,23,"And what was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who truly bears fruit, and brings forth, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty."
40,13,24,"He set another parable before them, saying, The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,"
40,13,25,"but while people slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away."
40,13,26,"But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the tares appeared also."
40,13,27,"So the servants of the householder came and said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where did these tares come from?'"
40,13,28,"And he said to them, 'An enemy has done this.'The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and gather them up?'"
40,13,29,"But he said, 'No, lest perhaps while you gather up the tares, you root up the wheat with them."
40,13,30,"Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, First, gather up the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.'"
40,13,31,"He set another parable before them, saying, The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field;"
40,13,32,"which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches."
40,13,33,"He spoke another parable to them. The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened."
40,13,34,"Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he did not speak to them,"
40,13,35,"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,I will open my mouth in parables;I will utter things hidden since the beginning of the world. "
40,13,36,"Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares in the field."
40,13,37,"And he answered them, The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,"
40,13,38,"and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the Kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one,"
40,13,39,"and the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels."
40,13,40,"As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of the age."
40,13,41,"The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity,"
40,13,42,"and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth."
40,13,43,"Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear."
40,13,44,"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field."
40,13,45,"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,"
40,13,46,"and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it."
40,13,47,"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,"
40,13,48,"which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away."
40,13,49,"So will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous,"
40,13,50,"and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth."
40,13,51,"Have you understood all these things?They answered him, Yes, Lord."
40,13,52,"And he said to them, Therefore, every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things."
40,13,53,"And it happened that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there."
40,13,54,"And coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works?"
40,13,55,"Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers, Jacob and Joses and Simon and Judas?"
40,13,56,"And are not all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these things?"
40,13,57,"And they were offended by him.But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house."
40,13,58,"And he did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief."
40,14,1,"At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,"
40,14,2,"and said to his servants, This is John the Baptist. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him."
40,14,3,"For Herod had arrested John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife."
40,14,4,"For John said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her."
40,14,5,"And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet."
40,14,6,"But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod."
40,14,7,"Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask."
40,14,8,"And she, being prompted by her mother, said, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
40,14,9,"And the king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,"
40,14,10,"and he sent and beheaded John in the prison."
40,14,11,"And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought it to her mother."
40,14,12,"Then his disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told Jesus."
40,14,13,"Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a secluded place to be alone. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities."
40,14,14,"And he went out, and he saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick."
40,14,15,"Now when evening had come, the disciples came to him, saying, This place is desolate, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food."
40,14,16,"But he said to them, They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
40,14,17,"And they told him, We only have here five loaves and two fish."
40,14,18,"So he said, Bring them here to me."
40,14,19,"Then he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes."
40,14,20,"And they all ate and were filled, and they took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces."
40,14,21,"Now those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children."
40,14,22,"And immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away."
40,14,23,"And after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone."
40,14,24,"But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was against it."
40,14,25,"And in the fourth watch of the night, he came to them, walking on the sea."
40,14,26,"And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It's a ghost! and they screamed with fear."
40,14,27,"But immediately he spoke to them, saying Cheer up! It is I! Do not be afraid."
40,14,28,"Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters."
40,14,29,"He said, Come!Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Jesus."
40,14,30,"But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he yelled, saying, Lord, save me!"
40,14,31,"Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
40,14,32,"When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased."
40,14,33,"Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, You are truly the Son of God!"
40,14,34,"When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret."
40,14,35,"When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were sick,"
40,14,36,"and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole."
40,15,1,"Then the Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,"
40,15,2,"Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread."
40,15,3,"And he answered them, Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?"
40,15,4,"For God said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.'"
40,15,5,"But you say, 'Whoever may tell his father or his mother, Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,"
40,15,6,"he shall not honor his father or mother.' You have made the word of God void because of your tradition."
40,15,7,"You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,"
40,15,8,"'These people honor me with their lips;but their heart is far from me."
40,15,9,"And in vain do they worship me,teaching as doctrine rules made by men.'"
40,15,10,"He summoned the multitude, and said to them, Hear, and understand."
40,15,11,"That which enters into the mouth does not defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man."
40,15,12,"Then the disciples came, and said to him, Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?"
40,15,13,"But he answered, Every plant which my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted."
40,15,14,"Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit."
40,15,15,"Peter answered him, Explain the parable to us."
40,15,16,"So he said, Do you also still not understand?"
40,15,17,"Do you not understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?"
40,15,18,"But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man."
40,15,19,"For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies."
40,15,20,"These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man."
40,15,21,"Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon."
40,15,22,"Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and started shouting, saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely demonized!"
40,15,23,"But he answered her not a word.His disciples came and begged him, saying, Send her away; for she cries after us."
40,15,24,"But he answered, I was not sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
40,15,25,"But she came and worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me."
40,15,26,"But he answered, It is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
40,15,27,"But she said, Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."
40,15,28,"Then Jesus answered her, Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire. And her daughter was healed from that hour."
40,15,29,"Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there."
40,15,30,"Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, crippled, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,"
40,15,31,"so that the crowd wondered when they saw the mute speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and blind seeing-and they glorified the God of Israel."
40,15,32,"Jesus summoned his disciples and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way."
40,15,33,"Then the disciples said to him, Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?"
40,15,34,"Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have?They said, Seven, and a few small fish."
40,15,35,"He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;"
40,15,36,"and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes."
40,15,37,"They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over."
40,15,38,"Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children."
40,15,39,"Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan."
40,16,1,"The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven."
40,16,2,"But he answered them, When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'"
40,16,3,"In the morning, 'It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.' Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times!"
40,16,4,"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of Jonah.He left them, and departed."
40,16,5,"The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread."
40,16,6,"Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
40,16,7,"They reasoned among themselves, saying, We brought no bread."
40,16,8,"Jesus, perceiving it, said, Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, because you have no bread?"
40,16,9,"Do you not yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?"
40,16,10,"Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?"
40,16,11,"How is it that you do not perceive that I did not speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
40,16,12,"Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
40,16,13,"Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?"
40,16,14,"They said, Some say John the Baptist, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
40,16,15,"He said to them, But who do you say that I am?"
40,16,16,"Simon Peter answered, You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
40,16,17,"Jesus answered him, Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
40,16,18,"I also tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it."
40,16,19,"I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven."
40,16,20,"Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he is the Messiah."
40,16,21,"From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up."
40,16,22,"Peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you."
40,16,23,"But he turned, and said to Peter, Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men."
40,16,24,"Then Jesus said to his disciples, If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."
40,16,25,"For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it."
40,16,26,"For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?"
40,16,27,"For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds."
40,16,28,"Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom."
40,17,1,"After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, Jacob, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves."
40,17,2,"He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light."
40,17,3,"Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him."
40,17,4,"Peter answered, and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let us make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
40,17,5,"While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."
40,17,6,"When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid."
40,17,7,"Jesus came and touched them and said, Get up, and do not be afraid."
40,17,8,"Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone."
40,17,9,"As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Do not tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
40,17,10,"The disciples asked him, saying, Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
40,17,11,"He answered them, Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things,"
40,17,12,"but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them."
40,17,13,"Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist."
40,17,14,"When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, saying,"
40,17,15,"Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water."
40,17,16,"So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him."
40,17,17,"Jesus answered, Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me."
40,17,18,"Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour."
40,17,19,"Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, Why weren't we able to cast it out?"
40,17,20,"So he said to them, Because of your little faith. For truly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. ["
40,17,21,"But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.]"
40,17,22,"While they were together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men,"
40,17,23,"and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up.They were exceedingly sorry."
40,17,24,"When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins came to Peter, and said, Does not your teacher pay the didrachma?"
40,17,25,"He said, Yes.When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?"
40,17,26,"He said to him, From strangers.Jesus said to him, Therefore the children are exempt."
40,17,27,"But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin. Take that, and give it to them for me and you."
40,18,1,"In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?"
40,18,2,"He called a little child to himself, and set him in the midst of them,"
40,18,3,"and said, Truly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven."
40,18,4,"Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven."
40,18,5,"Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me,"
40,18,6,"but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be hung around his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea."
40,18,7,"Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks. For there will always be something to cause people to stumble, but woe to the person through whom the stumbling block comes!"
40,18,8,"If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life crippled or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire."
40,18,9,"If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the fire of hell."
40,18,10,"See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. ["
40,18,11,"For the Son of Man came to save what was lost.]"
40,18,12,"What do you think? If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does not he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?"
40,18,13,"If he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray."
40,18,14,"Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish."
40,18,15,"If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother."
40,18,16,"But if he does not listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established."
40,18,17,"If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. If he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector."
40,18,18,"Truly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven."
40,18,19,"Again, truly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven."
40,18,20,"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the midst of them."
40,18,21,"Then Peter came to him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?"
40,18,22,"Jesus said to him, I do not tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven."
40,18,23,"Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants."
40,18,24,"When he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents."
40,18,25,"But because he could not pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made."
40,18,26,"The servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you all!'"
40,18,27,"The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt."
40,18,28,"But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii, and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'"
40,18,29,"So his fellow servant fell down and begged him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you all!'"
40,18,30,"He would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due."
40,18,31,"So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done."
40,18,32,"Then his lord called him in, and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me."
40,18,33,"Should not you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?'"
40,18,34,"His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due."
40,18,35,"So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you do not each forgive your brother from your heart."
40,19,1,"It happened when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan."
40,19,2,"Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there."
40,19,3,"The Pharisees came, testing him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
40,19,4,"He answered, and said, Have not you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,"
40,19,5,"and said, 'For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?'"
40,19,6,"So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, do not let man tear apart."
40,19,7,"They asked him, Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce, and divorce her?"
40,19,8,"He said to them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so."
40,19,9,"I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery."
40,19,10,"The disciples said to him, If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry."
40,19,11,"But he said to them, Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given."
40,19,12,"For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it."
40,19,13,"Then little children were brought to him, that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them."
40,19,14,"But Jesus said, Allow the little children, and do not forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these."
40,19,15,"He placed his hands on them, and departed from there."
40,19,16,"Behold, one came to him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"
40,19,17,"He said to him, Why do you ask me about what is good? No one is good but one. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."
40,19,18,"He said to him, Which ones?Jesus said, 'You shall not murder.' 'You shall not commit adultery.' 'You shall not steal.' 'You shall not offer false testimony.'"
40,19,19,"'Honor your father and mother.' And, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"
40,19,20,"The young man said to him, All these things I have observed. What do I still lack?"
40,19,21,"Jesus said to him, If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
40,19,22,"But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sad, for he was one who had great possessions."
40,19,23,"Jesus said to his disciples, Truly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty."
40,19,24,"Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."
40,19,25,"When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved?"
40,19,26,"Looking at them, Jesus said, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
40,19,27,"Then Peter answered, Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we have?"
40,19,28,"Jesus said to them, Truly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
40,19,29,"Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life."
40,19,30,"But many will be last who are first; and first who are last."
40,20,1,"For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard."
40,20,2,"When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard."
40,20,3,"He went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace."
40,20,4,"To them he said, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.' So they went their way."
40,20,5,"Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise."
40,20,6,"About the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing. He said to them, 'Why do you stand here all day idle?'"
40,20,7,"They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.'He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard.'"
40,20,8,"When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.'"
40,20,9,"When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius."
40,20,10,"When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius."
40,20,11,"When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household,"
40,20,12,"saying, 'These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!'"
40,20,13,"But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?"
40,20,14,"Take that which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you."
40,20,15,"Is not it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?'"
40,20,16,"So the last will be first, and the first last."
40,20,17,"As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the Twelve aside, and on the way he said to them,"
40,20,18,"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death,"
40,20,19,"and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he will be raised up."
40,20,20,"Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him."
40,20,21,"He said to her, What do you want?She said to him, Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom."
40,20,22,"But Jesus answered, You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?They said to him, We are able."
40,20,23,"He said to them, You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
40,20,24,"When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers."
40,20,25,"But Jesus summoned them, and said, You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them."
40,20,26,"It shall not be so among you, but whoever desires to become great among you must be your servant."
40,20,27,"Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant,"
40,20,28,"even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
40,20,29,"As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him."
40,20,30,"Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, shouted, Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!"
40,20,31,"The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they shouted even more, Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!"
40,20,32,"Jesus stood still, and called them, and asked, What do you want me to do for you?"
40,20,33,"They told him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened."
40,20,34,"Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed him."
40,21,1,"When they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,"
40,21,2,"saying to them, Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them, and bring them to me."
40,21,3,"If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them,' and immediately he will send them."
40,21,4,"This took place that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,"
40,21,5,"Tell the daughter of Zion,behold, your King comes to you,humble, and riding on a donkey,on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
40,21,6,"The disciples went, and did just as Jesus directed them,"
40,21,7,"and brought the donkey and the colt, and placed their clothes on them; and he sat on them."
40,21,8,"A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road."
40,21,9,"The multitudes who went before him, and who followed kept shouting, Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the"
40,21,10,"When he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, Who is this?"
40,21,11,"The multitudes said, This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee."
40,21,12,"Jesus entered into the temple, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers' tables and the seats of those who sold the doves."
40,21,13,"He said to them, It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers!"
40,21,14,"The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them."
40,21,15,"But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David! they were indignant,"
40,21,16,"and said to him, Do you hear what these are saying?Jesus said to them, Yes. Did you never read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?'"
40,21,17,"He left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there."
40,21,18,"Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry."
40,21,19,"Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it, Let there be no fruit from you forever!Immediately the fig tree withered away."
40,21,20,"When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away?"
40,21,21,"Jesus answered them, Truly I tell you, if you have faith, and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it would be done."
40,21,22,"All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive."
40,21,23,"When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?"
40,21,24,"Jesus answered them, I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things."
40,21,25,"The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from man?They reasoned with themselves, saying, If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
40,21,26,"But if we say, 'From man,' we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet."
40,21,27,"They answered Jesus, and said, We do not know.He also said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
40,21,28,"But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, 'Son, go work today in the vineyard.'"
40,21,29,"He answered, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind, and went."
40,21,30,"He came to the second, and said the same thing. He answered, 'I go, sir,' but he did not go."
40,21,31,"Which of the two did the will of his father?They said, The first.Jesus said to them, Truly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into the Kingdom of God before you."
40,21,32,"For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw it, you did not even repent afterward, that you might believe him."
40,21,33,"Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went on a journey."
40,21,34,"When the season for the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit."
40,21,35,"The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another."
40,21,36,"Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them the same way."
40,21,37,"But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, 'They will respect my son.'"
40,21,38,"But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and seize his inheritance.'"
40,21,39,"So they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him."
40,21,40,"When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?"
40,21,41,"They told him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the fruit in its season."
40,21,42,"Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the Scriptures,'The stone which the builders rejected,the same was made the head of the corner.This was from the"
40,21,43,"Therefore I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruit."
40,21,44,"He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust."
40,21,45,"When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them."
40,21,46,"When they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered him to be a prophet."
40,22,1,"Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,"
40,22,2,"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,"
40,22,3,"and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not come."
40,22,4,"Again he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have made ready my dinner. My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!'"
40,22,5,"But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,"
40,22,6,"and the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them."
40,22,7,"The king was enraged, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city."
40,22,8,"Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren't worthy."
40,22,9,"Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the marriage feast.'"
40,22,10,"Those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests."
40,22,11,"But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who did not have on wedding clothing,"
40,22,12,"and he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?' He was speechless."
40,22,13,"Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.'"
40,22,14,"For many are called, but few chosen."
40,22,15,"Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk."
40,22,16,"They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach, for you are not partial to anyone."
40,22,17,"Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
40,22,18,"But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why do you test me, you hypocrites?"
40,22,19,"Show me the tax money.They brought to him a denarius."
40,22,20,"He asked them, Whose is this image and inscription?"
40,22,21,"They said to him, Caesar's.Then he said to them, Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
40,22,22,"When they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went away."
40,22,23,"On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him,"
40,22,24,"saying, Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.'"
40,22,25,"Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no seed left his wife to his brother."
40,22,26,"In like manner the second also, and the third, to the seventh."
40,22,27,"After them all, the woman died."
40,22,28,"In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her."
40,22,29,"But Jesus answered them, You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God."
40,22,30,"For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels in heaven."
40,22,31,"But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have not you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,"
40,22,32,"'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?' God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
40,22,33,"When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching."
40,22,34,"But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together."
40,22,35,"One of them, a Law scholar, asked him a question, testing him."
40,22,36,"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
40,22,37,"He said to him, 'You shall love the"
40,22,38,"This is the great and first commandment."
40,22,39,"A second likewise is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"
40,22,40,"The whole Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments."
40,22,41,"Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,"
40,22,42,"saying, What do you think of the Messiah? Whose son is he?They said to him, Of David."
40,22,43,"He said to them, How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,"
40,22,44,"'The"
40,22,45,"If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"
40,22,46,"No one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man dare ask him any more questions from that day forth."
40,23,1,"Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,"
40,23,2,"saying, Upon the seat of Moses the Pharisees and scribes sit."
40,23,3,"All which they will say unto you, observe and do; but their works do not do, because they say, and do not do."
40,23,4,"For they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them."
40,23,5,"But all their works they do to be seen by others. They make their tefillin broad and enlarge the fringe of their garments,"
40,23,6,"and love the place of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,"
40,23,7,"the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called 'Rabbi' by men."
40,23,8,"But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for one is your Teacher, and all of you are brothers."
40,23,9,"Call no man on the earth your father, for one is your Father, he who is in heaven."
40,23,10,"Neither be called masters, for one is your master, the Messiah."
40,23,11,"But he who is greatest among you will be your servant."
40,23,12,"Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."
40,23,13,"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men; for you do not enter in yourselves, neither do you allow those who are entering in to enter. ["
40,23,14,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and as a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.]"
40,23,15,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much of a son of hell as yourselves."
40,23,16,"Woe to you, you blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.'"
40,23,17,"You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?"
40,23,18,"'Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obligated?'"
40,23,19,"You blind men! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?"
40,23,20,"He therefore who swears by the altar, swears by it, and by everything on it."
40,23,21,"He who swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him who was living in it."
40,23,22,"He who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits on it."
40,23,23,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the Law: justice, mercy, and faith. But you ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone."
40,23,24,"You blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!"
40,23,25,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and self-indulgence."
40,23,26,"You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter, that its outside may become clean also."
40,23,27,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitened tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness."
40,23,28,"Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity."
40,23,29,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the tombs of the righteous,"
40,23,30,"and say, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.'"
40,23,31,"Therefore you testify to yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets."
40,23,32,"Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers."
40,23,33,"You serpents, you offspring of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of hell?"
40,23,34,"Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;"
40,23,35,"that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar."
40,23,36,"Truly I tell you, that all these things will come upon this generation."
40,23,37,"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I would have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not!"
40,23,38,"Behold, your house is left to you desolate."
40,23,39,"For I tell you, you will not see me from now on, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the"
40,24,1,"Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way. His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple."
40,24,2,"But he answered them, Do you not see all of these things? Truly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down."
40,24,3,"As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"
40,24,4,"Jesus answered them, Be careful that no one leads you astray."
40,24,5,"For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Messiah,' and will lead many astray."
40,24,6,"You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled, for this must happen, but the end is not yet."
40,24,7,"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places."
40,24,8,"But all these things are the beginning of birth pains."
40,24,9,"Then they will deliver you up to oppression, and will kill you. You will be hated by all of the nations for my name's sake."
40,24,10,"Then many will stumble, and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another."
40,24,11,"Many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray."
40,24,12,"Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold."
40,24,13,"But he who endures to the end, the same will be saved."
40,24,14,"This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come."
40,24,15,"When, therefore, you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),"
40,24,16,"then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains."
40,24,17,"Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house."
40,24,18,"Let him who is in the field not return back to take his coat."
40,24,19,"But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days!"
40,24,20,"Pray that your flight will not be in the winter, nor on a Sabbath,"
40,24,21,"for then there will be great oppression, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be."
40,24,22,"Unless those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved. But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened."
40,24,23,"Then if any man tells you, 'Behold, here is the Messiah,' or, 'There,' do not believe it."
40,24,24,"For there will arise false messiahs, and false prophets, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones."
40,24,25,"Behold, I have told you beforehand."
40,24,26,"If therefore they tell you, 'Behold, he is in the wilderness,' do not go out; 'Behold, he is in the inner chambers,' do not believe it."
40,24,27,"For as the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man."
40,24,28,"For wherever the carcass is, there is where the vultures gather together."
40,24,29,"But immediately after the oppression of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken;"
40,24,30,"and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory."
40,24,31,"He will send out his angels with a great trumpet, and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other."
40,24,32,"Now from the fig tree learn this parable. When its branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near."
40,24,33,"Even so you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors."
40,24,34,"Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away, until all these things are accomplished."
40,24,35,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away."
40,24,36,"But no one knows of that day and hour, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father only."
40,24,37,"As the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man."
40,24,38,"For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship,"
40,24,39,"and they did not know until the flood came, and took them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man."
40,24,40,"Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and one will be left;"
40,24,41,"two women grinding at the mill, one will be taken and one will be left."
40,24,42,"Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes."
40,24,43,"But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into."
40,24,44,"Therefore also be ready, for in an hour that you do not expect, the Son of Man will come."
40,24,45,"Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due season?"
40,24,46,"Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes."
40,24,47,"Truly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has."
40,24,48,"But if that evil servant should say in his heart, 'My lord is delayed,'"
40,24,49,"and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards,"
40,24,50,"the lord of that servant will come in a day when he does not expect it, and in an hour when he does not know it,"
40,24,51,"and will cut him in pieces, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be."
40,25,1,"Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom."
40,25,2,"Five of them were foolish, and five were wise."
40,25,3,"For the foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them,"
40,25,4,"but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps."
40,25,5,"Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept."
40,25,6,"But at midnight there was a cry, 'Behold! The bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'"
40,25,7,"Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps."
40,25,8,"The foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'"
40,25,9,"But the wise answered, saying, 'What if there is not enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.'"
40,25,10,"While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut."
40,25,11,"Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us.'"
40,25,12,"But he answered, 'Truly I tell you, I do not know you.'"
40,25,13,"Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour."
40,25,14,"For it is like a man, going on a journey, who called his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them."
40,25,15,"To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey."
40,25,16,"Immediately the one who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents."
40,25,17,"In like manner he who got the two gained another two."
40,25,18,"But he who received the one went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord's money."
40,25,19,"Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them."
40,25,20,"He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, 'Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents.'"
40,25,21,"His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'"
40,25,22,"He also who got the two talents came and said, 'Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents.'"
40,25,23,"His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'"
40,25,24,"He also who had received the one talent came and said, 'Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter."
40,25,25,"I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.'"
40,25,26,"But his lord answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter."
40,25,27,"You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest."
40,25,28,"Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents."
40,25,29,"For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away."
40,25,30,"Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'"
40,25,31,"But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory."
40,25,32,"Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats."
40,25,33,"He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left."
40,25,34,"Then the King will tell those on his right hand, 'Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;"
40,25,35,"for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you took me in."
40,25,36,"I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me.'"
40,25,37,"Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?"
40,25,38,"When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?"
40,25,39,"When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?'"
40,25,40,"The King will answer them, 'Truly I tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.'"
40,25,41,"Then he will say also to those on the left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels;"
40,25,42,"for I was hungry, and you did not give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;"
40,25,43,"I was a stranger, and you did not take me in; naked, and you did not clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me.'"
40,25,44,"Then they will also answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not help you?'"
40,25,45,"Then he will answer them, saying, 'Truly I tell you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.'"
40,25,46,"These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."
40,26,1,"And it happened, when Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples,"
40,26,2,"You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."
40,26,3,"Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas."
40,26,4,"They took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him."
40,26,5,"But they said, Not during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people."
40,26,6,"Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,"
40,26,7,"a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table."
40,26,8,"But when the disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, Why this waste?"
40,26,9,"For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor."
40,26,10,"However, knowing this, Jesus said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? Because she has done a good work for me."
40,26,11,"For you always have the poor with you; but you do not always have me."
40,26,12,"For in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial."
40,26,13,"Truly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her."
40,26,14,"Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,"
40,26,15,"and said, What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you? They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver."
40,26,16,"From that time he sought opportunity to betray him."
40,26,17,"Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
40,26,18,"He said, Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
40,26,19,"The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover."
40,26,20,"Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples."
40,26,21,"As they were eating, he said, Truly I tell you that one of you will betray me."
40,26,22,"They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, It is not me, is it, Lord?"
40,26,23,"He answered, He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me."
40,26,24,"The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."
40,26,25,"Judas, who betrayed him, answered, It is not me, is it, Rabbi?He said to him, You said it."
40,26,26,"As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body."
40,26,27,"He took a cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, All of you drink it,"
40,26,28,"for this is my blood of the New Covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins."
40,26,29,"But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's Kingdom."
40,26,30,"When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
40,26,31,"Then Jesus said to them, All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
40,26,32,"But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."
40,26,33,"But Peter answered him, Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble."
40,26,34,"Jesus said to him, Truly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
40,26,35,"Peter said to him, Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you. All of the disciples also said likewise."
40,26,36,"Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, Sit here, while I go there and pray."
40,26,37,"He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled."
40,26,38,"Then he said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me."
40,26,39,"He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire."
40,26,40,"He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, What, could not you watch with me for one hour?"
40,26,41,"Watch and pray, that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
40,26,42,"Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done."
40,26,43,"He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy."
40,26,44,"He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words."
40,26,45,"Then he came to the disciples, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
40,26,46,"Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is near."
40,26,47,"While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priest and elders of the people."
40,26,48,"Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him."
40,26,49,"Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi! and kissed him."
40,26,50,"Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him."
40,26,51,"Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear."
40,26,52,"Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword."
40,26,53,"Or do you think that I could not ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?"
40,26,54,"How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?"
40,26,55,"In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me."
40,26,56,"But all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.Then all the disciples left him, and fled."
40,26,57,"Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together."
40,26,58,"But Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end."
40,26,59,"Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death;"
40,26,60,"and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward. But at last two false witnesses came forward,"
40,26,61,"and said, This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.'"
40,26,62,"The high priest stood up, and said to him, Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?"
40,26,63,"But Jesus held his peace. The high priest answered him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Messiah, the Son of God."
40,26,64,"Jesus said to him, You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky."
40,26,65,"Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy."
40,26,66,"What do you think?They answered, He is worthy of death!"
40,26,67,"Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,"
40,26,68,"saying, Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who hit you?"
40,26,69,"Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!"
40,26,70,"But he denied it before them all, saying, I do not know what you are talking about."
40,26,71,"When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth."
40,26,72,"Again he denied it with an oath, I do not know the man."
40,26,73,"After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known."
40,26,74,"Then he began to curse and to swear, I do not know the man!Immediately the rooster crowed."
40,26,75,"Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times. He went out and wept bitterly."
40,27,1,"Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:"
40,27,2,"and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate, the governor."
40,27,3,"Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,"
40,27,4,"saying, I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.But they said, What is that to us? You see to it."
40,27,5,"He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself."
40,27,6,"The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, It's not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood."
40,27,7,"They took counsel, and bought the potter's field with them, to bury strangers in."
40,27,8,"Therefore that field was called The Field of Blood to this day."
40,27,9,"Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,They took the thirty pieces of silver,the price of him upon whom a price had been set,whom some of the sons of Israel priced,"
40,27,10,"and they gave them for the potter's field,as the"
40,27,11,"Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews?Jesus said to him, So you say."
40,27,12,"When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing."
40,27,13,"Then Pilate said to him, Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"
40,27,14,"He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly."
40,27,15,"Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired."
40,27,16,"They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas."
40,27,17,"When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called the Messiah?"
40,27,18,"For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up."
40,27,19,"While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."
40,27,20,"Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus."
40,27,21,"But the governor answered them, Which of the two do you want me to release to you?They said, Barabbas!"
40,27,22,"Pilate said to them, What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called the Messiah?They all said, Let him be crucified!"
40,27,23,"But he said, Why? What evil has he done?But they shouted all the louder, saying, Let him be crucified!"
40,27,24,"So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this man. You see to it."
40,27,25,"All the people answered, May his blood be on us, and on our children!"
40,27,26,"Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified."
40,27,27,"Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him."
40,27,28,"They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him."
40,27,29,"They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!"
40,27,30,"They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head."
40,27,31,"When they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him."
40,27,32,"As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross."
40,27,33,"They came to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull."
40,27,34,"They gave him wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink."
40,27,35,"When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,"
40,27,36,"and they sat and watched him there."
40,27,37,"They set up over his head the accusation against him written, THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
40,27,38,"Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left."
40,27,39,"Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,"
40,27,40,"and saying, You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
40,27,41,"Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, and the elders, said,"
40,27,42,"He saved others, but he cannot save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
40,27,43,"He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
40,27,44,"The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach."
40,27,45,"Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour."
40,27,46,"About the ninth hour Jesus called out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani? That is, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
40,27,47,"Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, This man is calling Elijah."
40,27,48,"Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink."
40,27,49,"The rest said, Let him be. Let us see whether Elijah comes to save him."
40,27,50,"Jesus shouted again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit."
40,27,51,"Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split."
40,27,52,"The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;"
40,27,53,"and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many."
40,27,54,"Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God."
40,27,55,"Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him."
40,27,56,"Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jacob and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee."
40,27,57,"When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus' disciple came."
40,27,58,"This man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up."
40,27,59,"Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,"
40,27,60,"and placed it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed."
40,27,61,"Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb."
40,27,62,"Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,"
40,27,63,"saying, Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: 'After three days I will rise again.'"
40,27,64,"Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He is risen from the dead;' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
40,27,65,"Pilate said to them, You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can."
40,27,66,"So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone."
40,28,1,"Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb."
40,28,2,"Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the"
40,28,3,"His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow."
40,28,4,"For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men."
40,28,5,"The angel answered the women, Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified."
40,28,6,"He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where he was lying."
40,28,7,"Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have told you."
40,28,8,"They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word."
40,28,9,"And behold, Jesus met them, saying, Rejoice!They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him."
40,28,10,"Then Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me."
40,28,11,"Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened."
40,28,12,"When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,"
40,28,13,"saying, Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept."
40,28,14,"If this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry."
40,28,15,"So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jewish people, and continues until this day."
40,28,16,"But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them."
40,28,17,"When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted."
40,28,18,"Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
40,28,19,"Therefore go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,"
40,28,20,"teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
41,1,1,"The beginning of the Good News of Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God."
41,1,2,"As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,Behold, I send my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way before you."
41,1,3,"The voice of one crying in the wilderness,'Make ready the way of the"
41,1,4,"John came baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins."
41,1,5,"All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins."
41,1,6,"John was clothed with camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey."
41,1,7,"He preached, saying, After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen."
41,1,8,"I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit."
41,1,9,"It happened in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan."
41,1,10,"Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove."
41,1,11,"A voice came out of the sky, You are my beloved Son, with you I am well pleased."
41,1,12,"Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness."
41,1,13,"He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him."
41,1,14,"Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the Good News of God,"
41,1,15,"and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is near! Repent, and believe in the Good News."
41,1,16,"And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen."
41,1,17,"Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men."
41,1,18,"Immediately they left the nets, and followed him."
41,1,19,"Going on a little further, he saw Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets."
41,1,20,"Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him."
41,1,21,"They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught."
41,1,22,"They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes."
41,1,23,"Just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he shouted,"
41,1,24,"saying, What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!"
41,1,25,"Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him!"
41,1,26,"The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him."
41,1,27,"They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!"
41,1,28,"The report of him went out immediately into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area."
41,1,29,"Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with Jacob and John."
41,1,30,"Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her."
41,1,31,"And he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them."
41,1,32,"At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by demons."
41,1,33,"All the city was gathered together at the door."
41,1,34,"He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew him."
41,1,35,"Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there."
41,1,36,"Simon and those who were with him followed after him;"
41,1,37,"and they found him, and told him, Everyone is looking for you."
41,1,38,"He said to them, Let us go somewhere else into the next towns, that I may proclaim there also, because I came out for this reason."
41,1,39,"He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons."
41,1,40,"A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If you want to, you can make me clean."
41,1,41,"Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, I want to. Be made clean."
41,1,42,"Immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean."
41,1,43,"He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out,"
41,1,44,"and said to him, See you say nothing to anyone, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
41,1,45,"But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere."
41,2,1,"When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house."
41,2,2,"And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them."
41,2,3,"Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him."
41,2,4,"When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof above him. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on."
41,2,5,"Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Son, your sins are forgiven you."
41,2,6,"But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,"
41,2,7,"Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming; who can forgive sins but God alone?"
41,2,8,"Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, Why do you reason these things in your hearts?"
41,2,9,"Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?'"
41,2,10,"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralytic,"
41,2,11,"I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house."
41,2,12,"And he arose immediately, and took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw anything like this!"
41,2,13,"And he went out again by the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them."
41,2,14,"As he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him."
41,2,15,"It happened, that he was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him."
41,2,16,"The scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, said to his disciples, Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?"
41,2,17,"But when Jesus heard it, he said to them, Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."
41,2,18,"John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
41,2,19,"And Jesus said to them, Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
41,2,20,"But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast in those days."
41,2,21,"No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made."
41,2,22,"And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins."
41,2,23,"It happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain."
41,2,24,"The Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?"
41,2,25,"He said to them, Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry-he, and those who were with him?"
41,2,26,"How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?"
41,2,27,"He said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
41,2,28,"Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."
41,3,1,"He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered."
41,3,2,"They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him."
41,3,3,"He said to the man with the withered hand, Stand up in the middle."
41,3,4,"He said to them, Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill? But they were silent."
41,3,5,"When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, Stretch out your hand. He stretched it out, and his hand was restored."
41,3,6,"The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him."
41,3,7,"Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed from Galilee, from Judea,"
41,3,8,"from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, when they heard what great things he did, came to him."
41,3,9,"And he told his disciples that a small boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they would not press on him."
41,3,10,"For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him."
41,3,11,"The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and shouted, You are the Son of God!"
41,3,12,"And he sternly warned them that they should not make him known."
41,3,13,"And he went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him."
41,3,14,"And he appointed twelve, designating them apostles, and that he might send them out to preach,"
41,3,15,"and to have authority to cast out demons:"
41,3,16,"And he appointed the Twelve: Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;"
41,3,17,"Jacob the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of Jacob, and he surnamed them Boanerges which means, Sons of Thunder;"
41,3,18,"Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; Jacob, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;"
41,3,19,"and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him."
41,3,20,"Then he came into a house. The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread."
41,3,21,"When his family heard it, they went out to take charge of him: for they said, He is out of his mind."
41,3,22,"The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebul, and, By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons."
41,3,23,"So he summoned them, and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?"
41,3,24,"If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
41,3,25,"If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand."
41,3,26,"If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end."
41,3,27,"But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house."
41,3,28,"Truly I tell you, all sins of the sons of men will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;"
41,3,29,"but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal judgment"
41,3,30,"-because they said, He has an unclean spirit."
41,3,31,"Then his brothers and his mother came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him."
41,3,32,"A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, Behold, your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you."
41,3,33,"And he answered them, saying, Who are my mother or my brothers?"
41,3,34,"Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
41,3,35,"For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother."
41,4,1,"Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea."
41,4,2,"Then he taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,"
41,4,3,"Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow,"
41,4,4,"and it happened, as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it."
41,4,5,"Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil."
41,4,6,"But when the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away."
41,4,7,"Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit."
41,4,8,"Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much."
41,4,9,"He said, Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."
41,4,10,"When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables."
41,4,11,"And he said to them, To you has been given the mystery of the Kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,"
41,4,12,"that 'seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should return and be forgiven.'"
41,4,13,"And he said to them, Do you not understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?"
41,4,14,"The farmer sows the word."
41,4,15,"The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them."
41,4,16,"These are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy."
41,4,17,"They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble."
41,4,18,"And others are those who are sown among the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word,"
41,4,19,"but the cares of the age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."
41,4,20,"But those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times."
41,4,21,"And he said to them, Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is not it put on a stand?"
41,4,22,"For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light."
41,4,23,"If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."
41,4,24,"And he said to them, Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you."
41,4,25,"For whoever has, more will be given, and he who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away from him."
41,4,26,"And he said, The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,"
41,4,27,"and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he does not know how."
41,4,28,"For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear."
41,4,29,"But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come."
41,4,30,"And he said, To what will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable will we use for it?"
41,4,31,"It's like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,"
41,4,32,"yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow."
41,4,33,"With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it."
41,4,34,"Without a parable he did not speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything."
41,4,35,"On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, Let us go over to the other side."
41,4,36,"Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other boats were also with him."
41,4,37,"A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled."
41,4,38,"He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, Teacher, do you not care that we are dying?"
41,4,39,"And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace! Be still! The wind ceased, and there was a great calm."
41,4,40,"And he said to them, Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"
41,4,41,"And they were greatly afraid, and said to one another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
41,5,1,"They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes."
41,5,2,"When he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs."
41,5,3,"He lived in the tombs. And no one could bind him any more, not even with chains,"
41,5,4,"because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. No one had the strength to tame him."
41,5,5,"Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones."
41,5,6,"When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,"
41,5,7,"and crying out with a loud voice, he said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me."
41,5,8,"For he said to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"
41,5,9,"Then he asked him, What is your name?He replied, My name is Legion, for we are many."
41,5,10,"And he begged him much that he would not send them away out of the region."
41,5,11,"Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding."
41,5,12,"They begged him, saying, Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them."
41,5,13,"He gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea."
41,5,14,"Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country.The people came out to see what it was that had happened."
41,5,15,"They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid."
41,5,16,"And those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs."
41,5,17,"Then they began to beg him to depart from their region."
41,5,18,"As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him."
41,5,19,"And he did not allow him, but said to him, Go to your house, to your own, and tell them what great things the"
41,5,20,"So he went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled."
41,5,21,"And when Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea."
41,5,22,"One of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,"
41,5,23,"and begged him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live."
41,5,24,"And he went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides."
41,5,25,"Now a woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,"
41,5,26,"and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,"
41,5,27,"having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes."
41,5,28,"For she said, If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well."
41,5,29,"And immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction."
41,5,30,"And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, Who touched my clothes?"
41,5,31,"And his disciples said to him, You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'"
41,5,32,"He looked around to see her who had done this thing."
41,5,33,"But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth."
41,5,34,"And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease."
41,5,35,"While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler's house saying, Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?"
41,5,36,"But Jesus, overhearing the message spoken, said to the ruler of the synagogue, Do not be afraid, only believe."
41,5,37,"He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, Jacob, and John the brother of Jacob."
41,5,38,"And they came to the synagogue ruler's house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing."
41,5,39,"When he had entered in, he said to them, Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep."
41,5,40,"And they ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was."
41,5,41,"Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, Talitha koum! which means, being interpreted, Girl, I tell you, get up!"
41,5,42,"And immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement."
41,5,43,"And he strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat."
41,6,1,"And he went out from there and came into his own country, and his disciples followed him."
41,6,2,"When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, Where did this man get these things? and, What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?"
41,6,3,"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of Jacob, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Are not his sisters here with us? They were offended at him."
41,6,4,"Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house."
41,6,5,"And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed them."
41,6,6,"And He marveled because of their unbelief.And he went around the villages teaching."
41,6,7,"And he called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits."
41,6,8,"And he commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse,"
41,6,9,"but to wear sandals, and not to put on two tunics."
41,6,10,"And he said to them, Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there."
41,6,11,"Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them."
41,6,12,"So they went out and proclaimed that all should repent."
41,6,13,"They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them."
41,6,14,"King Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him."
41,6,15,"But others said, He is Elijah. Others said, He is a prophet, like one of the prophets."
41,6,16,"But Herod, when he heard this, said, This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen."
41,6,17,"For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, for he had married her."
41,6,18,"For John said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
41,6,19,"So Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she could not,"
41,6,20,"for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was very perplexed, but he heard him gladly."
41,6,21,"And then a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday gave a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee."
41,6,22,"And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you."
41,6,23,"And he swore to her, Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."
41,6,24,"So she went out, and said to her mother, What shall I ask?And she said, The head of John the Baptist."
41,6,25,"And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
41,6,26,"And the king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he did not wish to refuse her."
41,6,27,"So immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John's head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison,"
41,6,28,"and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother."
41,6,29,"And when his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and placed it in a tomb."
41,6,30,"Then the apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught."
41,6,31,"And he said to them, Come away by yourselves to an isolated place, and rest awhile. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat."
41,6,32,"So they went away in the boat to an isolated place by themselves."
41,6,33,"But they saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities and they arrived before them."
41,6,34,"And he came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things."
41,6,35,"And when it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, This place is desolate, and it is late in the day."
41,6,36,"Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves something to eat."
41,6,37,"But he answered them, You give them something to eat.They asked him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?"
41,6,38,"He said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go see.When they knew, they said, Five, and two fish."
41,6,39,"He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass."
41,6,40,"They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties."
41,6,41,"He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all."
41,6,42,"They all ate, and were filled."
41,6,43,"They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish."
41,6,44,"Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men."
41,6,45,"And immediately he made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away."
41,6,46,"After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray."
41,6,47,"When evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land."
41,6,48,"He saw them distressed in rowing, for the wind was against them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he would have passed by them,"
41,6,49,"but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and began to scream;"
41,6,50,"for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, Cheer up! It is I! Do not be afraid."
41,6,51,"He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves;"
41,6,52,"for they had not understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened."
41,6,53,"When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore."
41,6,54,"When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,"
41,6,55,"and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was."
41,6,56,"Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they placed the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well."
41,7,1,"Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem."
41,7,2,"Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault."
41,7,3,"(For the Pharisees, and all the Judeans, do not eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders."
41,7,4,"They do not eat when they come from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, and bronze vessels.)"
41,7,5,"The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?"
41,7,6,"He said to them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,'This people honors me with their lips,but their heart is far from me."
41,7,7,"But in vain do they worship me,teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'"
41,7,8,"For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men."
41,7,9,"He said to them, Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition."
41,7,10,"For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother;' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.'"
41,7,11,"But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother, Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban, that is to say, given to God;'"
41,7,12,"then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,"
41,7,13,"making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this."
41,7,14,"He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, Hear me, all of you, and understand."
41,7,15,"There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man. ["
41,7,16,"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!]"
41,7,17,"When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable."
41,7,18,"He said to them, Are you thus without understanding also? Do you not perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile him,"
41,7,19,"because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, cleansing all the foods?"
41,7,20,"He said, That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man."
41,7,21,"For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,"
41,7,22,"covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness."
41,7,23,"All these evil things come from within, and defile the man."
41,7,24,"From there he arose, and went away into the region of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and did not want anyone to know it, but he could not escape notice."
41,7,25,"For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, immediately came and fell down at his feet."
41,7,26,"Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter."
41,7,27,"But he said to her, Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
41,7,28,"But she answered him, Yes, Sir. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."
41,7,29,"He said to her, For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter."
41,7,30,"And when she went away to her house, she found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone out."
41,7,31,"Again he departed from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the region of Decapolis."
41,7,32,"They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him."
41,7,33,"He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue."
41,7,34,"Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha! that is, Be opened!"
41,7,35,"Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly."
41,7,36,"He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it."
41,7,37,"They were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!"
41,8,1,"In those days, when there was a great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, he called his disciples to himself, and said to them,"
41,8,2,"I have compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three days, and have nothing to eat."
41,8,3,"If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, and some of them have come a long way."
41,8,4,"His disciples answered him, From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?"
41,8,5,"He asked them, How many loaves do you have?They said, Seven."
41,8,6,"He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude."
41,8,7,"They had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also."
41,8,8,"They ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over."
41,8,9,"Now they were about four thousand. Then he sent them away."
41,8,10,"Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha."
41,8,11,"The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing him."
41,8,12,"He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation."
41,8,13,"He left them, and again entering into a boat, departed to the other side."
41,8,14,"Now they forgot to take bread; and they did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them."
41,8,15,"He warned them, saying, Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod."
41,8,16,"They reasoned with one another, saying, It's because we have no bread."
41,8,17,"He, perceiving it, said to them, Why do you reason that it's because you have no bread? Do you not perceive yet, neither understand? Are your hearts hardened?"
41,8,18,"Having eyes, do you not see? Having ears, do you not hear? Do you not remember?"
41,8,19,"When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?They told him, Twelve."
41,8,20,"When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?They told him, Seven."
41,8,21,"He asked them, Do you not yet understand?"
41,8,22,"He came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him."
41,8,23,"He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything."
41,8,24,"He looked up, and said, I see men; they look like trees walking."
41,8,25,"Then again he laid his hands on his eyes. He made him look up, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly."
41,8,26,"He sent him away to his house, saying, Do not enter into the village."
41,8,27,"Jesus went out, with his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, Who do men say that I am?"
41,8,28,"They answered him, John the Baptist, and others say Elijah, but others: one of the prophets."
41,8,29,"He said to them, But who do you say that I am?Peter answered, You are the Messiah."
41,8,30,"He commanded them that they should tell no one about him."
41,8,31,"He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again."
41,8,32,"He spoke to them openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him."
41,8,33,"But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men."
41,8,34,"He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them, If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."
41,8,35,"For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it."
41,8,36,"For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?"
41,8,37,"Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?"
41,8,38,"For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
41,9,1,"He said to them, Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with power."
41,9,2,"After six days Jesus took with him Peter, Jacob, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front of them."
41,9,3,"His clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them."
41,9,4,"Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus."
41,9,5,"Peter said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
41,9,6,"For he did not know what to say, for they became very afraid."
41,9,7,"A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son. Listen to him."
41,9,8,"Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only."
41,9,9,"As they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead."
41,9,10,"They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the rising from the dead meant."
41,9,11,"They asked him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
41,9,12,"He told them, Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised?"
41,9,13,"But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him."
41,9,14,"Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them."
41,9,15,"Immediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him greeted him."
41,9,16,"He asked them, What are you asking them?"
41,9,17,"One of the multitude answered him, and said, Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;"
41,9,18,"and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren't able."
41,9,19,"He answered him, Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me."
41,9,20,"They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth."
41,9,21,"He asked his father, How long has it been since this has come to him?He said, From childhood."
41,9,22,"Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us."
41,9,23,"Jesus said to him, 'If you can?' All things are possible to him who believes."
41,9,24,"Immediately the father of the child exclaimed, I believe. Help my unbelief!"
41,9,25,"When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, You deaf and mute spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!"
41,9,26,"Having screamed, and convulsed greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead; so much that most of them said, He is dead."
41,9,27,"But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose."
41,9,28,"And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast it out?"
41,9,29,"And he said to them, This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer [and fasting]. "
41,9,30,"They went out from there, and passed through Galilee. He did not want anyone to know it."
41,9,31,"For he was teaching his disciples, and said to them, The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he will rise again."
41,9,32,"But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him."
41,9,33,"He came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them, What were you arguing on the way?"
41,9,34,"But they were silent, for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the greatest."
41,9,35,"He sat down, and called the twelve; and he said to them, If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all."
41,9,36,"He took a little child, and set him in the midst of them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,"
41,9,37,"Whoever receives one such little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me, does not receive me, but him who sent me."
41,9,38,"John said to him, Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow us."
41,9,39,"But Jesus said, Do not forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me."
41,9,40,"For whoever is not against us is for us."
41,9,41,"For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you belong to the Messiah, truly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward."
41,9,42,"Whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if he was thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck."
41,9,43,"If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire, ["
41,9,44,"where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.]"
41,9,45,"If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into hell. ["
41,9,46,"where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.]"
41,9,47,"If your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell,"
41,9,48,"'where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.'"
41,9,49,"For everyone will be salted with fire."
41,9,50,"Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."
41,10,1,"He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Multitudes came together to him again. As he usually did, he was again teaching them."
41,10,2,"Pharisees came to him testing him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"
41,10,3,"He answered, What did Moses command you?"
41,10,4,"They said, Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her."
41,10,5,"But Jesus said, For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment."
41,10,6,"But from the beginning of the creation, he made them male and female."
41,10,7,"For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife,"
41,10,8,"and the two will become one flesh, so that they are no longer two, but one flesh."
41,10,9,"What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate."
41,10,10,"In the house, the disciples asked him again about the same matter."
41,10,11,"He said to them, Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her."
41,10,12,"If she herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits adultery."
41,10,13,"They were bringing to him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked them."
41,10,14,"But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said to them, Allow the little children to come to me! Do not forbid them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
41,10,15,"Truly I tell you, whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it."
41,10,16,"And he took them in his arms, laying his hands on them, and blessed them."
41,10,17,"As he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
41,10,18,"Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? No one is good except one-God."
41,10,19,"You know the commandments: 'Do not murder,' 'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not steal,' 'Do not give false testimony,' 'Do not defraud,' 'Honor your father and mother.'"
41,10,20,"And he said to him, Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth."
41,10,21,"Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross."
41,10,22,"But his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions."
41,10,23,"Jesus looked around, and said to his disciples, How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!"
41,10,24,"The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answered again, Children, how hard is it to enter into the Kingdom of God!"
41,10,25,"It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."
41,10,26,"They were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, Then who can be saved?"
41,10,27,"Jesus, looking at them, said, With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God."
41,10,28,"Peter began to tell him, Behold, we have left everything, and have followed you."
41,10,29,"Jesus said, Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News,"
41,10,30,"but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life."
41,10,31,"But many who are first will be last; and the last first."
41,10,32,"They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him."
41,10,33,"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles."
41,10,34,"They will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him. After three days he will rise again."
41,10,35,"Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, came near to him, and said to him, Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we will ask."
41,10,36,"He said to them, What do you want me to do for you?"
41,10,37,"They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your glory."
41,10,38,"But Jesus said to them, You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"
41,10,39,"They said to him, We are able.Jesus said to them, You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;"
41,10,40,"but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared."
41,10,41,"When the ten heard it, they began to be indignant towards Jacob and John."
41,10,42,"Jesus summoned them, and said to them, You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them."
41,10,43,"But it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant."
41,10,44,"Whoever of you wants to become first among you, shall be bondservant of all."
41,10,45,"For the Son of Man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
41,10,46,"They came to Jericho. As he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road."
41,10,47,"When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!"
41,10,48,"Many rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he shouted all the louder, You son of David, have mercy on me!"
41,10,49,"Jesus stood still, and said, Call him.They called the blind man, saying to him, Cheer up! Get up. He is calling you!"
41,10,50,"He, casting away his cloak, jumped up, and came to Jesus."
41,10,51,"Jesus asked him, What do you want me to do for you?The blind man said to him, Rabboni, that I may see again."
41,10,52,"Jesus said to him, Go your way. Your faith has made you well. And immediately he received his sight, and followed himon the road."
41,11,1,"When they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,"
41,11,2,"and said to them, Go your way into the village that is opposite you. Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on which no one has yet sat. Untie him, and bring him."
41,11,3,"If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs him;' and immediately he will send him back here."
41,11,4,"They went away, and found a colt tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied him."
41,11,5,"Some of those who stood there asked them, What are you doing, untying the young donkey?"
41,11,6,"They said to them just as Jesus had said, and they let them go."
41,11,7,"They brought the young donkey to Jesus, and threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it."
41,11,8,"Many spread their garments on the way, and others cut down branches from the trees."
41,11,9,"Those who went in front, and those who followed, shouted, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the"
41,11,10,"Blessed is the kingdom of our father David. Hosanna in the highest!"
41,11,11,"And he entered into the temple in Jerusalem. When he had looked around at everything, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve."
41,11,12,"The next day, when they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry."
41,11,13,"Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs."
41,11,14,"Jesus told it, May no one ever eat fruit from you again! and his disciples heard it."
41,11,15,"They came to Jerusalem, and he entered into the temple, and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves."
41,11,16,"He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple."
41,11,17,"He taught, saying to them, Is not it written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations?' But you have made it a den of robbers!"
41,11,18,"The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching."
41,11,19,"When evening came, he went out of the city."
41,11,20,"As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots."
41,11,21,"Peter, remembering, said to him, Teacher, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away."
41,11,22,"Jesus answered them, Have faith in God."
41,11,23,"Truly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening; it will be done for him."
41,11,24,"Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you shall have them."
41,11,25,"Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions."
41,11,27,"They came again to Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders came to him,"
41,11,28,"and they began saying to him, By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority to do these things?"
41,11,29,"Jesus said to them, I will also ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
41,11,30,"The baptism of John-was it from heaven, or from man? Answer me."
41,11,31,"They reasoned with themselves, saying, If we should say, 'From heaven;' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
41,11,32,"If we should say, 'From man'-they feared the crowd, for all held John to really be a prophet."
41,11,33,"They answered and said to Jesus, We do not know.Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things."
41,12,1,"He began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the winepress, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went on a journey."
41,12,2,"When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard."
41,12,3,"They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty."
41,12,4,"Again, he sent another servant to them; and they wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated."
41,12,5,"And he sent another; and they killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some."
41,12,6,"He had one left, a beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'"
41,12,7,"But those farmers said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'"
41,12,8,"They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard."
41,12,9,"What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others."
41,12,10,"Haven't you even read this Scripture:'The stone which the builders rejected,the same was made the head of the corner."
41,12,11,"This was from the"
41,12,12,"They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him, and went away."
41,12,13,"They sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words."
41,12,14,"When they had come, they asked him, Teacher, we know that you are honest, and do not defer to anyone; for you are not partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
41,12,15,"Shall we give, or shall we not give?But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it."
41,12,16,"They brought it.He said to them, Whose is this image and inscription?They said to him, Caesar's."
41,12,17,"And Jesus said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.They marveled greatly at him."
41,12,18,"There came to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying,"
41,12,19,"Teacher, Moses wrote to us, 'If a man's brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take the wife, and raise up offspring for his brother.'"
41,12,20,"There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring."
41,12,21,"The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise;"
41,12,22,"and the seven left no children. Last of all the woman also died."
41,12,23,"In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife."
41,12,24,"Jesus said to them, Is not this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God?"
41,12,25,"For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven."
41,12,26,"But about the dead, that they are raised; have not you read in the book of Moses, about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?"
41,12,27,"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken."
41,12,28,"And one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together. Knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, Which commandment is the greatest of all?"
41,12,29,"Jesus answered, The first is, 'Hear, Israel, the"
41,12,30,"you shall love the"
41,12,31,"The second is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."
41,12,32,"The scribe said to him, Truly, Teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he,"
41,12,33,"and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
41,12,34,"When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, You are not far from the Kingdom of God.No one dared ask him any question after that."
41,12,35,"Jesus responded, as he taught in the temple, How is it that the scribes say that the Messiah is the son of David?"
41,12,36,"David himself said in the Holy Spirit,'The"
41,12,37,"David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?The common people heard him gladly."
41,12,38,"In his teaching he said to them, Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces,"
41,12,39,"and the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts:"
41,12,40,"those who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation."
41,12,41,"And he sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much."
41,12,42,"A poor widow came, and she cast in two small brass coins, which equal a quadrans coin."
41,12,43,"He called his disciples to himself, and said to them, Truly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,"
41,12,44,"for they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on."
41,13,1,"As he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings!"
41,13,2,"And Jesus said to him, Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down."
41,13,3,"As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, Jacob, John, and Andrew asked him privately,"
41,13,4,"Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?"
41,13,5,"And Jesus began to say to them, Be careful that no one leads you astray."
41,13,6,"Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and will lead many astray."
41,13,7,"When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled. Such things must happen, but the end is not yet."
41,13,8,"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines. These things are the beginning of birth pains."
41,13,9,"But watch yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them."
41,13,10,"The Good News must first be preached to all the nations."
41,13,11,"When they lead you away and deliver you up, do not be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit."
41,13,12,"Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death."
41,13,13,"You will be hated by all men for my name's sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved."
41,13,14,"But when you see the abomination of desolation, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,"
41,13,15,"and let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house."
41,13,16,"Let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak."
41,13,17,"But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days!"
41,13,18,"And pray that it won't be in the winter."
41,13,19,"For in those days there will be oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be."
41,13,20,"Unless the"
41,13,21,"Then if anyone tells you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'Look, there!' do not believe it."
41,13,22,"For there will arise false messiahs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, the chosen ones."
41,13,23,"But you watch.I have told you all things beforehand."
41,13,24,"But in those days, after that oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light,"
41,13,25,"the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken."
41,13,26,"Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory."
41,13,27,"Then he will send out his angels, and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky."
41,13,28,"Now from the fig tree, learn this parable. When the branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near;"
41,13,29,"even so you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors."
41,13,30,"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen."
41,13,31,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away."
41,13,32,"But of that day or the hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."
41,13,33,"Watch, keep alert; for you do not know when the time is."
41,13,34,"It is like a man, traveling to another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, and to each one his work, and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch."
41,13,35,"Watch therefore, for you do not know when the lord of the house is coming -- at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning;"
41,13,36,"lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping."
41,13,37,"What I tell you, I tell all: Watch."
41,14,1,"It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and kill him."
41,14,2,"For they said, Not during the feast, because there might be a riot of the people."
41,14,3,"While he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard-very costly. She broke the jar, and poured it over his head."
41,14,4,"But there were some who were indignant among themselves, Why has this ointment been wasted?"
41,14,5,"For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor. They grumbled against her."
41,14,6,"But Jesus said, Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me."
41,14,7,"For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me."
41,14,8,"She has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying."
41,14,9,"Truly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her."
41,14,10,"Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them."
41,14,11,"They, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently deliver him."
41,14,12,"On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, Where do you want us to go and make ready that you may eat the Passover?"
41,14,13,"He sent two of his disciples, and said to them, Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,"
41,14,14,"and wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'"
41,14,15,"He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Make ready for us there."
41,14,16,"The disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover."
41,14,17,"When it was evening he came with the twelve."
41,14,18,"As they sat and were eating, Jesus said, Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me-he who eats with me."
41,14,19,"They began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, Surely not I?"
41,14,20,"He said to them, It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish."
41,14,21,"For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."
41,14,22,"As they were eating, he took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, Take; this is my body."
41,14,23,"He took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it."
41,14,24,"He said to them, This is my blood of the New Covenant, which is poured out for many."
41,14,25,"Truly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God."
41,14,26,"When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
41,14,27,"Jesus said to them, All of you will fall away, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"
41,14,28,"However, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."
41,14,29,"But Peter said to him, Although all will be offended, yet I will not."
41,14,30,"Jesus said to him, Truly I tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
41,14,31,"But he insisted, If I must die with you, I will not deny you. They all said the same thing."
41,14,32,"They came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, Sit here, while I pray."
41,14,33,"He took with him Peter, Jacob, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed."
41,14,34,"He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch."
41,14,35,"He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him."
41,14,36,"He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire."
41,14,37,"He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? Could not you watch one hour?"
41,14,38,"Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
41,14,39,"Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words."
41,14,40,"Again he came and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know what to answer him."
41,14,41,"He came the third time, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
41,14,42,"Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is near."
41,14,43,"Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came-and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders."
41,14,44,"Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely."
41,14,45,"When he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, Rabbi! and kissed him."
41,14,46,"They laid hands on him, and seized him."
41,14,47,"But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear."
41,14,48,"Jesus answered them, Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?"
41,14,49,"I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled."
41,14,50,"They all left him, and fled."
41,14,51,"And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over his naked body. And they grabbed him,"
41,14,52,"but he left the linen cloth, and fled naked."
41,14,53,"They led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together."
41,14,54,"Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire."
41,14,55,"Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none."
41,14,56,"For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony did not agree with each other."
41,14,57,"Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,"
41,14,58,"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.'"
41,14,59,"Even so, their testimony did not agree."
41,14,60,"The high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?"
41,14,61,"But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?"
41,14,62,"Jesus said, I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky."
41,14,63,"The high priest tore his clothes, and said, What further need have we of witnesses?"
41,14,64,"You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think? They all condemned him to be worthy of death."
41,14,65,"Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, Prophesy! The officers struck him with the palms of their hands."
41,14,66,"As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,"
41,14,67,"and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!"
41,14,68,"But he denied it, saying, I neither know, nor understand what you are saying. He went out on the porch, and a rooster crowed."
41,14,69,"The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, This is one of them."
41,14,70,"But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean."
41,14,71,"But he began to curse, and to swear, I do not know this man of whom you speak!"
41,14,72,"And immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times. When he thought about that, he wept."
41,15,1,"Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate."
41,15,2,"Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews?He answered, So you say."
41,15,3,"The chief priests accused him of many things."
41,15,4,"Pilate again asked him, Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!"
41,15,5,"But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled."
41,15,6,"Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they requested."
41,15,7,"There was one called Barabbas, bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder."
41,15,8,"And the multitude went up and began to ask him to do as he always did for them."
41,15,9,"Pilate answered them, saying, Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"
41,15,10,"For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up."
41,15,11,"But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead."
41,15,12,"Pilate again asked them, What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?"
41,15,13,"They shouted again, Crucify him!"
41,15,14,"Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done?But they shouted all the louder, Crucify him!"
41,15,15,"Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified."
41,15,16,"The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort."
41,15,17,"They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him."
41,15,18,"They began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!"
41,15,19,"They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him."
41,15,20,"When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him."
41,15,21,"They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross."
41,15,22,"They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull."
41,15,23,"They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he did not take it."
41,15,24,"Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take."
41,15,25,"It was the third hour, and they crucified him."
41,15,26,"The superscription of his accusation was written over him, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
41,15,27,"With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left. [The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, He was numbered with transgressors.]"
41,15,29,"Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,"
41,15,30,"save yourself, and come down from the cross!"
41,15,31,"Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others. He cannot save himself."
41,15,32,"Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him. Those who were crucified with him insulted him."
41,15,33,"When the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."
41,15,34,"At the ninth hour Jesus called out with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
41,15,35,"Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he is calling Elijah."
41,15,36,"One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, Let him be. Let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down."
41,15,37,"Jesus gave a loud cry, and gave up the spirit."
41,15,38,"The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom."
41,15,39,"When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he died like this and breathed his last, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God!"
41,15,40,"There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Jacob the younger and of Joses, and Salome;"
41,15,41,"who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem."
41,15,42,"When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,"
41,15,43,"Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for the Kingdom of God, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus."
41,15,44,"Pilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long."
41,15,45,"When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph."
41,15,46,"He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and placed him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb."
41,15,47,"Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was placed."
41,16,1,"When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Jacob, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him."
41,16,2,"Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen."
41,16,3,"They were saying among themselves, Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?"
41,16,4,"for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back."
41,16,5,"Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed."
41,16,6,"He said to them, Do not be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they put him!"
41,16,7,"But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.'"
41,16,8,"They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid."
41,16,9,"Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons."
41,16,10,"She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept."
41,16,11,"When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved."
41,16,12,"After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country."
41,16,13,"They went away and told it to the rest. They did not believe them, either."
41,16,14,"Afterward he was revealed to the Eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen."
41,16,15,"He said to them, Go into all the world, and proclaim the Good News to the whole creation."
41,16,16,"He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned."
41,16,17,"These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;"
41,16,18,"they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover."
41,16,19,"So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God."
41,16,20,"They went out, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed."
42,1,1,"Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,"
42,1,2,"even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us,"
42,1,3,"it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus;"
42,1,4,"that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed."
42,1,5,"There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zechariah, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth."
42,1,6,"They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the"
42,1,7,"But they had no child, because Elisabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years."
42,1,8,"Now it happened, while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his division,"
42,1,9,"according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the"
42,1,10,"The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense."
42,1,11,"An angel of the"
42,1,12,"Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him."
42,1,13,"But the angel said to him, Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elisabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John."
42,1,14,"You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth."
42,1,15,"For he will be great in the sight of the"

42,1,17,"He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the"
42,1,18,"Zechariah said to the angel, How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years."
42,1,19,"The angel answered him, I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news."
42,1,20,"Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."
42,1,21,"The people were waiting for Zechariah, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple."
42,1,22,"When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute."
42,1,23,"It happened, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house."
42,1,24,"After these days Elisabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,"
42,1,25,"Thus has the"
42,1,26,"Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,"
42,1,27,"to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary."
42,1,28,"Having come in, the angel said to her, Rejoice, you highly favored one! The"
42,1,29,"But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be."
42,1,30,"The angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God."
42,1,31,"Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name 'Jesus.'"
42,1,32,"He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. The"
42,1,33,"and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom."
42,1,34,"Mary said to the angel, How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?"
42,1,35,"The angel answered her, The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born will be called the Son of God."
42,1,36,"Behold, Elisabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren."
42,1,37,"For everything spoken by God is possible."
42,1,38,"Mary said, Behold, the handmaid of the"
42,1,39,"Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,"
42,1,40,"and entered into the house of Zechariah and greeted Elisabeth."
42,1,41,"It happened, when Elisabeth heard Mary's greeting, that the baby leaped in her womb, and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit."
42,1,42,"She called out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!"
42,1,43,"Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"
42,1,44,"For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!"
42,1,45,"Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the"
42,1,46,"Mary said,My soul magnifies the"
42,1,47,"My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,"
42,1,48,"for he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid.For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed."
42,1,49,"For he who is mighty has done great things for me.Holy is his name."
42,1,50,"His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear him."
42,1,51,"He has shown strength with his arm.He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts."
42,1,52,"He has put down princes from their thrones.And has exalted the lowly."
42,1,53,"He has filled the hungry with good things.He has sent the rich away empty."
42,1,54,"He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,"
42,1,55,"As he spoke to our fathers,to Abraham and his seed forever."
42,1,56,"Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her house."
42,1,57,"Now the time that Elisabeth should give birth was fulfilled, and she brought forth a son."
42,1,58,"Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the"
42,1,59,"It happened on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zechariah, after the name of the father."
42,1,60,"His mother answered, Not so; but he will be called John."
42,1,61,"They said to her, There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name."
42,1,62,"They made signs to his father, what he would have him called."
42,1,63,"He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, His name is John.They all marveled."
42,1,64,"His mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God."
42,1,65,"Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea."
42,1,66,"All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then will this child be? The hand of the"
42,1,67,"His father, Zechariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,"
42,1,68,"Blessed be the"
42,1,69,"and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David"
42,1,70,"(as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old),"
42,1,71,"salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;"
42,1,72,"to show mercy towards our fathers,to remember his holy covenant,"
42,1,73,"the oath which he spoke to Abraham, our father,"
42,1,74,"to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies,should serve him without fear,"
42,1,75,"In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life."
42,1,76,"And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High,for you will go before the Lord to make ready his ways,"
42,1,77,"to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,"
42,1,78,"because of the tender mercy of our God,whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,"
42,1,79,"to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death;to guide our feet into the way of peace."
42,1,80,"The child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel."
42,2,1,"Now it happened in those days, that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled."
42,2,2,"This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria."
42,2,3,"All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city."
42,2,4,"Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;"
42,2,5,"to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him, being pregnant."
42,2,6,"It happened, while they were there, that the day had come that she should give birth."
42,2,7,"She brought forth her firstborn son, and she wrapped him in bands of cloth, and placed him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn."
42,2,8,"There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock."
42,2,9,"Behold, an angel of the"
42,2,10,"The angel said to them, Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people."
42,2,11,"For there is born to you, this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Messiah, the Lord."
42,2,12,"This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough."
42,2,13,"Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,"
42,2,14,"Glory to God in the highest,on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased."
42,2,15,"It happened, when the angels went away from them into the sky, that the men, the shepherds, said one to another, Let us go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the"
42,2,16,"They came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough."
42,2,17,"When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child."
42,2,18,"All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds."
42,2,19,"But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart."
42,2,20,"The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them."
42,2,21,"When eight days were fulfilled to circumcise him, his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb."
42,2,22,"When the days of their purification according to the Law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the"
42,2,23,"(as it is written in the Law of the"
42,2,24,"and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the Law of the"
42,2,25,"Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him."
42,2,26,"It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the"
42,2,27,"He came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the requirement of the Law,"
42,2,28,"then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,"
42,2,29,"Now you are releasing your servant, Master,according to your word, in peace;"
42,2,30,"for my eyes have seen your salvation,"
42,2,31,"which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;"
42,2,32,"a light for revelation to the nations,and the glory of your people Israel."
42,2,33,"And his father and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him,"
42,2,34,"and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against."
42,2,35,"Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."
42,2,36,"There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,"
42,2,37,"and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who did not depart from the temple, worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day."
42,2,38,"Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem."
42,2,39,"When they had accomplished all things that were according to the Law of the"
42,2,40,"The child was growing, and was becoming strong, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him."
42,2,41,"His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover."
42,2,42,"When he was twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the feast,"
42,2,43,"and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it,"
42,2,44,"but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances."
42,2,45,"When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him."
42,2,46,"It happened after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions."
42,2,47,"All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers."
42,2,48,"When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you."
42,2,49,"He said to them, Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?"
42,2,50,"They did not understand the saying which he spoke to them."
42,2,51,"And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart."
42,2,52,"And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man."
42,3,1,"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,"
42,3,2,"in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness."
42,3,3,"He came into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming the baptism of repentance for remission of sins."
42,3,4,"As it is written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah the prophet,The voice of one crying in the wilderness,'Make ready the way of the"
42,3,5,"Every valley will be filled.Every mountain and hill will be brought low.The crooked will become straight,and the rough ways smooth."
42,3,6,"All flesh will see God's salvation.'"
42,3,7,"He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
42,3,8,"Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father;' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones!"
42,3,9,"Even now the axe also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire."
42,3,10,"The multitudes asked him, What then must we do?"
42,3,11,"He answered them, He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise."
42,3,12,"Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, Teacher, what must we do?"
42,3,13,"He said to them, Collect no more than that which is appointed to you."
42,3,14,"Soldiers also asked him, saying, What about us? What must we do?He said to them, Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages."
42,3,15,"As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Messiah,"
42,3,16,"John answered them all, I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,"
42,3,17,"whose fan is in his hand, to thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
42,3,18,"Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people,"
42,3,19,"but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,"
42,3,20,"added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison."
42,3,21,"Now it happened, when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The sky was opened,"
42,3,22,"and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased."
42,3,23,"Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Eli,"
42,3,24,"the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,"
42,3,25,"the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,"
42,3,26,"the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Shimei, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,"
42,3,27,"the son of John, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,"
42,3,28,"the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,"
42,3,29,"the son of Jesus, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,"
42,3,30,"the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,"
42,3,31,"the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattathah, the son of Nathan, the son of David,"
42,3,32,"the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,"
42,3,33,"the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,"
42,3,34,"the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,"
42,3,35,"the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,"
42,3,36,"the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,"
42,3,37,"the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Kenan,"
42,3,38,"the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God."
42,4,1,"Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness"
42,4,2,"for forty days, being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. When they were completed, he was hungry."
42,4,3,"The devil said to him, If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread."
42,4,4,"Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone.'"
42,4,5,"He led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time."
42,4,6,"The devil said to him, I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want."
42,4,7,"If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours."
42,4,8,"Jesus answered and said to him, It is written, 'You shall worship the"
42,4,9,"He led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here,"
42,4,10,"for it is written,'He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;'"
42,4,11,"and,'On their hands they will bear you up,lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.'"
42,4,12,"Jesus answering, said to him, It is said, 'You shall not tempt the"
42,4,13,"When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until another time."
42,4,14,"Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and news about him spread through all the surrounding area."
42,4,15,"He taught in their synagogues, being praised by all."
42,4,16,"He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. He entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read."
42,4,17,"The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened the scroll, and found the place where it was written,"
42,4,18,"The Spirit of the"
42,4,19,"and to proclaim the acceptable year of the"
42,4,20,"He closed the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him."
42,4,21,"He began to tell them, Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."
42,4,22,"All testified about him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, and they said, Is not this Joseph's son?"
42,4,23,"He said to them, Doubtless you will tell me this parable, 'Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown.'"
42,4,24,"He said, Truly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown."
42,4,25,"But truly I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land."
42,4,26,"Elijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow."
42,4,27,"There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian."
42,4,28,"They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things."
42,4,29,"They rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff."
42,4,30,"But he, passing through the midst of them, went his way."
42,4,31,"He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,"
42,4,32,"and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority."
42,4,33,"In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he shouted with a loud voice,"
42,4,34,"saying, Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!"
42,4,35,"Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him! When the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm."
42,4,36,"Amazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!"
42,4,37,"News about him went out into every place of the surrounding region."
42,4,38,"He rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her."
42,4,39,"He stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them."
42,4,40,"When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them."
42,4,41,"Demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, You are the Son of God! Rebuking them, he did not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Messiah."
42,4,42,"When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he would not go away from them."
42,4,43,"But he said to them, I must proclaim the good news of the Kingdom of God to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent."
42,4,44,"He was proclaiming in the synagogues of Judea."
42,5,1,"Now it happened, while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret."
42,5,2,"He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets."
42,5,3,"He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat."
42,5,4,"When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch."
42,5,5,"Simon answered him, Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the nets."
42,5,6,"When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking."
42,5,7,"They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink."
42,5,8,"But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord."
42,5,9,"For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;"
42,5,10,"and so also were Jacob and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.Jesus said to Simon, Do not be afraid. From now on you will be catching men."
42,5,11,"When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him."
42,5,12,"It happened, while he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean."
42,5,13,"And he stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, I want to. Be made clean.Immediately the leprosy left him."
42,5,14,"He commanded him to tell no one, But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
42,5,15,"But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities."
42,5,16,"But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed."
42,5,17,"It happened on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the"
42,5,18,"Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus."
42,5,19,"Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus."
42,5,20,"Seeing their faith, he said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven you."
42,5,21,"The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"
42,5,22,"But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, Why are you reasoning so in your hearts?"
42,5,23,"Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you;' or to say, 'Arise and walk?'"
42,5,24,"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins (he said to the paralyzed man), I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house."
42,5,25,"Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God."
42,5,26,"Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today."
42,5,27,"After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, Follow me!"
42,5,28,"He left everything, and rose up and followed him."
42,5,29,"Levi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them."
42,5,30,"The Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?"
42,5,31,"Jesus answered them, Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do."
42,5,32,"I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
42,5,33,"They said to him, The disciples of John often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink."
42,5,34,"He said to them, Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them?"
42,5,35,"But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days."
42,5,36,"He also told a parable to them. No one having torn a piece from a new garment puts it on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old."
42,5,37,"And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed."
42,5,38,"But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins."
42,5,39,"No man having drunk old wine desires new, for he says, 'The old is better.'"
42,6,1,"Now it happened on a Sabbath that he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in their hands."
42,6,2,"But some of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?"
42,6,3,"Jesus, answering them, said, Have not you read what David did when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him;"
42,6,4,"how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?"
42,6,5,"He said to them, The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath."
42,6,6,"It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered."
42,6,7,"The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him."
42,6,8,"But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand in the middle. He arose and stood."
42,6,9,"Then Jesus said to them, I ask you: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to destroy it?"
42,6,10,"He looked around at them all, and said to the man, Stretch out your hand. He did, and his hand was restored."
42,6,11,"But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus."
42,6,12,"It happened in these days, that he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God."
42,6,13,"When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:"
42,6,14,"Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; Jacob; John; Philip; Bartholomew;"
42,6,15,"Matthew; Thomas; Jacob, the son of Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot;"
42,6,16,"Judas the son of Jacob; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor."
42,6,17,"He came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a large crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases;"
42,6,18,"as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed."
42,6,19,"All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out from him and healed them all."
42,6,20,"He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said,Blessed are you who are poor,for yours is the Kingdom of God."
42,6,21,"Blessed are you who hunger now,for you will be filled.Blessed are you who weep now,for you will laugh."
42,6,22,"Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake."
42,6,23,"Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets."
42,6,24,"But woe to you who are rich!For you have received your consolation."
42,6,25,"Woe to you, you who are full now,for you will be hungry.Woe to you who laugh now,for you will mourn and weep."
42,6,26,"Woe, when men speak well of you,for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets."
42,6,27,"But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,"
42,6,28,"bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you."
42,6,29,"To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your coat also."
42,6,30,"Give to everyone who asks you, and do not ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again."
42,6,31,"Treat others as you would have them treat you."
42,6,32,"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them."
42,6,33,"If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same."
42,6,34,"If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much."
42,6,35,"But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil."
42,6,36,"Therefore be merciful,even as your Father is also merciful."
42,6,37,"Do not judge,and you won't be judged.Do not condemn,and you won't be condemned.Set free,and you will be set free."
42,6,38,"Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you. For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you."
42,6,39,"He spoke a parable to them. Can the blind guide the blind? Won't they both fall into a pit?"
42,6,40,"A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher."
42,6,41,"And why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye, but do not consider the log that is in your own eye?"
42,6,42,"Or how can you tell your brother, 'Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the log from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye."
42,6,43,"For there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit; nor again a rotten tree that brings forth good fruit."
42,6,44,"For each tree is known by its own fruit. For people do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush."
42,6,45,"The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks."
42,6,46,"Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do the things which I say?"
42,6,47,"Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you who he is like."
42,6,48,"He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it had been well built."
42,6,49,"But he who hears, and does not do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great."
42,7,1,"After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum."
42,7,2,"A certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death."
42,7,3,"When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him Jewish elders, asking him to come and save his servant."
42,7,4,"When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, He is worthy for you to do this for him,"
42,7,5,"for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us."
42,7,6,"Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof."
42,7,7,"Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed."
42,7,8,"For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go!' and he goes; and to another, 'Come!' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
42,7,9,"When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel."
42,7,10,"Those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant was well."
42,7,11,"It happened soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain. His disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him."
42,7,12,"Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her."
42,7,13,"When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, Do not cry."
42,7,14,"He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, Young man, I tell you, arise!"
42,7,15,"He who was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother."
42,7,16,"Fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has arisen among us! and, God has visited his people!"
42,7,17,"This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region."
42,7,18,"The disciples of John told him about all these things."
42,7,19,"John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to the Lord, saying, Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?"
42,7,20,"When the men had come to him, they said, John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you the One who is to come, or should we look for another?'"
42,7,21,"In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight."
42,7,22,"Jesus answered them, Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them."
42,7,23,"Blessed is he who is not offended by me."
42,7,24,"When John's messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
42,7,25,"But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings' courts."
42,7,26,"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet."
42,7,27,"This is he of whom it is written,'Behold, I send my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way before you.'"
42,7,28,"For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John, yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he."
42,7,29,"When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptized with John's baptism."
42,7,30,"But the Pharisees and the Law scholars rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves."
42,7,31,"To what then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?"
42,7,32,"They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call one to another, saying, 'We piped to you, and you did not dance. We mourned, and you did not weep.'"
42,7,33,"For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'"
42,7,34,"The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'"
42,7,35,"Wisdom is justified by all her children."
42,7,36,"One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee's house, and sat at the table."
42,7,37,"Behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment."
42,7,38,"Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment."
42,7,39,"Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner."
42,7,40,"Jesus answered him, Simon, I have something to tell you.He said, Teacher, say on."
42,7,41,"A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty."
42,7,42,"When they could not pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?"
42,7,43,"Simon answered, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most.He said to him, You have judged correctly."
42,7,44,"Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair."
42,7,45,"You gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet."
42,7,46,"You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment."
42,7,47,"Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little."
42,7,48,"He said to her, Your sins are forgiven."
42,7,49,"Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?"
42,7,50,"He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."
42,8,1,"It happened soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God. With him were the twelve,"
42,8,2,"and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;"
42,8,3,"and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward; Susanna; and many others; who served them from their possessions."
42,8,4,"When a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable."
42,8,5,"The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it."
42,8,6,"Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture."
42,8,7,"Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it."
42,8,8,"Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times. As he said these things, he called out, He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"
42,8,9,"Then his disciples asked him, What does this parable mean?"
42,8,10,"He said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables; that 'seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'"
42,8,11,"Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God."
42,8,12,"Those along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved."
42,8,13,"Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation."
42,8,14,"That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity."
42,8,15,"That in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience."
42,8,16,"No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light."
42,8,17,"For nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light."
42,8,18,"Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever does not have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has."
42,8,19,"His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd."
42,8,20,"It was told him by some saying, Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you."
42,8,21,"But he answered them, My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it."
42,8,22,"Now it happened on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. So they launched out."
42,8,23,"But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water."
42,8,24,"So they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we are dying! And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm."
42,8,25,"He said to them, Where is your faith? Being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, Who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"
42,8,26,"They arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee."
42,8,27,"When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and did not live in a house, but in the tombs."
42,8,28,"When he saw Jesus, he shouted, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me!"
42,8,29,"For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert."
42,8,30,"Jesus asked him, What is your name?He said, Legion, for many demons had entered into him."
42,8,31,"They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss."
42,8,32,"Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them."
42,8,33,"The demons came out from the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned."
42,8,34,"When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country."
42,8,35,"Then people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid."
42,8,36,"Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed."
42,8,37,"All the people of the surrounding country of the Geresenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned."
42,8,38,"But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,"
42,8,39,"Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you. He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him."
42,8,40,"When Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him."
42,8,41,"Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus' feet, and begged him to come into his house,"
42,8,42,"for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him."
42,8,43,"A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,"
42,8,44,"came behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped."
42,8,45,"Jesus said, Who touched me?When all denied it, Peter said, Master, the multitudes press and jostle you."
42,8,46,"But Jesus said, Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me."
42,8,47,"When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately."
42,8,48,"He said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace."
42,8,49,"While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue's house came, saying to him, Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the Teacher."
42,8,50,"But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Do not be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed."
42,8,51,"When he came to the house, he did not allow anyone to enter in with him, except Peter, John, Jacob, the father of the child, and her mother."
42,8,52,"All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, Do not weep. She is not dead, but sleeping."
42,8,53,"They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead."
42,8,54,"But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Child, arise!"
42,8,55,"Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat."
42,8,56,"Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done."
42,9,1,"He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases."
42,9,2,"He sent them forth to proclaim the Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick."
42,9,3,"He said to them, Take nothing for your journey-neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece."
42,9,4,"Into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there."
42,9,5,"As many as do not receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them."
42,9,6,"They departed, and went throughout the villages, proclaiming the Good News, and healing everywhere."
42,9,7,"Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,"
42,9,8,"and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again."
42,9,9,"Herod said, John I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things? He sought to see him."
42,9,10,"The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done.He took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida."
42,9,11,"But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing."
42,9,12,"The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place."
42,9,13,"But he said to them, You give them something to eat.They said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people."
42,9,14,"For they were about five thousand men.He said to his disciples, Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each."
42,9,15,"They did so, and made them all sit down."
42,9,16,"He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude."
42,9,17,"They ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over."
42,9,18,"It happened, as he was praying alone, that the disciples were with him, and he asked them, Who do the multitudes say that I am?"
42,9,19,"They answered, 'John the Baptist,' but others say, 'Elijah,' and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again."
42,9,20,"He said to them, But who do you say that I am?Peter answered, The Messiah of God."
42,9,21,"But he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,"
42,9,22,"saying, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up."
42,9,23,"He said to all, If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me."
42,9,24,"For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save it."
42,9,25,"For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?"
42,9,26,"For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels."
42,9,27,"But I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Kingdom of God."
42,9,28,"It happened about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter, John, and Jacob, and went up onto the mountain to pray."
42,9,29,"As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling."
42,9,30,"Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,"
42,9,31,"who appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem."
42,9,32,"Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him."
42,9,33,"It happened, as they were parting from him, that Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah, not knowing what he said."
42,9,34,"While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud."
42,9,35,"A voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen. Listen to him!"
42,9,36,"When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen."
42,9,37,"It happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met him."
42,9,38,"Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child."
42,9,39,"Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely."
42,9,40,"I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they could not."
42,9,41,"Jesus answered, Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."
42,9,42,"While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father."
42,9,43,"They were all astonished at the majesty of God.But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,"
42,9,44,"Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men."
42,9,45,"But they did not understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying."
42,9,46,"There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest."
42,9,47,"Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,"
42,9,48,"and said to them, Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great."
42,9,49,"John answered, Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us."
42,9,50,"Jesus said to him, Do not forbid him, for he who is not against you is for you."
42,9,51,"It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,"
42,9,52,"and sent messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him."
42,9,53,"They did not receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem."
42,9,54,"When his disciples, Jacob and John, saw this, they said, Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them?"
42,9,55,"But he turned and rebuked them."
42,9,56,"They went to another village."
42,9,57,"As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, I want to follow you wherever you go."
42,9,58,"And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
42,9,59,"He said to another, Follow me!But he said, Allow me first to go and bury my father."
42,9,60,"But Jesus said to him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce the Kingdom of God."
42,9,61,"Another also said, I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to bid farewell to those who are at my house."
42,9,62,"But Jesus said to him, No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God."
42,10,1,"Now after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy-two others, and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city and place, where he was about to come."
42,10,2,"Then he said to them, The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest."
42,10,3,"Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves."
42,10,4,"Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals. Greet no one on the way."
42,10,5,"Into whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house.'"
42,10,6,"If a peaceful person is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you."
42,10,7,"Remain in that same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not go from house to house."
42,10,8,"Into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you."
42,10,9,"Heal the sick who are therein, and tell them, 'The Kingdom of God has come near to you.'"
42,10,10,"But into whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,"
42,10,11,"'Even the dust from your city that clings to our feet, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the Kingdom of God is near.'"
42,10,12,"I tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city."
42,10,13,"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
42,10,14,"But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you."
42,10,15,"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to hell."
42,10,16,"Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me."
42,10,17,"The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!"
42,10,18,"He said to them, I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven."
42,10,19,"Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you."
42,10,20,"Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."
42,10,21,"In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight."
42,10,22,"All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him."
42,10,23,"Turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,"
42,10,24,"for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and did not see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and did not hear them."
42,10,25,"Behold, a certain Law scholar stood up and tested him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
42,10,26,"He said to him, What is written in the Law? How do you read it?"
42,10,27,"He answered, You shall love the"
42,10,28,"He said to him, You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live."
42,10,29,"But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, Who is my neighbor?"
42,10,30,"Jesus answered, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead."
42,10,31,"By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side."
42,10,32,"In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side."
42,10,33,"But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion,"
42,10,34,"came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him."
42,10,35,"On the next day, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.'"
42,10,36,"Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?"
42,10,37,"He said, He who showed mercy on him.Then Jesus said to him, Go and do likewise."
42,10,38,"It happened as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him."
42,10,39,"She had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord's feet, and heard his word."
42,10,40,"But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up to him, and said, Lord, do you not care that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me."
42,10,41,"The Lord answered her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,"
42,10,42,"but one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her."
42,11,1,"It happened, that when he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples."
42,11,2,"He said to them, When you pray, say,'Father, may your name be kept holy.May your Kingdom come."
42,11,3,"Give us day by day our daily bread."
42,11,4,"Forgive us our sins,for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.And lead us not into temptation.'"
42,11,5,"He said to them, Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,"
42,11,6,"for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,'"
42,11,7,"and he from within will answer and say, 'Do not bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give it to you'?"
42,11,8,"I tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs."
42,11,9,"I tell you, ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened to you."
42,11,10,"For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened."
42,11,11,"Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, he won't give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?"
42,11,12,"Or if he asks for an egg, he won't give him a scorpion, will he?"
42,11,13,"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"
42,11,14,"He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. It happened, when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled."
42,11,15,"But some of them said, He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons."
42,11,16,"Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven."
42,11,17,"But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls."
42,11,18,"If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul."
42,11,19,"But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore will they be your judges."
42,11,20,"But if I by the finger of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you."
42,11,21,"When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe."
42,11,22,"But when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils."
42,11,23,"He that is not with me is against me. He who does not gather with me scatters."
42,11,24,"The unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, he says, 'I will turn back to my house from which I came out.'"
42,11,25,"When he returns, he finds it swept and put in order."
42,11,26,"Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first."
42,11,27,"It came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!"
42,11,28,"But he said, On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it."
42,11,29,"When the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say, This generation is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah."
42,11,30,"For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation."
42,11,31,"The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here."
42,11,32,"The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the proclaiming of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is here."
42,11,33,"No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light."
42,11,34,"The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is bad, your body also is full of darkness."
42,11,35,"Therefore see whether the light that is in you is not darkness."
42,11,36,"If therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light."
42,11,37,"Now as he spoke, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the table."
42,11,38,"When the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner."
42,11,39,"The Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness."
42,11,40,"You foolish ones, did not he who made the outside make the inside also?"
42,11,41,"But give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you."
42,11,42,"But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and the love of God. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone."
42,11,43,"Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces."
42,11,44,"Woe to you! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them do not know it."
42,11,45,"One of the Law scholars answered him, Teacher, in saying this you insult us also."
42,11,46,"He said, Woe to you Law scholars also! For you load people with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won't even lift one finger to help carry those burdens."
42,11,47,"Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them."
42,11,48,"So you are witnesses and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs."
42,11,49,"Therefore also the wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,"
42,11,50,"that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;"
42,11,51,"from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.' Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation."
42,11,52,"Woe to you Law scholars! For you took away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered."
42,11,53,"And when he left there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him;"
42,11,54,"lying in wait for him, to catch him in something he might say."
42,12,1,"Meanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they trampled on each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."
42,12,2,"But there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known."
42,12,3,"Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops."
42,12,4,"I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do."
42,12,5,"But I will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him, who after he has killed, has power to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him."
42,12,6,"Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria coins? Not one of them is forgotten by God."
42,12,7,"But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore do not be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows."
42,12,8,"I tell you, everyone who confesses me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God;"
42,12,9,"but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God."
42,12,10,"Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven."
42,12,11,"When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do not be anxious how or what you will answer, or what you will say;"
42,12,12,"for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say."
42,12,13,"One of the multitude said to him, Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."
42,12,14,"But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?"
42,12,15,"He said to them, Beware! Keep yourselves from all covetousness, for a man's life does not consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses."
42,12,16,"He spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly."
42,12,17,"He reasoned within himself, saying, 'What will I do, because I do not have room to store my crops?'"
42,12,18,"He said, 'This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods."
42,12,19,"I will tell my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be merry.'"
42,12,20,"But God said to him, 'You foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you have prepared-whose will they be?'"
42,12,21,"So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."
42,12,22,"He said to his disciples, Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear."
42,12,23,"Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing."
42,12,24,"Consider the ravens: they do not sow, they do not reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!"
42,12,25,"Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height?"
42,12,26,"If then you are not able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?"
42,12,27,"Consider the lilies, how they grow. They do not toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
42,12,28,"But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?"
42,12,29,"Do not seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious."
42,12,30,"For the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these things."
42,12,31,"But seek his Kingdom, and these things will be added to you."
42,12,32,"Do not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom."
42,12,33,"Sell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys."
42,12,34,"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
42,12,35,"Let your waist be girded and your lamps burning."
42,12,36,"Be like people watching for their lord, when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him."
42,12,37,"Blessed are those servants, whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Truly I tell you, that he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them."
42,12,38,"They will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so."
42,12,39,"But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would not have allowed his house to be broken into."
42,12,40,"Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you do not expect him."
42,12,41,"Peter said to him, Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?"
42,12,42,"The Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times?"
42,12,43,"Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes."
42,12,44,"Truly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has."
42,12,45,"But if that servant says in his heart, 'My lord delays his coming,' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,"
42,12,46,"then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he is not expecting him, and in an hour that he does not know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful."
42,12,47,"That servant, who knew his lord's will, and did not prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many stripes,"
42,12,48,"but he who did not know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whomever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked."
42,12,49,"I came to throw fire on the earth. I wish it were already kindled."
42,12,50,"But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!"
42,12,51,"Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division."
42,12,52,"For from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three."
42,12,53,"They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."
42,12,54,"He said to the multitudes also, When you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it happens."
42,12,55,"When a south wind blows, you say, 'There will be a scorching heat,' and it happens."
42,12,56,"You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you do not interpret this time?"
42,12,57,"Why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?"
42,12,58,"For when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison."
42,12,59,"I tell you, you will by no means get out of there, until you have paid the very last penny."
42,13,1,"Now there were some present at the same time who told him about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices."
42,13,2,"Jesus answered them, Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered these things?"
42,13,3,"I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way."
42,13,4,"Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem?"
42,13,5,"I tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way."
42,13,6,"He spoke this parable. A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none."
42,13,7,"He said to the vine dresser, 'Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?'"
42,13,8,"He answered, 'Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it."
42,13,9,"If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.'"
42,13,10,"He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day."
42,13,11,"Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in no way straighten herself up."
42,13,12,"When Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, Woman, you are freed from your infirmity."
42,13,13,"He laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and glorified God."
42,13,14,"The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, There are six days in which men ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!"
42,13,15,"Therefore the Lord answered him, You hypocrites! Does not each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away to water?"
42,13,16,"Ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen long years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?"
42,13,17,"As he said these things, all his adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him."
42,13,18,"He said, What is the Kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it?"
42,13,19,"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and put in his own garden. It grew, and became a tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches."
42,13,20,"Again he said, To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?"
42,13,21,"It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened."
42,13,22,"He went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem."
42,13,23,"One said to him, Lord, are they few who are saved?He said to them,"
42,13,24,"Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able."
42,13,25,"When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us!' then he will answer and tell you, 'I do not know you or where you come from.'"
42,13,26,"Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.'"
42,13,27,"He will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.'"
42,13,28,"There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside."
42,13,29,"They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of God."
42,13,30,"Behold, there are some who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last."
42,13,31,"In that same hour some Pharisees came, saying to him, Get out of here, and go away, for Herod wants to kill you."
42,13,32,"He said to them, Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission."
42,13,33,"Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it cannot be that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.'"
42,13,34,"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you refused!"
42,13,35,"Behold, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the"
42,14,1,"It happened, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him."
42,14,2,"Behold, a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him."
42,14,3,"Jesus, answering, spoke to the Law scholars and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?"
42,14,4,"But they were silent.He took him, and healed him, and let him go."
42,14,5,"He answered them, Which of you, if your son or an ox fell into a well, would not immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?"
42,14,6,"They could not answer him regarding these things."
42,14,7,"He spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to them,"
42,14,8,"When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, do not sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him,"
42,14,9,"and he who invited both of you would come and tell you, 'Make room for this person.' Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place."
42,14,10,"But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may tell you, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you."
42,14,11,"For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."
42,14,12,"He also said to the one who had invited him, When you make a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay you back."
42,14,13,"But when you make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind;"
42,14,14,"and you will be blessed, because they do not have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous."
42,14,15,"When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he who will eat bread in the Kingdom of God!"
42,14,16,"But he said to him, A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people."
42,14,17,"He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, 'Come, for everything is ready now.'"
42,14,18,"They all as one began to make excuses.The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.'"
42,14,19,"Another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused.'"
42,14,20,"Another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.'"
42,14,21,"That servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.'"
42,14,22,"The servant said, 'Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.'"
42,14,23,"The lord said to the servant, 'Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled."
42,14,24,"For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper.'"
42,14,25,"Now great multitudes were going with him. He turned and said to them,"
42,14,26,"If anyone comes to me, and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."
42,14,27,"Whoever does not bear his own cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple."
42,14,28,"For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?"
42,14,29,"Or perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock him,"
42,14,30,"saying, 'This man began to build, and was not able to finish.'"
42,14,31,"Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?"
42,14,32,"Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks for conditions of peace."
42,14,33,"So therefore whoever of you who does not renounce all that he has, he cannot be my disciple."
42,14,34,"Salt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?"
42,14,35,"It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
42,15,1,"Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him."
42,15,2,"The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them."
42,15,3,"He told them this parable."
42,15,4,"Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, would not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?"
42,15,5,"When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing."
42,15,6,"When he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!'"
42,15,7,"I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance."
42,15,8,"Or what woman, if she had ten drachma coins, if she lost one drachma coin, would not light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?"
42,15,9,"When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.'"
42,15,10,"Even so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting."
42,15,11,"He said, A certain man had two sons."
42,15,12,"The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of your property.' He divided his livelihood between them."
42,15,13,"Not many days after, the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There he wasted his property with riotous living."
42,15,14,"When he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need."
42,15,15,"He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs."
42,15,16,"He wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any."
42,15,17,"But when he came to himself he said, 'How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough to spare, and I'm dying with hunger!"
42,15,18,"I will get up and go to my father, and will tell him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight."
42,15,19,"I am no more worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.'"
42,15,20,"He arose, and came to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him."
42,15,21,"The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'"
42,15,22,"But the father said to his servants, 'Quickly, bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet."
42,15,23,"Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat, and celebrate;"
42,15,24,"for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.' They began to celebrate."
42,15,25,"Now his elder son was in the field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing."
42,15,26,"He called one of the servants to him, and asked what was going on."
42,15,27,"He said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and healthy.'"
42,15,28,"But he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him."
42,15,29,"But he answered his father, 'Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends."
42,15,30,"But when this, your son, came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.'"
42,15,31,"He said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours."
42,15,32,"But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.'"
42,16,1,"He also said to his disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions."
42,16,2,"He called him, and said to him, 'What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.'"
42,16,3,"The manager said within himself, 'What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me? I do not have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg."
42,16,4,"I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.'"
42,16,5,"Calling each one of his lord's debtors to him, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe to my lord?'"
42,16,6,"He said, 'A hundred batos of oil.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'"
42,16,7,"Then said he to another, 'How much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred cors of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'"
42,16,8,"His lord commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness, for the sons of this world are, in their own generation, more shrewd than the sons of light."
42,16,9,"I tell you, make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tents."
42,16,10,"He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much."
42,16,11,"If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?"
42,16,12,"If you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?"
42,16,13,"No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You are not able to serve God and wealth."
42,16,14,"The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him."
42,16,15,"He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God."
42,16,16,"The Law and the Prophets were until John. From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it."
42,16,17,"But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the Law to become void."
42,16,18,"Everyone who divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery."
42,16,19,"Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every day."
42,16,20,"A certain beggar, named Lazarus, was placed at his gate, full of sores,"
42,16,21,"and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. Yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores."
42,16,22,"It happened that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried."
42,16,23,"In hell, he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus at his bosom."
42,16,24,"He called out and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish in this flame.'"
42,16,25,"But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and Lazarus, in like manner, bad things. But now here he is comforted and you are in anguish."
42,16,26,"Besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, and that none may cross over from there to us.'"
42,16,27,"He said, 'I ask you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house;"
42,16,28,"for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, so they won't also come into this place of torment.'"
42,16,29,"But Abraham said to him, 'They have Moses and the Prophets. Let them listen to them.'"
42,16,30,"He said, 'No, father Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'"
42,16,31,"He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead.'"
42,17,1,"He said to the disciples, It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come!"
42,17,2,"It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble."
42,17,3,"Be careful. If your brother sins, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him."
42,17,4,"If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns to you, saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive him."
42,17,5,"The apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith."
42,17,6,"The Lord said, If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, 'Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you."
42,17,7,"But who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when he comes in from the field, 'Come immediately and sit down at the table,'"
42,17,8,"and will not rather tell him, 'Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink'?"
42,17,9,"Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded?"
42,17,10,"Even so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty.'"
42,17,11,"It happened as he was on his way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee."
42,17,12,"As he entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance."
42,17,13,"They lifted up their voices, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
42,17,14,"When he saw them, he said to them, Go and show yourselves to the priests. It happened that as they went, they were cleansed."
42,17,15,"One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice."
42,17,16,"He fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan."
42,17,17,"Jesus answered, Weren't the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?"
42,17,18,"Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?"
42,17,19,"Then he said to him, Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you."
42,17,20,"Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come, he answered them, The Kingdom of God does not come with observation;"
42,17,21,"neither will they say, 'Look, here!' or, 'Look, there!' for the Kingdom of God is within you."
42,17,22,"He said to the disciples, The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it."
42,17,23,"And they will tell you, 'Look, there!' or 'Look, here!' Do not go away, nor follow after them,"
42,17,24,"for as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day."
42,17,25,"But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation."
42,17,26,"As it happened in the days of Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man."
42,17,27,"They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all."
42,17,28,"Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;"
42,17,29,"but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all."
42,17,30,"It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed."
42,17,31,"In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back."
42,17,32,"Remember Lot's wife!"
42,17,33,"Whoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it."
42,17,34,"I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left."
42,17,35,"There will be two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left."
42,17,37,"They, answering, asked him, Where, Lord?He said to them, Where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together."
42,18,1,"He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up,"
42,18,2,"saying, There was a judge in a certain city who did not fear God, and did not respect man."
42,18,3,"A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, 'Defend me from my adversary!'"
42,18,4,"He would not for a while, but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I neither fear God, nor respect man,"
42,18,5,"yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.'"
42,18,6,"The Lord said, Listen to what the unrighteous judge says."
42,18,7,"Won't God avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them?"
42,18,8,"I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"
42,18,9,"He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others."
42,18,10,"Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector."
42,18,11,"The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: 'God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector."
42,18,12,"I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.'"
42,18,13,"But the tax collector, standing far away, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'"
42,18,14,"I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted."
42,18,15,"Now they were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them."
42,18,16,"Jesus summoned them, saying, Allow the little children to come to me, and do not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
42,18,17,"Truly, I tell you, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it."
42,18,18,"A certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
42,18,19,"Jesus asked him, Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one-God."
42,18,20,"You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not murder,' 'Do not steal,' 'Do not give false testimony,' 'Honor your father and your mother.'"
42,18,21,"He said, I have observed all these things from my youth up."
42,18,22,"When Jesus heard it, he said to him, You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me."
42,18,23,"But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich."
42,18,24,"Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said, How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!"
42,18,25,"For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."
42,18,26,"Those who heard it said, Then who can be saved?"
42,18,27,"But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."
42,18,28,"Peter said, Look, we have left our homes and followed you."
42,18,29,"He said to them, Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the Kingdom of God's sake,"
42,18,30,"who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life."
42,18,31,"He took the twelve aside, and said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed."
42,18,32,"For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on."
42,18,33,"They will scourge and kill him. On the third day, he will rise again."
42,18,34,"They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not understand the things that were said."
42,18,35,"It happened, as he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging."
42,18,36,"Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant."
42,18,37,"They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by."
42,18,38,"He called out, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!"
42,18,39,"Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he shouted all the more, You son of David, have mercy on me!"
42,18,40,"Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,"
42,18,41,"What do you want me to do?He said, Lord, that I may see again."
42,18,42,"Jesus said to him, Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you."
42,18,43,"And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God."
42,19,1,"He entered and was passing through Jericho."
42,19,2,"There was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich."
42,19,3,"He was trying to see who Jesus was, and could not because of the crowd, because he was short."
42,19,4,"He ran on ahead, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way."
42,19,5,"When Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house."
42,19,6,"He hurried, came down, and received him joyfully."
42,19,7,"And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner."
42,19,8,"Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much."
42,19,9,"Jesus said to him, Today, salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham."
42,19,10,"For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost."
42,19,11,"As they heard these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately."
42,19,12,"He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return."
42,19,13,"He called ten servants of his, and gave them ten mina coins, and told them, 'Conduct business until I come.'"
42,19,14,"But his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to reign over us.'"
42,19,15,"It happened when he had come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business."
42,19,16,"The first came before him, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.'"
42,19,17,"He said to him, 'Well done, you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.'"
42,19,18,"The second came, saying, 'Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.'"
42,19,19,"So he said to him, 'And you are to be over five cities.'"
42,19,20,"Another came, saying, 'Lord, behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief,"
42,19,21,"for I feared you, because you are an exacting man. You take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow.'"
42,19,22,"He said to him, 'Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow."
42,19,23,"Then why did you not deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?'"
42,19,24,"He said to those who stood by, 'Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten minas.'"
42,19,25,"They said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas!'"
42,19,26,"'For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away."
42,19,27,"But bring those enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me.'"
42,19,28,"Having said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem."
42,19,29,"It happened, when he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mountain that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,"
42,19,30,"saying, Go your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat. Untie it, and bring it."
42,19,31,"If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say to him: 'The Lord needs it.'"
42,19,32,"Those who were sent went away, and found things just as he had told them."
42,19,33,"As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, Why are you untying the colt?"
42,19,34,"They said, The Lord needs it."
42,19,35,"They brought it to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on the colt, and set Jesus on them."
42,19,36,"As he went, they spread their cloaks in the way."
42,19,37,"As he was now getting near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,"
42,19,38,"saying, Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the"
42,19,39,"Some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples!"
42,19,40,"He answered them, I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out."
42,19,41,"When he drew near, he saw the city and wept over it,"
42,19,42,"saying, If you, even you, had known today the things which belong to your peace! But now, they are hidden from your eyes."
42,19,43,"For the days will come on you, when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem you in on every side,"
42,19,44,"and will dash you and your children within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on another, because you did not know the time of your visitation."
42,19,45,"He entered into the temple, and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,"
42,19,46,"saying to them, It is written, 'My house is a house of prayer,' but you have made it a 'den of robbers'!"
42,19,47,"He was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him."
42,19,48,"They could not find what they might do, for all the people hung on to every word that he said."
42,20,1,"It happened on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and proclaiming the Good News, that the chief priests and scribes came to him with the elders."
42,20,2,"They asked him, Tell us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you this authority?"
42,20,3,"He answered them, I also will ask you one question. Tell me:"
42,20,4,"the baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from man?"
42,20,5,"They reasoned with themselves, saying, If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why did you not believe him?'"
42,20,6,"But if we say, 'From man,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet."
42,20,7,"They answered that they did not know where it was from."
42,20,8,"Jesus said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
42,20,9,"He began to tell the people this parable. A man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went on a journey for a long time."
42,20,10,"At the proper season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty."
42,20,11,"He sent yet another servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty."
42,20,12,"He sent yet a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out."
42,20,13,"The lord of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that they will respect him.'"
42,20,14,"But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'"
42,20,15,"They threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?"
42,20,16,"He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.When they heard it, they said, May it never be!"
42,20,17,"But he looked at them, and said, Then what is this that is written,'The stone which the builders rejected,the same was made the chief cornerstone?'"
42,20,18,"Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces,but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust."
42,20,19,"The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the people-for they knew he had spoken this parable against them."
42,20,20,"They watched him, and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor."
42,20,21,"They asked him, Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and are not partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God."
42,20,22,"Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
42,20,23,"But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them,"
42,20,24,"Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?They answered, Caesar's."
42,20,25,"He said to them, Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
42,20,26,"They weren't able to trap him in his words before the people. They marveled at his answer, and were silent."
42,20,27,"Some of the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection."
42,20,28,"They asked him, Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up children for his brother."
42,20,29,"There were therefore seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless."
42,20,30,"The second and"
42,20,31,"the third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died."
42,20,32,"Afterward the woman also died."
42,20,33,"Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a wife."
42,20,34,"Jesus said to them, The sons of this age marry, and are given in marriage."
42,20,35,"But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage."
42,20,36,"For they cannot die any more, for they are like the angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection."
42,20,37,"But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the"
42,20,38,"Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him."
42,20,39,"Some of the scribes answered, Teacher, you speak well."
42,20,40,"They did not dare to ask him any more questions."
42,20,41,"He said to them, Why do they say that the Messiah is David's son?"
42,20,42,"David himself says in the scroll of Psalms,'The"
42,20,43,"until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.'"
42,20,44,"David therefore calls him Lord, so how is he his son?"
42,20,45,"In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,"
42,20,46,"Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;"
42,20,47,"who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater condemnation."
42,21,1,"He looked up, and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury."
42,21,2,"He saw a certain poor widow casting in two small brass coins."
42,21,3,"He said, Truly I tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of them,"
42,21,4,"for all these put in gifts from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she had to live on."
42,21,5,"As some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,"
42,21,6,"As for these things which you see, the days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down."
42,21,7,"They asked him, Teacher, so when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are about to happen?"
42,21,8,"He said, Watch out that you do not get led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.' Therefore do not follow them."
42,21,9,"When you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end won't come immediately."
42,21,10,"Then he said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom."
42,21,11,"There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be terrors and great signs from heaven."
42,21,12,"But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name's sake."
42,21,13,"It will turn out as a testimony for you."
42,21,14,"Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer,"
42,21,15,"for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict."
42,21,16,"You will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will cause some of you to be put to death."
42,21,17,"You will be hated by all men for my name's sake."
42,21,18,"And not a hair of your head will perish."
42,21,19,"By your endurance you will win your lives."
42,21,20,"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near."
42,21,21,"Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the midst of her depart. Let those who are in the country not enter therein."
42,21,22,"For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled."
42,21,23,"Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land, and wrath to this people."
42,21,24,"They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled."
42,21,25,"There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves;"
42,21,26,"men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken."
42,21,27,"Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory."
42,21,28,"But when these things begin to happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near."
42,21,29,"He told them a parable. See the fig tree, and all the trees."
42,21,30,"When they are already budding, you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near."
42,21,31,"Even so you also, when you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near."
42,21,32,"Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished."
42,21,33,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away."
42,21,34,"So be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come on you suddenly."
42,21,35,"For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth."
42,21,36,"Therefore be watchful all the time, praying that you may be able to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man."
42,21,37,"Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple, and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet."
42,21,38,"All the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him."
42,22,1,"Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, drew near."
42,22,2,"The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people."
42,22,3,"Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot, who was numbered with the twelve."
42,22,4,"He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them."
42,22,5,"They were glad, and agreed to give him money."
42,22,6,"He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude."
42,22,7,"The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed."
42,22,8,"He sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat."
42,22,9,"They said to him, Where do you want us to prepare?"
42,22,10,"He said to them, Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters."
42,22,11,"Tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'"
42,22,12,"He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there."
42,22,13,"They went, found things as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover."
42,22,14,"When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve."
42,22,15,"He said to them, I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,"
42,22,16,"for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God."
42,22,17,"He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and share it among yourselves,"
42,22,18,"for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until the Kingdom of God comes."
42,22,19,"He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me."
42,22,20,"Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the New Covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you."
42,22,21,"But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table."
42,22,22,"The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!"
42,22,23,"They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing."
42,22,24,"There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest."
42,22,25,"He said to them, The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called 'benefactors.'"
42,22,26,"But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves."
42,22,27,"For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Is not it he who sits at the table? But I am in the midst of you as one who serves."
42,22,28,"But you are those who have continued with me in my trials."
42,22,29,"I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me,"
42,22,30,"that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
42,22,31,"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat,"
42,22,32,"but I prayed for you, that your faith would not fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers."
42,22,33,"He said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!"
42,22,34,"He said, I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times."
42,22,35,"He said to them, When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?They said, Nothing."
42,22,36,"Then he said to them, But now, whoever has a purse must take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, must sell his cloak, and buy a sword."
42,22,37,"For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: 'He was counted with the lawless.' For that which concerns me has an end."
42,22,38,"They said, Lord, behold, here are two swords.He said to them, That is enough."
42,22,39,"He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him."
42,22,40,"When he was at the place, he said to them, Pray that you do not enter into temptation."
42,22,41,"He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and he knelt down and prayed,"
42,22,42,"saying, Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."
42,22,43,"An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him."
42,22,44,"Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground."
42,22,45,"When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,"
42,22,46,"and said to them, Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation."
42,22,47,"While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him."
42,22,48,"But Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?"
42,22,49,"When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"
42,22,50,"A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear."
42,22,51,"But Jesus answered, Let me at least do this-and he touched his ear, and healed him."
42,22,52,"Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?"
42,22,53,"When I was with you in the temple daily, you did not stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."
42,22,54,"They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter followed from a distance."
42,22,55,"When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them."
42,22,56,"A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, This man also was with him."
42,22,57,"He denied Jesus, saying, Woman, I do not know him."
42,22,58,"After a little while someone else saw him, and said, You also are one of them!But Peter answered, Man, I am not!"
42,22,59,"After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!"
42,22,60,"But Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are talking about! Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed."
42,22,61,"The Lord turned, and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord's word, how he said to him, Before the rooster crows today you will deny me three times."
42,22,62,"And he went out, and wept bitterly."
42,22,63,"The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him."
42,22,64,"Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?"
42,22,65,"They spoke many other things against him, insulting him."
42,22,66,"As soon as it was day, the council of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,"
42,22,67,"If you are the Messiah, tell us.But he said to them, If I tell you, you won't believe,"
42,22,68,"and if I ask, you will in no way answer me."
42,22,69,"From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God."
42,22,70,"They all said, Are you then the Son of God?He said to them, You say it, because I am."
42,22,71,"They said, Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!"
42,23,1,"The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate."
42,23,2,"They began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is the Messiah, a king."
42,23,3,"Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews?He answered him, So you say."
42,23,4,"Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no basis for a charge against this man."
42,23,5,"But they insisted, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place."
42,23,6,"But when Pilate heard it, he asked if the man was a Galilean."
42,23,7,"When he found out that he was in Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days."
42,23,8,"Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard concerning him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him."
42,23,9,"He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers."
42,23,10,"The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him."
42,23,11,"Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate."
42,23,12,"Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other."
42,23,13,"Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,"
42,23,14,"and said to them, You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him."
42,23,15,"Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him."
42,23,16,"I will therefore chastise him and release him."
42,23,18,"But they all shouted out together, saying, Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!-"
42,23,19,"one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder."
42,23,20,"Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,"
42,23,21,"but they shouted, saying, Crucify! Crucify him!"
42,23,22,"He said to them the third time, Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him."
42,23,23,"But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed."
42,23,24,"Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done."
42,23,25,"He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will."
42,23,26,"When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and placed on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus."
42,23,27,"A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him."
42,23,28,"But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children."
42,23,29,"For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'"
42,23,30,"Then they will begin to tell the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and tell the hills, 'Cover us.'"
42,23,31,"For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?"
42,23,32,"There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death."
42,23,33,"When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left."
42,23,34,"Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots."
42,23,35,"The people stood watching. The rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!"
42,23,36,"The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,"
42,23,37,"and saying, If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"
42,23,38,"An inscription was also written above him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
42,23,39,"One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!"
42,23,40,"But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?"
42,23,41,"And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong."
42,23,42,"And he said, Jesus, remember me when you come into your Kingdom."
42,23,43,"And he said to him, Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise."
42,23,44,"It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour."
42,23,45,"The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two."
42,23,46,"Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into your hands I commit my spirit! Having said this, he breathed his last."
42,23,47,"When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man."
42,23,48,"All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts."
42,23,49,"All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things."
42,23,50,"Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man"
42,23,51,"(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Judeans, who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God:"
42,23,52,"this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus."
42,23,53,"He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and placed him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been placed."
42,23,54,"It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near."
42,23,55,"The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was placed."
42,23,56,"They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment."
42,24,1,"But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared."
42,24,2,"They found the stone rolled away from the tomb."
42,24,3,"They entered in, and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus."
42,24,4,"It happened, while they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing."
42,24,5,"Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth.They said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead?"
42,24,6,"He is not here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,"
42,24,7,"saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?"
42,24,8,"They remembered his words,"
42,24,9,"returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the Eleven, and to all the rest."
42,24,10,"Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of Jacob. The other women with them told these things to the apostles."
42,24,11,"These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they did not believe them."
42,24,12,"But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened."
42,24,13,"Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem."
42,24,14,"They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened."
42,24,15,"It happened, while they talked and questioned together, that Jesus himself came near, and went with them."
42,24,16,"But their eyes were kept from recognizing him."
42,24,17,"He said to them, What are you talking about as you walk? They stood still, looking sad."
42,24,18,"One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things which have happened there in these days?"
42,24,19,"He said to them, What things?They said to him, The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;"
42,24,20,"and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him."
42,24,21,"But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened."
42,24,22,"Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb;"
42,24,23,"and when they did not find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive."
42,24,24,"Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they did not see him."
42,24,25,"Then he said to them, O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!"
42,24,26,"Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?"
42,24,27,"Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself."
42,24,28,"They drew near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he would go further."
42,24,29,"They urged him, saying, Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over.He went in to stay with them."
42,24,30,"It happened, that when he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave to them."
42,24,31,"Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight."
42,24,32,"They said one to another, Weren't our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?"
42,24,33,"They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,"
42,24,34,"saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"
42,24,35,"They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread."
42,24,36,"As they said these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, Peace be to you."
42,24,37,"But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit."
42,24,38,"He said to them, Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your hearts?"
42,24,39,"See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have."
42,24,40,"When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet."
42,24,41,"While they still did not believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Do you have anything here to eat?"
42,24,42,"They gave him a piece of a broiled fish."
42,24,43,"He took it and ate in front of them."
42,24,44,"He said to them, This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled."
42,24,45,"Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures."
42,24,46,"He said to them, Thus it is written, for the Messiah to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,"
42,24,47,"and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem."
42,24,48,"You are witnesses of these things."
42,24,49,"Behold, I send forth the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."
42,24,50,"He led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them."
42,24,51,"It happened, while he blessed them, that he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven."
42,24,52,"They worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,"
42,24,53,"and were continually in the temple, blessing God."
43,1,1,"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
43,1,2,"The same was in the beginning with God."
43,1,3,"All things were made through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made."
43,1,4,"In him was life, and the life was the light of men."
43,1,5,"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn't overcome it."
43,1,6,"There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John."
43,1,7,"The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him."
43,1,8,"He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light."
43,1,9,"The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world."
43,1,10,"He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world did not recognize him."
43,1,11,"He came to his own, and those who were his own did not receive him."
43,1,12,"But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God's children, to those who believe in his name:"
43,1,13,"who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."
43,1,14,"The Word became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth."
43,1,15,"John testified about him. He shouted out, saying, This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.'"
43,1,16,"For of his fullness we all received, and grace upon grace."
43,1,17,"For the Law was given through Moses, grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ."
43,1,18,"No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him."
43,1,19,"This is John's testimony, when the Jewish leaders sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?"
43,1,20,"He confessed, and did not deny, but he confessed, I am not the Messiah."
43,1,21,"They asked him, What then? Are you Elijah?He said, I am not.Are you the prophet?He answered, No."
43,1,22,"They said therefore to him, Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
43,1,23,"He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the"
43,1,24,"The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees."
43,1,25,"They asked him, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?"
43,1,26,"John answered them, I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you do not know."
43,1,27,"He is the one who comes after me, whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to loosen."
43,1,28,"These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing."
43,1,29,"The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"
43,1,30,"This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.'"
43,1,31,"I did not know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel."
43,1,32,"John testified, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him."
43,1,33,"I did not recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, 'On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'"
43,1,34,"I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God. "
43,1,35,"Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,"
43,1,36,"and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God!"
43,1,37,"The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus."
43,1,38,"Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, What are you looking for?They said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where are you staying?"
43,1,39,"He said to them, Come, and you will see.They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour."
43,1,40,"One of the two who heard John, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother."
43,1,41,"He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messiah! (which is, being interpreted, Christ)."
43,1,42,"He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter)."
43,1,43,"On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him, Follow me."
43,1,44,"Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter."
43,1,45,"Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the Law, and the Prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
43,1,46,"Nathanael said to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?Philip said to him, Come and see."
43,1,47,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
43,1,48,"Nathanael said to him, How do you know me?Jesus answered him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
43,1,49,"Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!"
43,1,50,"Jesus answered him, Because I told you, 'I saw you underneath the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these!"
43,1,51,"He said to him, Truly, truly, I tell you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
43,2,1,"The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus' mother was there."
43,2,2,"Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the marriage."
43,2,3,"When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother said to him, They have no wine."
43,2,4,"Jesus said to her, Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come."
43,2,5,"His mother said to the servants, Whatever he says to you, do it."
43,2,6,"Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jewish manner of purifying, containing two or three metretes apiece."
43,2,7,"Jesus said to them, Fill the water pots with water. They filled them up to the brim."
43,2,8,"He said to them, Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast. So they took it."
43,2,9,"When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,"
43,2,10,"and said to him, Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!"
43,2,11,"This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him."
43,2,12,"After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days."
43,2,13,"The Jewish Passover was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
43,2,14,"He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting."
43,2,15,"He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables."
43,2,16,"To those who sold the doves, he said, Take these things out of here! Do not make my Father's house a marketplace!"
43,2,17,"His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for your house will eat me up."
43,2,18,"The Jewish leaders therefore answered him, What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?"
43,2,19,"Jesus answered them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
43,2,20,"The Jewish leaders therefore said, Forty-six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?"
43,2,21,"But he spoke of the temple of his body."
43,2,22,"When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said."
43,2,23,"Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did."
43,2,24,"But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew everyone,"
43,2,25,"and because he did not need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man."
43,3,1,"Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jewish people."
43,3,2,"The same came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him."
43,3,3,"Jesus answered him, Truly, truly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, he cannot see the Kingdom of God."
43,3,4,"Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"
43,3,5,"Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God!"
43,3,6,"That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
43,3,7,"Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born anew.'"
43,3,8,"The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."
43,3,9,"Nicodemus answered him, How can these things be?"
43,3,10,"Jesus answered him, Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things?"
43,3,11,"Truly, truly, I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you do not receive our witness."
43,3,12,"If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?"
43,3,13,"No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man."
43,3,14,"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,"
43,3,15,"that whoever believes in him may have eternal life."
43,3,16,"For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life."
43,3,17,"For God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him."
43,3,18,"He who believes in him is not judged. He who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God."
43,3,19,"This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil."
43,3,20,"For everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works would be exposed."
43,3,21,"But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God."
43,3,22,"After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them, and baptized."
43,3,23,"John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were baptized."
43,3,24,"For John was not yet thrown into prison."
43,3,25,"There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purification."
43,3,26,"They came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and everyone is coming to him."
43,3,27,"John answered, A man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven."
43,3,28,"You yourselves bear me witness that I said, 'I am not the Messiah,' but, 'I have been sent before him.'"
43,3,29,"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full."
43,3,30,"He must increase, but I must decrease."
43,3,31,"He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the Earth belongs to the Earth, and speaks of the Earth. He who comes from heaven is above all."
43,3,32,"What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness."
43,3,33,"He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true."
43,3,34,"For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for he gives the Spirit without measure."
43,3,35,"The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand."
43,3,36,"One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won't see life, but the wrath of God remains on him."
43,4,1,"Therefore when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John"
43,4,2,"(although Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples),"
43,4,3,"he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee."
43,4,4,"He needed to pass through Samaria."
43,4,5,"So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph."
43,4,6,"Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour."
43,4,7,"A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give me a drink."
43,4,8,"For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food."
43,4,9,"The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)"
43,4,10,"Jesus answered her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."
43,4,11,"The woman said to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. From where then have you that living water?"
43,4,12,"Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?"
43,4,13,"Jesus answered her, Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,"
43,4,14,"but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life."
43,4,15,"The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, so that I do not get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw."
43,4,16,"Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come here."
43,4,17,"The woman answered and said to him I have no husband.Jesus said to her, You said well, 'I have no husband,'"
43,4,18,"for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly."
43,4,19,"The woman said to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet."
43,4,20,"Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship."
43,4,21,"Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father."
43,4,22,"You worship that which you do not know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews."
43,4,23,"But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers."
43,4,24,"God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."
43,4,25,"The woman said to him, I know that Messiah comes, (he who is called Christ). When he has come, he will declare to us all things."
43,4,26,"Jesus said to her, I am he, the one who speaks to you."
43,4,27,"At this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, What are you looking for? or, Why do you speak with her?"
43,4,28,"So the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,"
43,4,29,"Come, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Messiah?"
43,4,30,"They went out of the city, and were coming to him."
43,4,31,"In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, Rabbi, eat."
43,4,32,"But he said to them, I have food to eat that you do not know about."
43,4,33,"The disciples therefore said one to another, Has anyone brought him something to eat?"
43,4,34,"Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work."
43,4,35,"Do you not say, 'There are yet four months until the harvest?' Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already."
43,4,36,"He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together."
43,4,37,"For in this the saying is true, 'One sows, and another reaps.'"
43,4,38,"I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor."
43,4,39,"From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me everything that I did."
43,4,40,"So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days."
43,4,41,"Many more believed because of his word."
43,4,42,"They said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Savior of the world."
43,4,43,"After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee."
43,4,44,"For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country."
43,4,45,"So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast."
43,4,46,"Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum."
43,4,47,"When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death."
43,4,48,"Jesus therefore said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe."
43,4,49,"The nobleman said to him, Sir, come down before my child dies."
43,4,50,"Jesus said to him, Go your way. Your son lives. The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way."
43,4,51,"As he was now going down, his servants met him, saying that his son was alive."
43,4,52,"So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him."
43,4,53,"So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. He believed, as did his whole house."
43,4,54,"This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee."
43,5,1,"After these things, there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
43,5,2,"Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches."
43,5,3,"In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed [waiting for the moving of the water;"
43,5,4,"for an angel of the LORD went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.]"
43,5,5,"A certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years."
43,5,6,"When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, Do you want to be made well?"
43,5,7,"The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I'm coming, another steps down before me."
43,5,8,"Jesus said to him, Arise, take up your mat, and walk."
43,5,9,"Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked.Now it was the Sabbath on that day."
43,5,10,"So the Jewish leaders said to him who was cured, It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat."
43,5,11,"He answered them, He who made me well, the same said to me, 'Take up your mat, and walk.'"
43,5,12,"Then they asked him, Who is the man who said to you to pick it up and walk?"
43,5,13,"But he who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place."
43,5,14,"Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you."
43,5,15,"The man went away, and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well."
43,5,16,"For this cause the Jewish leaders persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the Sabbath."
43,5,17,"But Jesus answered them, My Father is still working, so I am working, too."
43,5,18,"For this cause therefore the Jewish leaders sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God."
43,5,19,"Jesus therefore answered them, Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise."
43,5,20,"For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel."
43,5,21,"For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires."
43,5,22,"For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,"
43,5,23,"that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him."
43,5,24,"Truly, truly, I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life."
43,5,25,"Truly, truly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God's voice; and those who hear will live."
43,5,26,"For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself."
43,5,27,"He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man."
43,5,28,"Do not marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,"
43,5,29,"and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment."
43,5,30,"I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the One who sent me."
43,5,31,"If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid."
43,5,32,"It is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true."
43,5,33,"You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth."
43,5,34,"But the testimony which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved."
43,5,35,"He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light."
43,5,36,"But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father has sent me."
43,5,37,"The Father himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form."
43,5,38,"You do not have his word living in you; because you do not believe him whom he sent."
43,5,39,"You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me."
43,5,40,"Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life."
43,5,41,"I do not receive glory from men."
43,5,42,"But I know you, that you do not have God's love in yourselves."
43,5,43,"I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him."
43,5,44,"How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?"
43,5,45,"Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have set your hope."
43,5,46,"For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me."
43,5,47,"But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"
43,6,1,"After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias."
43,6,2,"A great multitude followed him, because they saw the signs which he did on those who were sick."
43,6,3,"Jesus went up into the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples."
43,6,4,"Now the Passover, the Jewish festival, was near."
43,6,5,"Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip, Where are we to buy bread, that these may eat?"
43,6,6,"This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do."
43,6,7,"Philip answered him, Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little."
43,6,8,"One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,"
43,6,9,"There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?"
43,6,10,"Jesus said, Have the people sit down. Now there was much grass in that place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand."
43,6,11,"Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired."
43,6,12,"When they were filled, he said to his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost."
43,6,13,"So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten."
43,6,14,"When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, This is truly the Prophet who comes into the world."
43,6,15,"Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself."
43,6,16,"When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,"
43,6,17,"and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them."
43,6,18,"The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing."
43,6,19,"When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid."
43,6,20,"But he said to them, It is I. Do not be afraid."
43,6,21,"They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going."
43,6,22,"On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except one, and that Jesus had not entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone."
43,6,23,"However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks."
43,6,24,"When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus."
43,6,25,"When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, Rabbi, when did you come here?"
43,6,26,"Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled."
43,6,27,"Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him."
43,6,28,"They said therefore to him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God?"
43,6,29,"Jesus answered them, This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent."
43,6,30,"They said therefore to him, What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do?"
43,6,31,"Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, 'He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.'"
43,6,32,"Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven."
43,6,33,"For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world."
43,6,34,"They said therefore to him, Lord, always give us this bread."
43,6,35,"Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty."
43,6,36,"But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you do not believe."
43,6,37,"All those whom the Father gives me will come to me. Him who comes to me I will in no way throw out."
43,6,38,"For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me."
43,6,39,"This is the will of him who sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day."
43,6,40,"This is the will of my Father who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."
43,6,41,"The Jewish people therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven."
43,6,42,"They said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say, 'I have come down out of heaven?'"
43,6,43,"Therefore Jesus answered them, Do not murmur among yourselves."
43,6,44,"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day."
43,6,45,"It is written in the Prophets, 'They will all be taught by God.' Therefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me."
43,6,46,"Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father."
43,6,47,"Truly, truly, I tell you, he who believes has eternal life."
43,6,48,"I am the bread of life."
43,6,49,"Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died."
43,6,50,"This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die."
43,6,51,"I am the living bread which came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."
43,6,52,"The Judeans therefore contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
43,6,53,"Jesus therefore said to them, Truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves."
43,6,54,"He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."
43,6,55,"For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed."
43,6,56,"He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him."
43,6,57,"As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me."
43,6,58,"This is the bread which came down out of heaven-not as the fathers ate, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever."
43,6,59,"He said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum."
43,6,60,"Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?"
43,6,61,"But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, Does this cause you to stumble?"
43,6,62,"Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?"
43,6,63,"It is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life."
43,6,64,"But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him."
43,6,65,"He said, For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by the Father."
43,6,66,"At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him."
43,6,67,"Jesus said therefore to the twelve, You do not also want to go away, do you?"
43,6,68,"Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life."
43,6,69,"We have come to believe and know that you are the Holy One of God."
43,6,70,"Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
43,6,71,"Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve."
43,7,1,"After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jewish leaders sought to kill him."
43,7,2,"Now the Jewish festival, the Feast of Tabernacles, was near."
43,7,3,"His brothers therefore said to him, Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do."
43,7,4,"For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world."
43,7,5,"For even his brothers did not believe in him."
43,7,6,"Jesus therefore said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready."
43,7,7,"The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil."
43,7,8,"You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled."
43,7,9,"Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee."
43,7,10,"But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret."
43,7,11,"The Jewish leaders therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?"
43,7,12,"There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, He is a good man. Others said, Not so, but he leads the multitude astray."
43,7,13,"Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jewish leaders."
43,7,14,"But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught."
43,7,15,"The Jewish leaders therefore marveled, saying, How does this man know letters, having never been educated?"
43,7,16,"Jesus therefore answered them, My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me."
43,7,17,"If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself."
43,7,18,"He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him."
43,7,19,"Did not Moses give you the Law, and yet none of you keeps the Law? Why do you seek to kill me?"
43,7,20,"The multitude answered, You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?"
43,7,21,"Jesus answered them, I did one work, and you all marvel because of it."
43,7,22,"Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy."
43,7,23,"If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the Law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?"
43,7,24,"Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment."
43,7,25,"Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?"
43,7,26,"Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Messiah?"
43,7,27,"However we know where this man comes from, but when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he comes from."
43,7,28,"Jesus therefore called out in the temple, teaching and saying, You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you do not know."
43,7,29,"I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me."
43,7,30,"They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come."
43,7,31,"But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, When the Messiah comes, he won't do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?"
43,7,32,"The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him."
43,7,33,"Then Jesus said, I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me."
43,7,34,"You will seek me, and won't find me; and where I am, you cannot come."
43,7,35,"The Jewish leaders therefore said among themselves, Where will this man go that we won't find him? Will he go to the Diaspora among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?"
43,7,36,"What is this word that he said, 'You will seek me, and won't find me; and where I am, you cannot come'?"
43,7,37,"Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!"
43,7,38,"He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water."
43,7,39,"But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified."
43,7,40,"Some of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is truly the Prophet."
43,7,41,"Others said, This is the Messiah. But some said, What, does the Messiah come out of Galilee?"
43,7,42,"Hasn't the Scripture said that the Messiah comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"
43,7,43,"So there arose a division in the multitude because of him."
43,7,44,"Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him."
43,7,45,"The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, Why did you not bring him?"
43,7,46,"The officers answered, No man ever spoke like this man!"
43,7,47,"The Pharisees therefore answered them, You are not also led astray, are you?"
43,7,48,"Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?"
43,7,49,"But this multitude that does not know the Law is accursed."
43,7,50,"Nicodemus (he who came to him before, being one of them) said to them,"
43,7,51,"Does our Law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?"
43,7,52,"They answered him, Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee."
43,7,53,"Everyone went to his own house,"
43,8,1,"but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives."
43,8,2,"Now very early in the morning, he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down, and taught them."
43,8,3,"The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the midst,"
43,8,4,"they told him, Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act."
43,8,5,"Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such. What then do you say about her?"
43,8,6,"They said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of.But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger."
43,8,7,"But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her."
43,8,8,"Again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground."
43,8,9,"They, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle."
43,8,10,"Jesus, standing up, said to her, Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?"
43,8,11,"She said, No one, Lord.Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin no more."
43,8,12,"Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life."
43,8,13,"The Pharisees therefore said to him, You testify about yourself. Your testimony is not valid."
43,8,14,"Jesus answered them, Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you do not know where I came from, or where I am going."
43,8,15,"You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one."
43,8,16,"Even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me."
43,8,17,"It's also written in your Law that the testimony of two people is valid."
43,8,18,"I am one who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me."
43,8,19,"They said therefore to him, Where is your Father?Jesus answered, You know neither me, nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also."
43,8,20,"Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come."
43,8,21,"Jesus said therefore again to them, I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I go, you cannot come."
43,8,22,"The Jewish leaders therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come?'"
43,8,23,"He said to them, You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world."
43,8,24,"I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins."
43,8,25,"They said therefore to him, Who are you?Jesus said to them, Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning."
43,8,26,"I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the world."
43,8,27,"They did not understand that he spoke to them about the Father."
43,8,28,"Jesus therefore said to them, When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I say these things."
43,8,29,"He who sent me is with me. The Father hasn't left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him."
43,8,30,"As he spoke these things, many believed in him."
43,8,31,"Jesus therefore said to those Judeans who had believed him, If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples."
43,8,32,"You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free."
43,8,33,"They answered him, We are Abraham's seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can you say, 'You will be made free?'"
43,8,34,"Jesus answered them, Truly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin."
43,8,35,"A bondservant does not live in the house forever. A son remains forever."
43,8,36,"If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed."
43,8,37,"I know that you are Abraham's seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you."
43,8,38,"I say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have heard from your father."
43,8,39,"They answered him, Our father is Abraham.Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham."
43,8,40,"But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this."
43,8,41,"You do the works of your father.They said to him, We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father, God."
43,8,42,"Therefore Jesus said to them, If God were your father, you would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I have not come of myself, but he sent me."
43,8,43,"Why do you not understand my speech? Because you cannot hear my word."
43,8,44,"You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and its father."
43,8,45,"But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me."
43,8,46,"Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?"
43,8,47,"He who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you do not hear, because you are not of God."
43,8,48,"Then the Judeans answered him, Do not we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?"
43,8,49,"Jesus answered, I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me."
43,8,50,"But I do not seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges."
43,8,51,"Truly, truly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death."
43,8,52,"Then the Judeans said to him, Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, 'If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.'"
43,8,53,"Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?"
43,8,54,"Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say 'He is our God.'"
43,8,55,"You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, 'I do not know him,' I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word."
43,8,56,"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad."
43,8,57,"The Judeans therefore said to him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?"
43,8,58,"Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM."
43,8,59,"Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple."
43,9,1,"As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth."
43,9,2,"His disciples asked him, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"
43,9,3,"Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him."
43,9,4,"I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work."
43,9,5,"While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
43,9,6,"When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man's eyes with the mud,"
43,9,7,"and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which means Sent). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing."
43,9,8,"The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was a beggar before, said, Is not this he who sat and begged?"
43,9,9,"Some said, It is he. Others said, He looks like him.He said, I am he."
43,9,10,"They therefore were asking him, How were your eyes opened?"
43,9,11,"He answered, A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to Siloam, and wash.' So I went away and washed, and I received sight."
43,9,12,"Then they asked him, Where is he?He said, I do not know."
43,9,13,"They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees."
43,9,14,"Now it was a Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes."
43,9,15,"Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see."
43,9,16,"Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he does not keep the Sabbath. Others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? There was division among them."
43,9,17,"Therefore they asked the blind man again, What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?He said, He is a prophet."
43,9,18,"The Jewish leaders therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,"
43,9,19,"and asked them, Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"
43,9,20,"His parents answered them, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;"
43,9,21,"but how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself."
43,9,22,"His parents said these things because they feared the Jewish leaders; for the Jewish leaders had already agreed that if any man would confess him as the Messiah, he would be put out of the synagogue."
43,9,23,"Therefore his parents said, He is of age. Ask him."
43,9,24,"So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner."
43,9,25,"He therefore answered, I do not know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see."
43,9,26,"They said to him, What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"
43,9,27,"He answered them, I told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You do not also want to become his disciples, do you?"
43,9,28,"They insulted him and said, You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses."
43,9,29,"We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we do not know where he comes from."
43,9,30,"The man answered them, How amazing! You do not know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes."
43,9,31,"We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and does his will, he listens to him."
43,9,32,"Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind."
43,9,33,"If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."
43,9,34,"They answered him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? They threw him out."
43,9,35,"Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
43,9,36,"He answered, Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?"
43,9,37,"Jesus said to him, You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you."
43,9,38,"He said, Lord, I believe! and he worshiped him."
43,9,39,"Jesus said, I came into this world for judgment, that those who do not see may see; and that those who see may become blind."
43,9,40,"Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, Are we also blind?"
43,9,41,"Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would have no sin; but since you say, 'We see,' your sin remains."
43,10,1,"Truly, truly, I tell you, one who does not enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber."
43,10,2,"But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep."
43,10,3,"The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out."
43,10,4,"Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice."
43,10,5,"They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they do not know the voice of strangers."
43,10,6,"Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they did not understand what he was telling them."
43,10,7,"Jesus therefore said to them again, Truly, truly, I tell you, I am the sheep's door."
43,10,8,"All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them."
43,10,9,"I am the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture."
43,10,10,"The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly."
43,10,11,"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep."
43,10,12,"He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them."
43,10,13,"The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and does not care for the sheep."
43,10,14,"I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and my own know me;"
43,10,15,"even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep."
43,10,16,"I have other sheep, which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd."
43,10,17,"Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again."
43,10,18,"No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father."
43,10,19,"Therefore a division arose again among the Jewish people because of these words."
43,10,20,"Many of them said, He has a demon, and is insane! Why do you listen to him?"
43,10,21,"Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It is not possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind, is it?"
43,10,22,"It was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem."
43,10,23,"It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon's porch."
43,10,24,"The Jewish leaders therefore came around him and said to him, How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly."
43,10,25,"Jesus answered them, I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, these testify about me."
43,10,26,"But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep."
43,10,27,"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me."
43,10,28,"I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand."
43,10,29,"My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand."
43,10,30,"I and the Father are one."
43,10,31,"Therefore the Jewish leaders took up stones again to stone him."
43,10,32,"Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of those works do you stone me?"
43,10,33,"The Jewish leaders answered him, We do not stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because you, being a man, make yourself God."
43,10,34,"Jesus answered them, Is not it written in your law, 'I said, you are gods?'"
43,10,35,"If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),"
43,10,36,"do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You blaspheme,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God?'"
43,10,37,"If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe me."
43,10,38,"But if I do them, though you do not believe me, believe the works; that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."
43,10,39,"They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand."
43,10,40,"He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first, and there he stayed."
43,10,41,"Many came to him. They said, John indeed did no sign, but everything that John said about this man is true."
43,10,42,"And many believed in him there."
43,11,1,"Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha."
43,11,2,"It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother, Lazarus, was sick."
43,11,3,"The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick."
43,11,4,"But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God's Son may be glorified by it."
43,11,5,"Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus."
43,11,6,"When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was."
43,11,7,"Then after this he said to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again."
43,11,8,"The disciples told him, Rabbi, the Jewish leaders were just trying to stone you, and are you going there again?"
43,11,9,"Jesus answered, Are not there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world."
43,11,10,"But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."
43,11,11,"He said these things, and after that, he said to them, Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep."
43,11,12,"The disciples said to him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."
43,11,13,"Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep."
43,11,14,"So Jesus said to them plainly then, Lazarus is dead."
43,11,15,"I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let us go to him."
43,11,16,"Thomas therefore, who is called The Twin, said to his fellow disciples, Let us go also, that we may die with him."
43,11,17,"So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already."
43,11,18,"Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away."
43,11,19,"Many of the Judeans had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother."
43,11,20,"Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house."
43,11,21,"Therefore Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you would have been here, my brother would not have died."
43,11,22,"Even now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you."
43,11,23,"Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again."
43,11,24,"Martha said to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
43,11,25,"Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will still live, even if he dies."
43,11,26,"Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"
43,11,27,"She said to him, Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Messiah, God's Son, he who comes into the world."
43,11,28,"When she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and is calling you."
43,11,29,"When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him."
43,11,30,"Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him."
43,11,31,"Then the Judeans who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there."
43,11,32,"Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you would have been here, my brother would not have died."
43,11,33,"When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Judeans weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,"
43,11,34,"and said, Where have you put him?They told him, Lord, come and see."
43,11,35,"Jesus wept."
43,11,36,"The Judeans therefore said, See how much affection he had for him!"
43,11,37,"Some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?"
43,11,38,"Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it."
43,11,39,"Jesus said, Take away the stone.Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days."
43,11,40,"Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see God's glory?"
43,11,41,"So they took away the stone. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you listened to me."
43,11,42,"I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude that stands around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me."
43,11,43,"When he had said this, he shouted with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out!"
43,11,44,"He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.Jesus said to them, Free him, and let him go."
43,11,45,"Therefore many of the Judeans, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him."
43,11,46,"But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done."
43,11,47,"The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What are we doing? For this man does many signs."
43,11,48,"If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."
43,11,49,"But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, You know nothing at all,"
43,11,50,"nor do you consider that it is advantageous for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish."
43,11,51,"Now he did not say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,"
43,11,52,"and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad."
43,11,53,"So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death."
43,11,54,"Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Judeans, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples."
43,11,55,"Now the Jewish Passover was near, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves."
43,11,56,"Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, What do you think-that he is not coming to the feast at all?"
43,11,57,"Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him."
43,12,1,"Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom he raised from the dead."
43,12,2,"So they made him a supper there. Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him."
43,12,3,"Mary, therefore, took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment."
43,12,4,"Then Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,"
43,12,5,"Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?"
43,12,6,"Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it."
43,12,7,"But Jesus said, Leave her alone, that she may keep this for the day of my burial."
43,12,8,"For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me."
43,12,9,"A large crowd therefore of the Judeans learned that he was there, and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead."
43,12,10,"But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,"
43,12,11,"because on account of him many of the Jewish people went away and believed in Jesus."
43,12,12,"On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,"
43,12,13,"they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, and were shouting, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the"
43,12,14,"Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written,"
43,12,15,"Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion. Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey's colt."
43,12,16,"His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him."
43,12,17,"The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, was testifying about it."
43,12,18,"For this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign."
43,12,19,"The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him."
43,12,20,"Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast."
43,12,21,"These, therefore, came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we want to see Jesus."
43,12,22,"Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus."
43,12,23,"Jesus answered them, The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified."
43,12,24,"Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit."
43,12,25,"He who loves his life loses it. He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life."
43,12,26,"If anyone serves me, let him follow me. Where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him."
43,12,27,"Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say? 'Father, save me from this time?' But for this cause I came to this time."
43,12,28,"Father, glorify your name!Then there came a voice out of the sky, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."
43,12,29,"The multitude therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it had thundered. Others said, An angel has spoken to him."
43,12,30,"Jesus answered, This voice hasn't come for my sake, but for your sakes."
43,12,31,"Now is the judgment of this world. Now the prince of this world will be cast out."
43,12,32,"And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw everyone to myself."
43,12,33,"But he said this, signifying by what kind of death he should die."
43,12,34,"The multitude answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Messiah remains forever. How can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up?' Who is this Son of Man?"
43,12,35,"Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going."
43,12,36,"While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become children of light. Jesus said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them."
43,12,37,"But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him,"
43,12,38,"that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke,"
43,12,39,"For this cause they could not believe, for Isaiah said again,"
43,12,40,"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart,lest they should see with their eyes,and perceive with their heart,and would turn,and I would heal them."
43,12,41,"Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke of him."
43,12,42,"Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue,"
43,12,43,"for they loved men's praise more than God's praise."
43,12,44,"Jesus shouted out and said, Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me."
43,12,45,"He who sees me sees him who sent me."
43,12,46,"I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness."
43,12,47,"If anyone listens to my sayings, and does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world."
43,12,48,"He who rejects me, and does not receive my sayings, has one who judges him. The word that I spoke, the same will judge him in the last day."
43,12,49,"For I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak."
43,12,50,"I know that his commandment is eternal life. The things therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to me, so I speak."
43,13,1,"Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end."
43,13,2,"During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,"
43,13,3,"Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and was going to God,"
43,13,4,"arose from supper, and laid aside his outer garments. He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around his waist."
43,13,5,"Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him."
43,13,6,"Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet?"
43,13,7,"Jesus answered him, You do not know what I am doing now, but you will understand later."
43,13,8,"Peter said to him, You will never wash my feet!Jesus answered him, If I do not wash you, you have no part with me."
43,13,9,"Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!"
43,13,10,"Jesus said to him, Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of you."
43,13,11,"For he knew him who would betray him, therefore he said, You are not all clean."
43,13,12,"So when he had washed their feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?"
43,13,13,"You call me, 'Teacher' and 'Lord.' You say so correctly, for so I am."
43,13,14,"If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet."
43,13,15,"For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you."
43,13,16,"Truly, truly, I tell you, a servant is not greater than his lord, neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him."
43,13,17,"If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them."
43,13,18,"I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'He who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.'"
43,13,19,"From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that I am he."
43,13,20,"Truly, truly, I tell you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me."
43,13,21,"When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, Truly, truly, I tell you that one of you will betray me."
43,13,22,"The disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke."
43,13,23,"One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was at the table, leaning against Jesus' breast."
43,13,24,"Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him, Tell us who it is of whom he speaks."
43,13,25,"He, leaning back, as he was, on Jesus' breast, asked him, Lord, who is it?"
43,13,26,"Jesus therefore answered, It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it. So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot."
43,13,27,"After the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him.Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly."
43,13,28,"Now no man at the table knew why he said this to him."
43,13,29,"For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we need for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor."
43,13,30,"Therefore, having received that morsel, he went out immediately. It was night."
43,13,31,"When he had gone out, Jesus said, Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him."
43,13,32,"If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately."
43,13,33,"Little children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jewish leaders, 'Where I am going, you cannot come,' so now I tell you."
43,13,34,"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also must love one another."
43,13,35,"By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."
43,13,36,"Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where are you going?Jesus answered, Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow afterwards."
43,13,37,"Peter said to him, Lord, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."
43,13,38,"Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I tell you, the rooster won't crow until you have denied me three times."
43,14,1,"Do not let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me."
43,14,2,"In my Father's house are many dwelling places. If it weren't so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you."
43,14,3,"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also."
43,14,4,"Where I go, you know the way."
43,14,5,"Thomas said to him, Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?"
43,14,6,"Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me."
43,14,7,"If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen him."
43,14,8,"Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us."
43,14,9,"Jesus said to him, Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father?'"
43,14,10,"Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works."
43,14,11,"Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works' sake."
43,14,12,"Truly, truly, I tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater works than these, because I am going to the Father."
43,14,13,"Whatever you will ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
43,14,14,"If you will ask anything in my name, I will do it."
43,14,15,"If you love me, you will keep my commandments."
43,14,16,"I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, that he may be with you forever,-"
43,14,17,"the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive; for it does not see him, neither knows him. You know him, for he lives with you, and will be in you."
43,14,18,"I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you."
43,14,19,"Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also."
43,14,20,"In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you."
43,14,21,"One who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one who loves me. One who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to him."
43,14,22,"Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?"
43,14,23,"Jesus answered him, If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him."
43,14,24,"He who does not love me does not keep my words. The word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me."
43,14,25,"I have said these things to you, while still living with you."
43,14,26,"But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and will remind you of all that I said to you."
43,14,27,"Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."
43,14,28,"You heard how I told you, 'I go away, and I come to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to the Father; for the Father is greater than I."
43,14,29,"Now I have told you before it happens so that, when it happens, you may believe."
43,14,30,"I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me."
43,14,31,"But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here."
43,15,1,"I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer."
43,15,2,"Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit."
43,15,3,"You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you."
43,15,4,"Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me."
43,15,5,"I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing."
43,15,6,"If a man does not remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned."
43,15,7,"If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you."
43,15,8,"In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples."
43,15,9,"Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love."
43,15,10,"If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and remain in his love."
43,15,11,"I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full."
43,15,12,"This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you."
43,15,13,"Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends."
43,15,14,"You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you."
43,15,15,"No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you."
43,15,16,"You did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you."
43,15,17,"I command these things to you, that you may love one another."
43,15,18,"If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you."
43,15,19,"If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you."
43,15,20,"Remember the word that I said to you: 'A servant is not greater than his lord.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also."
43,15,21,"But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they do not know him who sent me."
43,15,22,"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin."
43,15,23,"He who hates me, hates my Father also."
43,15,24,"If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have had sin. But now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father."
43,15,25,"But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, 'They hated me without a cause.'"
43,15,26,"When the Counselor has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me."
43,15,27,"You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning."
43,16,1,"These things have I spoken to you, so that you would not be caused to stumble."
43,16,2,"They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God."
43,16,3,"They will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me."
43,16,4,"But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you."
43,16,5,"But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'"
43,16,6,"But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart."
43,16,7,"Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counselor won't come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you."
43,16,8,"When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment;"
43,16,9,"about sin, because they do not believe in me;"
43,16,10,"about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you won't see me any more;"
43,16,11,"about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged."
43,16,12,"I have yet many things to tell you, but you cannot bear them now."
43,16,13,"However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you things that are coming."
43,16,14,"He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you."
43,16,15,"All things whatever the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes of mine, and will declare it to you."
43,16,16,"A little while, and you will no longer see me. Again a little while, and you will see me."
43,16,17,"Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, What is this that he says to us, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;' and, 'Because I go to the Father?'"
43,16,18,"They said therefore, What is this that he says, 'A little while?' We do not know what he is saying."
43,16,19,"Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?'"
43,16,20,"Truly, truly, I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy."
43,16,21,"A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she does not remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world."
43,16,22,"Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you."
43,16,23,"In that day you will ask me no questions. Truly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you."
43,16,24,"Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full."
43,16,25,"I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father."
43,16,26,"In that day you will ask in my name; and I do not say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you,"
43,16,27,"for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God."
43,16,28,"I came out from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father."
43,16,29,"His disciples said to him, Behold, now you speak plainly, and speak no figures of speech."
43,16,30,"Now we know that you know all things, and do not need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came forth from God."
43,16,31,"Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?"
43,16,32,"Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me."
43,16,33,"I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world."
43,17,1,"Jesus said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you;"
43,17,2,"even as you gave him authority over all flesh, he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him."
43,17,3,"This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ."
43,17,4,"I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do."
43,17,5,"Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed."
43,17,6,"I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word."
43,17,7,"Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,"
43,17,8,"for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came forth from you, and they have believed that you sent me."
43,17,9,"I pray for them. I do not pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours."
43,17,10,"All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them."
43,17,11,"I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are."
43,17,12,"While I was with them, I kept them in your name which you have given me; I have kept. None of them is lost, except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled."
43,17,13,"But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves."
43,17,14,"I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
43,17,15,"I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one."
43,17,16,"They are not of the world even as I am not of the world."
43,17,17,"Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth."
43,17,18,"As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world."
43,17,19,"For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth."
43,17,20,"Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who believe in me through their word,"
43,17,21,"that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us; that the world may believe that you sent me."
43,17,22,"The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;"
43,17,23,"I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me."
43,17,24,"Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world."
43,17,25,"Righteous Father, the world hasn't known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me."
43,17,26,"I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them."
43,18,1,"When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered."
43,18,2,"Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples."
43,18,3,"Judas then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons."
43,18,4,"Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were happening to him, went forth, and said to them, Who are you looking for?"
43,18,5,"They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth.Jesus said to them, I AM.Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them."
43,18,6,"When therefore he said to them, I AM, they went backward, and fell to the ground."
43,18,7,"Again therefore he asked them, Who are you looking for?They said, Jesus of Nazareth."
43,18,8,"Jesus answered, I told you that I AM. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way,"
43,18,9,"that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, Of those whom you have given me, I have lost none."
43,18,10,"Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus."
43,18,11,"Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not surely drink it?"
43,18,12,"So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jewish leaders, seized Jesus and bound him,"
43,18,13,"and led him to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year."
43,18,14,"Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jewish leaders that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people."
43,18,15,"Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;"
43,18,16,"but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter."
43,18,17,"Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, Are you also one of this man's disciples?He said, I am not."
43,18,18,"Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself."
43,18,19,"The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching."
43,18,20,"Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jewish people come together. I said nothing in secret."
43,18,21,"Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these know the things which I said."
43,18,22,"When he had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand, saying, Do you answer the high priest like that?"
43,18,23,"Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you beat me?"
43,18,24,"Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest."
43,18,25,"Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, You are not also one of his disciples, are you?He denied it, and said, I am not."
43,18,26,"One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, Did not I see you in the garden with him?"
43,18,27,"Peter therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed."
43,18,28,"They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves did not enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover."
43,18,29,"Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, What accusation do you bring against this man?"
43,18,30,"They answered him, If this man weren't an evildoer, we would not have delivered him up to you."
43,18,31,"Pilate therefore said to them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.Therefore the Jewish leaders said to him, It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,"
43,18,32,"that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die."
43,18,33,"Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?"
43,18,34,"Jesus answered him, Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?"
43,18,35,"Pilate answered, I'm not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?"
43,18,36,"Jesus answered, My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I would not be delivered to the Jewish leaders. But now my Kingdom is not from here."
43,18,37,"Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then?Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. For this reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice."
43,18,38,"Pilate said to him, What is truth?When he had said this, he went out again to the Jewish leaders, and said to them, I find no basis for a charge against him."
43,18,39,"But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"
43,18,40,"Then they shouted again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas! Now Barabbas was a robber."
43,19,1,"So Pilate then took Jesus, and flogged him."
43,19,2,"The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment."
43,19,3,"And they kept coming up to him and saying, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands."
43,19,4,"Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him."
43,19,5,"Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, Behold, the man!"
43,19,6,"When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, Crucify! Crucify!Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him."
43,19,7,"The Jewish leaders answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."
43,19,8,"When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid."
43,19,9,"He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no answer."
43,19,10,"Pilate therefore said to him, Are not you speaking to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?"
43,19,11,"Jesus answered, You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin."
43,19,12,"At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jewish leaders shouted, saying, If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!"
43,19,13,"When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha."
43,19,14,"Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour. He said to the Jewish leaders, Behold, your King!"
43,19,15,"They shouted, Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King?The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar!"
43,19,16,"So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus."
43,19,17,"He went out, carrying the cross himself, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,"
43,19,18,"where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle."
43,19,19,"Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
43,19,20,"Therefore many Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek."
43,19,21,"The chief priests of the Jewish people therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'he said, I am King of the Jews.'"
43,19,22,"Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written."
43,19,23,"Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout."
43,19,24,"Then they said to one another, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,They parted my garments among them.For my cloak they cast lots.Therefore the soldiers did these things."
43,19,25,"But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene."
43,19,26,"Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!"
43,19,27,"Then he said to the disciple, Behold, your mother! From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home."
43,19,28,"After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I am thirsty."
43,19,29,"Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth."
43,19,30,"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished. He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit."
43,19,31,"Therefore the Jewish leaders, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away."
43,19,32,"Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him;"
43,19,33,"but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs."
43,19,34,"However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out."
43,19,35,"He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe."
43,19,36,"For these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him will not be broken."
43,19,37,"Again another Scripture says, They will look on him whom they pierced."
43,19,38,"After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jewish leaders, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body."
43,19,39,"Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds."
43,19,40,"So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, according to Jewish burial practice."
43,19,41,"Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been placed."
43,19,42,"Then because of the Jewish Preparation Day (for the tomb was nearby) they put Jesus there."
43,20,1,"Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb."
43,20,2,"Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have put him!"
43,20,3,"Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb."
43,20,4,"They both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first."
43,20,5,"Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he did not enter in."
43,20,6,"Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,"
43,20,7,"and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself."
43,20,8,"So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed."
43,20,9,"For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead."
43,20,10,"So the disciples went away again to their own homes."
43,20,11,"But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,"
43,20,12,"and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain."
43,20,13,"They told her, Woman, why are you weeping?She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him."
43,20,14,"When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and did not know that it was Jesus."
43,20,15,"Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him away."
43,20,16,"Jesus said to her, Mary.She turned and said to him in Hebrew, Rabboni! which is to say, Teacher!"
43,20,17,"Jesus said to her, Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
43,20,18,"Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, I have seen the Lord!, and that he had said these things to her."
43,20,19,"When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked where the disciples were, for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace be to you."
43,20,20,"When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord."
43,20,21,"Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you."
43,20,22,"When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit!"
43,20,23,"Whoever's sins you forgive, they are forgiven them. Whoever's sins you retain, they have been retained."
43,20,24,"But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came."
43,20,25,"The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord!But he said to them, Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."
43,20,26,"After eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be to you."
43,20,27,"Then he said to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your hand, and put it into my side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing."
43,20,28,"Thomas answered him, My Lord and my God!"
43,20,29,"Jesus said to him, Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed."
43,20,30,"Therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;"
43,20,31,"but these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name."
43,21,1,"After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this way."
43,21,2,"Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together."
43,21,3,"Simon Peter said to them, I'm going fishing.They told him, We are also coming with you. They went out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing."
43,21,4,"But when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus."
43,21,5,"Jesus therefore said to them, Children, have you anything to eat?They answered him, No."
43,21,6,"He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.They cast it therefore, and now they weren't able to draw it in for the multitude of fish."
43,21,7,"That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It's the Lord!So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea."
43,21,8,"But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away), dragging the net full of fish."
43,21,9,"So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish placed on it, and bread."
43,21,10,"Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish which you have just caught."
43,21,11,"Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the net was not torn."
43,21,12,"Jesus said to them, Come and eat breakfast.None of the disciples dared inquire of him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord."
43,21,13,"Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise."
43,21,14,"This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead."
43,21,15,"So when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.He said to him, Feed my lambs."
43,21,16,"He said to him again a second time, Simon, son of John, do you love me?He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.He said to him, Tend my sheep."
43,21,17,"He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you have affection for me?Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, Do you have affection for me? He said to him, Lord, you know everything. You know that I have affection for you.Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep."
43,21,18,"Truly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you, and carry you where you do not want to go."
43,21,19,"Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him, Follow me."
43,21,20,"Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus' breast at the supper and asked, Lord, who is going to betray You?"
43,21,21,"Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man?"
43,21,22,"Jesus said to him, If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me."
43,21,23,"This saying therefore went out among the brothers, that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?"
43,21,24,"This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his witness is true."
43,21,25,"There are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world itself would not have room for the books that would be written."
44,1,1,"The first account I wrote, Theophilus, concerned all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,"
44,1,2,"until the day in which he was received up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen."
44,1,3,"To these he also showed himself alive after he suffered, by many proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days, and speaking about God's Kingdom."
44,1,4,"Being assembled together with them, he commanded them, Do not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which you heard from me."
44,1,5,"For John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now."
44,1,6,"Therefore, when they had come together, they asked him, Lord, are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?"
44,1,7,"He said to them, It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within his own authority."
44,1,8,"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth."
44,1,9,"When he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight."
44,1,10,"While they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white clothing,"
44,1,11,"who also said, You men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who was received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going into the sky."
44,1,12,"Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away."
44,1,13,"When they had come in, they went up into the upper room, where they were staying; that is Peter, John, Jacob, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, Jacob the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of Jacob."
44,1,14,"All these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers."
44,1,15,"In these days, Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers (and the number of names was about one hundred twenty), and said,"
44,1,16,"Brothers, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus."
44,1,17,"For he was numbered with us, and received his portion in this ministry."
44,1,18,"Now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness, and falling headlong, his body burst open, and all his intestines gushed out."
44,1,19,"It became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called 'Hakel-Dema,' that is, 'The field of blood.'"
44,1,20,"For it is written in the scroll of Psalms,'Let his habitation be made desolate.Let no one dwell therein;'and,'Let another take his office.'"
44,1,21,"Of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,"
44,1,22,"beginning from the baptism of John, to the day that he was received up from us, of these one must become a witness with us of his resurrection."
44,1,23,"They put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias."
44,1,24,"They prayed, and said, You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosen"
44,1,25,"to take part in this ministry and office of apostle from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place."
44,1,26,"They drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the Eleven apostles."
44,2,1,"Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place."
44,2,2,"Suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting."
44,2,3,"Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of them."
44,2,4,"They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak."
44,2,5,"Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under the sky."
44,2,6,"When this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in his own language."
44,2,7,"They were all amazed and marveled, saying, Behold, are not all these who speak Galileans?"
44,2,8,"How do we hear, everyone in our own native language?"
44,2,9,"Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,"
44,2,10,"Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,"
44,2,11,"Cretans and Arabians: we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of God!"
44,2,12,"They were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, What does this mean?"
44,2,13,"Others, mocking, said, They are filled with new wine."
44,2,14,"But Peter, standing up with the Eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke out to them, You men of Judea, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words."
44,2,15,"For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only the third hour of the day."
44,2,16,"But this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel:"
44,2,17,"'It will be in the last days, says God,that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh.Your sons and your daughters will prophesy.Your young men will see visions.Your old men will dream dreams."
44,2,18,"Yes, and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days,I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy."
44,2,19,"I will show wonders in the sky above,and signs on the earth beneath;blood, and fire, and billows of smoke."
44,2,20,"The sun will be turned into darkness,and the moon into blood,before the great and glorious day of the"
44,2,21,"It will be, that whoever will call on the name of the"
44,2,22,"Men of Israel, hear these words! Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as you yourselves know,"
44,2,23,"him, being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed;"
44,2,24,"whom God raised up, having freed him from the pains of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it."
44,2,25,"For David says concerning him,'I saw the"
44,2,26,"Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced.Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;"
44,2,27,"because you will not leave my soul in hell,neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay."
44,2,28,"You made known to me the ways of life.You will make me full of gladness with your presence.'"
44,2,29,"Brothers, I may tell you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day."
44,2,30,"Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that one of his descendants would sit on his throne,"
44,2,31,"he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Messiah, that neither was he left in hell, nor did his flesh see decay."
44,2,32,"This Jesus God raised up, to which we all are witnesses."
44,2,33,"Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you see and hear."
44,2,34,"For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself,'The"
44,2,35,"until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.'"
44,2,36,"Let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Messiah, this Jesus whom you crucified."
44,2,37,"Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brothers, what shall we do?"
44,2,38,"Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."
44,2,39,"For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the"
44,2,40,"With many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation!"
44,2,41,"Then those who received his word were baptized. There were added that day about three thousand souls."
44,2,42,"They continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and prayer."
44,2,43,"Fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles."
44,2,44,"All who believed were together, and had all things in common."
44,2,45,"They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need."
44,2,46,"Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,"
44,2,47,"praising God, and having favor with all the people. The Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved."
44,3,1,"Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour."
44,3,2,"A certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried, whom they put daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask gifts for the needy of those who entered into the temple."
44,3,3,"Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive gifts for the needy."
44,3,4,"Peter, fastening his eyes on him, with John, said, Look at us."
44,3,5,"He listened to them, expecting to receive something from them."
44,3,6,"But Peter said, Silver and gold have I none, but what I have, that I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!"
44,3,7,"He took him by the right hand, and raised him up. Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength."
44,3,8,"Leaping up, he stood, and began to walk. He entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God."
44,3,9,"All the people saw him walking and praising God."
44,3,10,"They recognized him, that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him."
44,3,11,"And as he held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering."
44,3,12,"When Peter saw it, he responded to the people, You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this man? Why do you fasten your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk?"
44,3,13,"The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to release him."
44,3,14,"But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a man who was a murderer to be granted to you,"
44,3,15,"and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses."
44,3,16,"By faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all."
44,3,17,"Now, brothers, I know that you did this in ignorance, as did also your rulers."
44,3,18,"But the things which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that Messiah should suffer, he thus fulfilled."
44,3,19,"Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord,"
44,3,20,"and that he may send the Messiah Jesus, who was ordained for you before,"
44,3,21,"whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God spoke long ago by the mouth of his holy prophets."
44,3,22,"For Moses indeed said to the fathers, 'The"
44,3,23,"It will be, that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.'"
44,3,24,"Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days."
44,3,25,"You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, 'In your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.'"
44,3,26,"God, having raised up his Servant, sent him to you first, to bless you, in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness."
44,4,1,"As they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them,"
44,4,2,"being upset because they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead."
44,4,3,"They laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now evening."
44,4,4,"But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to be about five thousand."
44,4,5,"It happened in the morning, that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem."
44,4,6,"Annas the high priest was there, with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were relatives of the high priest."
44,4,7,"When they had stood them in the middle of them, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"
44,4,8,"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people, and elders,"
44,4,9,"if we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,"
44,4,10,"be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in him does this man stand here before you whole."
44,4,11,"He is 'the stone which was regarded as worthless by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.'"
44,4,12,"And there is salvation in none other, for there is no other name under heaven, that is given among men by which we must be saved!"
44,4,13,"Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled. They recognized that they had been with Jesus."
44,4,14,"Seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it."
44,4,15,"But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,"
44,4,16,"saying, What shall we do to these men? Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it."
44,4,17,"But so that this spreads no further among the people, let us threaten them, that from now on they do not speak to anyone in this name."
44,4,18,"They called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus."
44,4,19,"But Peter and John answered them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves,"
44,4,20,"for we cannot help telling the things which we saw and heard."
44,4,21,"When they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for everyone glorified God for that which was done."
44,4,22,"For the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old."
44,4,23,"Being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them."
44,4,24,"When they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Master, it is you who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;"
44,4,25,"who by the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of your servant, David, said,'Why do the nations rage,and the peoples plot a vain thing?"
44,4,26,"The kings of the earth take a stand,and the rulers take council together,against the"
44,4,27,"For truly, in this city against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together"
44,4,28,"to do whatever your hand and your council foreordained to happen."
44,4,29,"Now, Lord, look at their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,"
44,4,30,"while you stretch out your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy Servant Jesus."
44,4,31,"When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were gathered together. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness."
44,4,32,"The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul. Not one of them claimed that anything of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common."
44,4,33,"With great power, the apostles gave their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Great grace was on them all."
44,4,34,"For neither was there among them any who lacked, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,"
44,4,35,"and put them at the apostles' feet, and distribution was made to each, according as anyone had need."
44,4,36,"Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,"
44,4,37,"having a field, sold it, and brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet."
44,5,1,"But a certain man named Ananias, with Sappirah, his wife, sold a possession,"
44,5,2,"and kept back part of the price, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part, and put it at the apostles' feet."
44,5,3,"But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?"
44,5,4,"While you kept it, did not it remain your own? After it was sold, was not it in your power? How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God."
44,5,5,"Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and died. Great fear came on all who heard it."
44,5,6,"The young men arose and wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him."
44,5,7,"About three hours later, his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in."
44,5,8,"Peter answered her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much.She said, Yes, for so much."
44,5,9,"But Peter asked her, How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."
44,5,10,"She fell down immediately at his feet, and died. The young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband."
44,5,11,"Great fear came on the whole church, and on all who heard these things."
44,5,12,"By the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. They were all with one accord in Solomon's porch."
44,5,13,"None of the rest dared to join them, however the people honored them."
44,5,14,"More believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women."
44,5,15,"They even carried out the sick into the streets, and put them on cots and mattresses, so that as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some of them."
44,5,16,"Multitudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those who were tormented by unclean spirits: and they were all healed."
44,5,17,"But the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,"
44,5,18,"and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public custody."
44,5,19,"But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night, and brought them out, and said,"
44,5,20,"Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."
44,5,21,"When they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, and those who were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought."
44,5,22,"But the officers who came did not find them in the prison. They returned and reported,"
44,5,23,"We found the prison shut and locked, and the guards standing before the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside!"
44,5,24,"Now when the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this."
44,5,25,"One came and told them, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people."
44,5,26,"Then the captain went with the officers, and brought them without violence, for they were afraid that the people might stone them."
44,5,27,"When they had brought them, they set them before the council. The high priest questioned them,"
44,5,28,"saying, Did not we strictly command you not to teach in this name? Behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood on us."
44,5,29,"But Peter and the apostles answered, We must obey God rather than men."
44,5,30,"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed, hanging him on a tree."
44,5,31,"God exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins."
44,5,32,"We are witnesses of these things; and so also is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."
44,5,33,"But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and wanted to kill them."
44,5,34,"But one stood up in the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, honored by all the people, and commanded to put the men out for a little while."
44,5,35,"He said to them, You men of Israel, be careful concerning these men, what you are about to do."
44,5,36,"For before these days Todah rose up, making himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nothing."
44,5,37,"After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away some people after him. He also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad."
44,5,38,"Now I tell you, withdraw from these men, and leave them alone. For if this counsel or this work is of man, it will be overthrown."
44,5,39,"But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them, and you would be found even to be fighting against God!"
44,5,40,"They agreed with him. Summoning the apostles, they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go."
44,5,41,"They therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name."
44,5,42,"Every day, in the temple and at home, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming Jesus, the Messiah."
44,6,1,"Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service."
44,6,2,"The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables."
44,6,3,"Therefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business."
44,6,4,"But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word."
44,6,5,"These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;"
44,6,6,"whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them."
44,6,7,"The word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith."
44,6,8,"Stephen, full of grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people."
44,6,9,"But some of those who were of the synagogue called The Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen."
44,6,10,"They weren't able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke."
44,6,11,"Then they secretly induced men to say, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God."
44,6,12,"They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, and brought him in to the council,"
44,6,13,"and set up false witnesses who said, This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the Law."
44,6,14,"For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us."
44,6,15,"All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel."
44,7,1,"The high priest said, Are these things so?"
44,7,2,"He said, Brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,"
44,7,3,"and said to him, 'Get out of your land, and from your relatives, and come into a land which I will show you.'"
44,7,4,"Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and lived in Haran. From there, when his father was dead, God moved him into this land, where you are now living."
44,7,5,"He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. He promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when he still had no child."
44,7,6,"God spoke in this way: that his seed would live as foreigners in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years."
44,7,7,"'I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,' said God, 'and after that will they come out, and serve me in this place.'"
44,7,8,"He gave him the covenant of circumcision. So Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs."
44,7,9,"The patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. God was with him,"
44,7,10,"and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. He made him governor over Egypt and all his house."
44,7,11,"Now a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction. Our fathers found no food."
44,7,12,"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time."
44,7,13,"On the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph's race was revealed to Pharaoh."
44,7,14,"Then Joseph sent, and summoned Jacob, his father, and all his relatives, seventy-five souls."
44,7,15,"Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, himself and our fathers,"
44,7,16,"and they were brought back to Shechem, and placed in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor in Shechem."
44,7,17,"But as the time of the promise came close which God had made to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,"
44,7,18,"until there arose a different king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph."
44,7,19,"The same took advantage of our race, and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to throw out their babies, so that they would not stay alive."
44,7,20,"At that time Moses was born, and was exceedingly handsome. He was nourished three months in his father's house."
44,7,21,"When he was thrown out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and reared him as her own son."
44,7,22,"Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. He was mighty in his words and works."
44,7,23,"But when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel."
44,7,24,"Seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, striking the Egyptian."
44,7,25,"He supposed that his brothers understood that God, by his hand, was giving them deliverance; but they did not understand."
44,7,26,"The day following, he appeared to them as they fought, and urged them to be at peace again, saying, 'Sirs, you are brothers. Why do you wrong one another?'"
44,7,27,"But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?"
44,7,28,"Do you want to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'"
44,7,29,"Moses fled at this saying, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons."
44,7,30,"When forty years were fulfilled, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush."
44,7,31,"When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight. As he came close to see, a voice of the"
44,7,32,"'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob.' Moses trembled, and dared not look."
44,7,33,"The"
44,7,34,"I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning. I have come down to deliver them. Now come, I will send you into Egypt.'"
44,7,35,"This Moses, whom they refused, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'-God has sent him as both a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush."
44,7,36,"This man led them out, having worked wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years."
44,7,37,"This is that Moses, who said to the children of Israel, 'God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me.'"
44,7,38,"This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, who received words of life to give to us,"
44,7,39,"to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but rejected him, and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,"
44,7,40,"saying to Aaron, 'Make us gods that will go before us, for as for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'"
44,7,41,"They made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands."
44,7,42,"But God turned, and abandoned them to serve the hosts of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets,'Did you offer to me slain animals and sacrificesforty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?"
44,7,43,"You took up the tabernacle of Moloch,the star of your god Rephan,the figures which you made to worship.I will carry you away beyond Babylon.'"
44,7,44,"Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to make it according to the pattern that he had seen;"
44,7,45,"which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered into the possession of the nations, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David,"
44,7,46,"who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob."
44,7,47,"But Solomon built him a house."
44,7,48,"However, the Most High does not dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophet says,"
44,7,49,"'heaven is my throne,and the earth a footstool for my feet.What kind of house will you build me?' says the"
44,7,50,"Did not my hand make all these things?'"
44,7,51,"You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit! As your fathers did, so you do."
44,7,52,"Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers."
44,7,53,"You received the Law as it was ordained by angels, and did not keep it!"
44,7,54,"Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with their teeth."
44,7,55,"But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,"
44,7,56,"and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!"
44,7,57,"But they shouted out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed at him with one accord."
44,7,58,"They threw him out of the city, and stoned him. The witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul."
44,7,59,"They stoned Stephen as he called out, saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!"
44,7,60,"He kneeled down, and shouted out, Lord, do not hold this sin against them! When he had said this, he fell asleep."
44,8,1,"Saul was consenting to his death. A great persecution arose against the church which was in Jerusalem in that day. They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles."
44,8,2,"Devout men buried Stephen, and lamented greatly over him."
44,8,3,"But Saul ravaged the church, entering into every house, and dragged both men and women off to prison."
44,8,4,"Therefore those who were scattered abroad went around proclaiming the word."
44,8,5,"Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Messiah."
44,8,6,"The multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs which he did."
44,8,7,"For unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them. They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed."
44,8,8,"There was great joy in that city."
44,8,9,"But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who used to practice sorcery in the city, and amazed the people of Samaria, making himself out to be some great one,"
44,8,10,"to whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great."
44,8,11,"They listened to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries."
44,8,12,"But when they believed Philip proclaiming good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women."
44,8,13,"Simon himself also believed. Being baptized, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles occurring, he was amazed."
44,8,14,"Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,"
44,8,15,"who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;"
44,8,16,"for as yet he had fallen on none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,8,17,"Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit."
44,8,18,"Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,"
44,8,19,"saying, Give me also this power, that whomever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit."
44,8,20,"But Peter said to him, May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!"
44,8,21,"You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God."
44,8,22,"Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask the Lord if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you."
44,8,23,"For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity."
44,8,24,"Simon answered, Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me."
44,8,25,"They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans."
44,8,26,"But an angel of the"
44,8,27,"He arose and went; and behold, there was a man from Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship."
44,8,28,"He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah."
44,8,29,"The Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and join yourself to this chariot."
44,8,30,"Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Do you understand what you are reading?"
44,8,31,"He said, How can I, unless someone explains it to me? He begged Philip to come up and sit with him."
44,8,32,"Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this,He was led as a sheep to the slaughter.As a lamb before his shearer is silent,so he does not open his mouth."
44,8,33,"In his humiliation, justice was taken away.Who will declare His generation?For his life is taken from the earth."
44,8,34,"The eunuch answered Philip, Who is the prophet talking about? About himself, or about someone else?"
44,8,35,"Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached to him Jesus."
44,8,36,"As they went on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, Behold, here is water. What is keeping me from being baptized? ["
44,8,37,"Philip said, 'If you believe with all your heart, you may.' He answered, 'I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.]"
44,8,38,"He commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him."
44,8,39,"When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him any more, for he went on his way rejoicing."
44,8,40,"But Philip was found at Azotus. Passing through, he preached the Good News to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea."
44,9,1,"But Saul, still breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,"
44,9,2,"and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem."
44,9,3,"As he traveled, it happened that he got close to Damascus, and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him."
44,9,4,"He fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"
44,9,5,"He said, Who are you, Lord?The Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting."
44,9,6,"But rise up, and enter into the city, and you will be told what you must do."
44,9,7,"The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the sound, but seeing no one."
44,9,8,"Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no one. They led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus."
44,9,9,"He was without sight for three days, and neither ate nor drank."
44,9,10,"Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias!He said, Behold, it's me, Lord."
44,9,11,"The Lord said to him, Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying,"
44,9,12,"and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight."
44,9,13,"But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he did to your saints at Jerusalem."
44,9,14,"Here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name."
44,9,15,"But the Lord said to him, Go your way, for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings, and the sons of Israel."
44,9,16,"For I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name's sake."
44,9,17,"Ananias departed, and entered into the house. Laying his hands on him, he said, Brother Saul, the Lord, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
44,9,18,"Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight. He arose and was baptized."
44,9,19,"He took food and was strengthened. He stayed several days with the disciples who were at Damascus."
44,9,20,"Immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God."
44,9,21,"All who heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this name? And he had come here intending to bring them bound before the chief priests!"
44,9,22,"But Saul increased more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, proving that this is the Messiah."
44,9,23,"When many days were fulfilled, the Jews conspired together to kill him,"
44,9,24,"but their plot became known to Saul. They watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him,"
44,9,25,"but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket."
44,9,26,"When Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple."
44,9,27,"But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus."
44,9,28,"He was with them coming in and going out in Jerusalem, proclaiming boldly in the name of the Lord."
44,9,29,"He spoke and disputed against the Hellenists, but they were seeking to kill him."
44,9,30,"When the brothers knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him off to Tarsus."
44,9,31,"So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, and were built up. They were multiplied, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit."
44,9,32,"It happened, as Peter went throughout all those parts, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda."
44,9,33,"There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, because he was paralyzed."
44,9,34,"Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed! Immediately he arose."
44,9,35,"All who lived at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord."
44,9,36,"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which when translated, means Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and acts of mercy which she did."
44,9,37,"It happened in those days that she fell sick, and died. When they had washed her, they placed her in an upper chamber."
44,9,38,"As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him not to delay in coming to us."
44,9,39,"Peter got up and went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper chamber. All the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them."
44,9,40,"Peter put them all out, and kneeled down and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, get up! She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up."
44,9,41,"He gave her his hand, and raised her up. Calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive."
44,9,42,"And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord."
44,9,43,"It happened, that he stayed many days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner."
44,10,1,"Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,"
44,10,2,"a devout man, and one who feared God with all his house, who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people, and always prayed to God."
44,10,3,"At about the ninth hour of the day, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him, and saying to him, Cornelius!"
44,10,4,"He, fastening his eyes on him, and being frightened, said, What is it, Lord?He said to him, Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone up for a memorial before God."
44,10,5,"Now send men to Joppa, and get Simon, who is surnamed Peter."
44,10,6,"He lodges with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside."
44,10,7,"When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually."
44,10,8,"Having explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa."
44,10,9,"Now on the next day as they were on their journey, and got close to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon."
44,10,10,"He became hungry and desired to eat, but while they were preparing, he fell into a trance."
44,10,11,"He saw heaven opened and a certain container descending to him, like a great sheet let down by four corners on the earth,"
44,10,12,"in which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the sky."
44,10,13,"A voice came to him, Rise, Peter, kill and eat!"
44,10,14,"But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean."
44,10,15,"A voice came to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, you must not call unclean."
44,10,16,"This was done three times, and immediately the vessel was received up into heaven."
44,10,17,"Now while Peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate,"
44,10,18,"and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, was lodging there."
44,10,19,"While Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek you."
44,10,20,"But arise, get down, and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them."
44,10,21,"Peter went down to the men, and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek. Why have you come?"
44,10,22,"They said, Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God, and well spoken of by all the Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house, and to listen to what you say."
44,10,23,"So he called them in and lodged them. On the next day he arose and went out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him."
44,10,24,"On the next day they entered into Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and his near friends."
44,10,25,"When it happened that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped him."
44,10,26,"But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up! I myself am also a man."
44,10,27,"And as he talked with him, he went in and found many gathered together."
44,10,28,"He said to them, You yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to join himself or come to one of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean."
44,10,29,"Therefore also I came without complaint when I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for me?"
44,10,30,"Cornelius said, Four days ago until this hour, the ninth hour, I was praying in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,"
44,10,31,"and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of God."
44,10,32,"Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter. He lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the seaside.'"
44,10,33,"Therefore I sent to you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by the Lord."
44,10,34,"And Peter opened his mouth and said, Truly I perceive that God does not show favoritism;"
44,10,35,"but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him."
44,10,36,"The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming good news of peace by Jesus Christ-he is Lord of all-"
44,10,37,"that spoken word you yourselves know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;"
44,10,38,"even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him."
44,10,39,"We are witnesses of everything he did both in the countryside of Judea, and in Jerusalem; whom they also killed, hanging him on a tree."
44,10,40,"God raised him up the third day, and gave him to be revealed,"
44,10,41,"not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead."
44,10,42,"He commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead."
44,10,43,"All the prophets testify about him, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins."
44,10,44,"While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word."
44,10,45,"They of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles."
44,10,46,"For they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God.Then Peter answered,"
44,10,47,"Can any man forbid the water, that these who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be baptized?"
44,10,48,"He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay some days."
44,11,1,"Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God."
44,11,2,"When Peter had come up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him,"
44,11,3,"saying, You went in to uncircumcised men, and ate with them!"
44,11,4,"But Peter began, and explained to them in order, saying,"
44,11,5,"I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain container descending, like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners. It came as far as me."
44,11,6,"When I had looked intently at it, I considered, and saw the four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky."
44,11,7,"I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter, kill and eat!'"
44,11,8,"But I said, 'Not so, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.'"
44,11,9,"But a voice answered the second time out of heaven, 'What God has cleansed, do not call unclean.'"
44,11,10,"This was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven."
44,11,11,"Behold, immediately three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me."
44,11,12,"The Spirit told me to go with them, without discriminating. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house."
44,11,13,"He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying to him, 'Send to Joppa, and get Simon, whose surname is Peter,"
44,11,14,"who will speak to you words by which you will be saved, you and all your house.'"
44,11,15,"As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning."
44,11,16,"I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, 'John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.'"
44,11,17,"If then God gave to them the same gift as us, when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?"
44,11,18,"When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life!"
44,11,19,"They therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews only."
44,11,20,"But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, proclaiming the Lord Jesus."
44,11,21,"The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord."
44,11,22,"The report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem. They sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch,"
44,11,23,"who, when he had come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad. He exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they should remain near to the Lord."
44,11,24,"For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Lord."
44,11,25,"Barnabas went out to Tarsus to look for Saul."
44,11,26,"When he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. It happened, that for a whole year they were gathered together with the church, and taught many people. The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch."
44,11,27,"Now in these days, prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch."
44,11,28,"One of them named Agabus stood up, and indicated by the Spirit that there should be a great famine all over the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius."
44,11,29,"As any of the disciples had plenty, each determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea;"
44,11,30,"which they also did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul."
44,12,1,"Now about that time, Herod the king stretched out his hands to oppress some of the church."
44,12,2,"He killed Jacob, the brother of John, with the sword."
44,12,3,"When he saw that it pleased the Jewish people, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This was during the days of unleavened bread."
44,12,4,"When he had arrested him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover."
44,12,5,"Peter therefore was kept in the prison, but constant prayer was made by the church to God for him."
44,12,6,"The same night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. Guards in front of the door kept the prison."
44,12,7,"And behold, an angel of the"
44,12,8,"The angel said to him, Get dressed and put on your sandals. He did so. He said to him, Put on your cloak, and follow me."
44,12,9,"And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he saw a vision."
44,12,10,"When they were past the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened to them by itself. They went out, and went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him."
44,12,11,"When Peter had come to himself, he said, Now I truly know that the Lord has sent out his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from everything the Jewish people were expecting."
44,12,12,"Thinking about that, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying."
44,12,13,"When Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer."
44,12,14,"When she recognized Peter's voice, she did not open the gate for joy, but ran in, and reported that Peter was standing in front of the gate."
44,12,15,"They said to her, You are crazy! But she insisted that it was so. They said, It is his angel."
44,12,16,"But Peter continued knocking. When they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed."
44,12,17,"But he, beckoning to them with his hand to be silent, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, Tell these things to Jacob, and to the brothers. Then he departed, and went to another place."
44,12,18,"Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter."
44,12,19,"When Herod had sought for him, and did not find him, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. He went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there."
44,12,20,"Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus, the king's personal aide, their friend, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food."
44,12,21,"On an appointed day, Herod dressed himself in royal clothing, sat on the throne, and gave a speech to them."
44,12,22,"The people shouted, The voice of a god, and not of a man!"
44,12,23,"Immediately an angel of the"
44,12,24,"But the word of God grew and multiplied."
44,12,25,"Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their service, also taking with them John whose surname was Mark."
44,13,1,"Now in the church that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul."
44,13,2,"As they served the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate Barnabas and Saul for me, for the work to which I have called them."
44,13,3,"Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away."
44,13,4,"So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus."
44,13,5,"When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. They had also John as their attendant."
44,13,6,"When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-Jesus,"
44,13,7,"who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God."
44,13,8,"But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith."
44,13,9,"But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,"
44,13,10,"and said, Full of all deceit and all cunning, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?"
44,13,11,"Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him. He went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand."
44,13,12,"Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord."
44,13,13,"Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem."
44,13,14,"But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down."
44,13,15,"After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak."
44,13,16,"Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen."
44,13,17,"The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they stayed as foreigners in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led them out of it."
44,13,18,"For a period of about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness."
44,13,19,"When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance"
44,13,20,"for about four hundred fifty years. After these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet."
44,13,21,"Afterward they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years."
44,13,22,"When he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, to whom he also testified, 'I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.'"
44,13,23,"From this man's seed, according to his promise, God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus,"
44,13,24,"before his coming, when John had first preached the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel."
44,13,25,"As John was fulfilling his course, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. But behold, one comes after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'"
44,13,26,"Brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, the word of this salvation is sent out to us."
44,13,27,"For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not know him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him."
44,13,28,"Though they found no cause for death, they still asked Pilate to have him killed."
44,13,29,"When they had fulfilled all things that were written about him, they took him down from the tree, and placed him in a tomb."
44,13,30,"But God raised him from the dead,"
44,13,31,"and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people."
44,13,32,"We bring you good news of the promise made to the fathers,"
44,13,33,"that God has fulfilled the same to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second psalm,'You are my Son.Today I have become your father.'"
44,13,34,"Concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he has spoken thus: 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'"
44,13,35,"Therefore he says also in another psalm, 'You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.'"
44,13,36,"For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was placed with his fathers, and saw decay."
44,13,37,"But he whom God raised up saw no decay."
44,13,38,"Be it known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins,"
44,13,39,"and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the Law of Moses."
44,13,40,"Beware therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken in the Prophets:"
44,13,41,"'Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish;for I work a work in your days,a work which you will in no way believe, if one declares it to you.'"
44,13,42,"So when they went out they begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath."
44,13,43,"Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God."
44,13,44,"The next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of the Lord."
44,13,45,"But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed."
44,13,46,"Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, It was necessary that God's word should be spoken to you first. Since indeed you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles."
44,13,47,"For so has the"
44,13,48,"As the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God. As many as were appointed to eternal life believed."
44,13,49,"The Lord's word was spread abroad throughout all the region."
44,13,50,"But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their borders."
44,13,51,"But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium."
44,13,52,"The disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit."
44,14,1,"It happened in Iconium that they entered together into the Jewish synagogue, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed."
44,14,2,"But the disbelieving Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers."
44,14,3,"Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands."
44,14,4,"But the multitude of the city was divided. Part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles."
44,14,5,"When some of both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them,"
44,14,6,"they became aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the surrounding region."
44,14,7,"There they preached the Good News."
44,14,8,"At Lystra a certain man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked."
44,14,9,"He was listening to Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,"
44,14,10,"said with a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet! He leaped up and walked."
44,14,11,"When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia, The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!"
44,14,12,"They called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury, because he was the chief speaker."
44,14,13,"The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes."
44,14,14,"But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and sprang into the multitude, crying out,"
44,14,15,"Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the sky and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;"
44,14,16,"who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways."
44,14,17,"Yet he did not leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness."
44,14,18,"Even saying these things, they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them."
44,14,19,"But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead."
44,14,20,"But as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city. On the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe."
44,14,21,"When they had preached the Good News to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,"
44,14,22,"confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of God."
44,14,23,"When they had appointed elders for them in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed."
44,14,24,"They passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia."
44,14,25,"When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia."
44,14,26,"From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled."
44,14,27,"When they had arrived, and had gathered the church together, they reported all the things that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations."
44,14,28,"They stayed there with the disciples for a long time."
44,15,1,"Some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers, Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."
44,15,2,"Therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small discord and discussion with them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas, and some others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question."
44,15,3,"They, being sent on their way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles. They caused great joy to all the brothers."
44,15,4,"When they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all things that God had done with them."
44,15,5,"But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the Law of Moses."
44,15,6,"The apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter."
44,15,7,"When there had been much discussion, Peter rose up and said to them, Brothers, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the nations should hear the word of the Good News, and believe."
44,15,8,"God, who knows the heart, testified about them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just like he did to us."
44,15,9,"He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith."
44,15,10,"Now therefore why do you tempt God, that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"
44,15,11,"But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they are."
44,15,12,"All the multitude kept silence, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul reporting what signs and wonders God had done among the nations through them."
44,15,13,"After they were silent, Jacob answered, Brothers, listen to me."
44,15,14,"Simeon has reported how God first visited the nations, to take out of them a people for his name."
44,15,15,"This agrees with the words of the prophets. As it is written,"
44,15,16,"'After these things I will return.I will again build the tabernacle of David, which has fallen.I will again build its ruins.I will set it up,"
44,15,17,"That the rest of men may seek after the Lord;All the Gentiles who are called by my name,'Says the"
44,15,18,"known from of old."
44,15,19,"Therefore my judgment is that we do not trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn to God,"
44,15,20,"but that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood."
44,15,21,"For Moses from generations of old has in every city those who proclaim him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath."
44,15,22,"Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brothers."
44,15,23,"They wrote these things by their hand:The apostles, the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: greetings."
44,15,24,"Because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, to whom we gave no commandment;"
44,15,25,"it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,"
44,15,26,"men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
44,15,27,"We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth."
44,15,28,"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things:"
44,15,29,"that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality, from which if you keep yourselves, it will be well with you. Farewell."
44,15,30,"So, when they were sent off, they came to Antioch. Having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter."
44,15,31,"When they had read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement."
44,15,32,"Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers with many words, and strengthened them."
44,15,33,"After they had spent some time there, they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to those that had sent them forth."
44,15,35,"But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord, with many others also."
44,15,36,"After some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing."
44,15,37,"Barnabas planned to take John, who was called Mark, with them also."
44,15,38,"But Paul did not think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia, and did not go with them to do the work."
44,15,39,"Then the contention grew so sharp that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away to Cyprus,"
44,15,40,"but Paul chose Silas, and went out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord."
44,15,41,"He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches."
44,16,1,"He came to Derbe and Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess who believed; but his father was a Greek."
44,16,2,"The brothers who were at Lystra and Iconium gave a good testimony about him."
44,16,3,"Paul wanted to have him go out with him, and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts; for they all knew that his father was a Greek."
44,16,4,"As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem."
44,16,5,"So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily."
44,16,6,"When they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia."
44,16,7,"When they had come opposite Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them."
44,16,8,"Passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas."
44,16,9,"A vision appeared to Paul in the night. There was a man of Macedonia standing, begging him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us."
44,16,10,"When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to proclaim the Good News to them."
44,16,11,"Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;"
44,16,12,"and from there to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the foremost of the district, a Roman colony. We were staying some days in this city."
44,16,13,"On the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the gate by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had come together."
44,16,14,"A certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who worshiped God, heard us; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul."
44,16,15,"When she and her household were baptized, she begged us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and stay. So she persuaded us."
44,16,16,"It happened, as we were going to prayer, that a certain girl having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling."
44,16,17,"She followed Paul and us, shouting, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation!"
44,16,18,"She was doing this for many days.But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her! It came out that very hour."
44,16,19,"But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers."
44,16,20,"When they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, are agitating our city,"
44,16,21,"and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans."
44,16,22,"The multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them, and commanded them to be beaten with rods."
44,16,23,"When they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely,"
44,16,24,"who, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks."
44,16,25,"But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them."
44,16,26,"Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were loosened."
44,16,27,"The jailer, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped."
44,16,28,"But Paul shouted loudly, saying, Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!"
44,16,29,"He called for lights and sprang in, and, fell down trembling before Paul and Silas,"
44,16,30,"and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
44,16,31,"They said, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household."
44,16,32,"They spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his house."
44,16,33,"He took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized, he and all his household."
44,16,34,"He brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his household, having believed in God."
44,16,35,"But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go."
44,16,36,"The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out, and go in peace."
44,16,37,"But Paul said to them, They have beaten us publicly, without a trial, men who are Romans, and have cast us into prison! Do they now release us secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and bring us out!"
44,16,38,"The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,"
44,16,39,"and they came and begged them. When they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city."
44,16,40,"They went out of the prison, and entered into Lydia's house. When they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them, and departed."
44,17,1,"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue."
44,17,2,"Paul, as was his custom, went in to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,"
44,17,3,"explaining and demonstrating that the Messiah had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Messiah."
44,17,4,"Some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas, of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the chief women."
44,17,5,"But the Jews, being moved with jealousy,  took along some wicked men from the marketplace, and gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people."
44,17,6,"When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and certain brothers before the rulers of the city, crying, These who have turned the world upside down have come here also,"
44,17,7,"whom Jason has received. These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus!"
44,17,8,"The multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things."
44,17,9,"When they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go."
44,17,10,"The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue."
44,17,11,"Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so."
44,17,12,"Many of them therefore believed; also of the prominent Greek women, and not a few men."
44,17,13,"But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also, they came there likewise, agitating the multitudes."
44,17,14,"Then the brothers immediately sent out Paul to go as far as to the sea, and Silas and Timothy still stayed there."
44,17,15,"But those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens. Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him very quickly, they departed."
44,17,16,"Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols."
44,17,17,"So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who met him."
44,17,18,"Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also were conversing with him. Some said, What does this babbler want to say?Others said, He seems to be advocating foreign deities, because he preached Jesus and the resurrection."
44,17,19,"They took hold of him, and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by you?"
44,17,20,"For you bring certain strange things to our ears. We want to know therefore what these things mean."
44,17,21,"Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing."
44,17,22,"Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said, You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious in all things."
44,17,23,"For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: 'TO AN UNKNOWN"
44,17,24,"The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands,"
44,17,25,"neither is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all things."
44,17,26,"He made from one every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons, and the boundaries of their dwellings,"
44,17,27,"that they should seek God, if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us."
44,17,28,"'For in him we live, and move, and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his offspring.'"
44,17,29,"Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of man."
44,17,30,"The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked. But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent,"
44,17,31,"because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead."
44,17,32,"Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We want to hear you again concerning this."
44,17,33,"Thus Paul went out from among them."
44,17,34,"But certain men joined with him, and believed, among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them."
44,18,1,"After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth."
44,18,2,"He found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, who had recently come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome. He came to them,"
44,18,3,"and because he practiced the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers."
44,18,4,"He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks."
44,18,5,"But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah."
44,18,6,"When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!"
44,18,7,"He departed there, and went into the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue."
44,18,8,"Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized."
44,18,9,"The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent;"
44,18,10,"for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city."
44,18,11,"He lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them."
44,18,12,"But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,"
44,18,13,"saying, This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."
44,18,14,"But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;"
44,18,15,"but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I do not want to be a judge of these matters."
44,18,16,"He drove them from the judgment seat."
44,18,17,"Then all laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. Gallio did not care about any of these things."
44,18,18,"Paul, having stayed after this many more days, took his leave of the brothers, and sailed from there for Syria, together with Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow."
44,18,19,"They came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews."
44,18,20,"When they asked him to stay a longer time, he declined;"
44,18,21,"but taking his leave of them, and saying, I will return again to you if God wills, he set sail from Ephesus."
44,18,22,"When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch."
44,18,23,"Having spent some time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples."
44,18,24,"Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was mighty in the Scriptures."
44,18,25,"This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John."
44,18,26,"He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of God more accurately."
44,18,27,"When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;"
44,18,28,"for he powerfully refuted the Jews, publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah."
44,19,1,"It happened that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples."
44,19,2,"He said to them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?They said to him, No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
44,19,3,"He said, Into what then were you baptized?They said, Into John's baptism."
44,19,4,"Paul said, John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in Jesus."
44,19,5,"When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,19,6,"When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with other languages and prophesied."
44,19,7,"They were about twelve men in all."
44,19,8,"He entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for a period of three months, reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the Kingdom of God."
44,19,9,"But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus."
44,19,10,"This continued for two years, so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks."
44,19,11,"God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul,"
44,19,12,"so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and the evil spirits went out."
44,19,13,"But some of the itinerant Jews, exorcists, took on themselves to invoke over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches."
44,19,14,"There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this."
44,19,15,"The evil spirit answered, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?"
44,19,16,"The man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overpowered them all, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded."
44,19,17,"This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified."
44,19,18,"Many also of those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds."
44,19,19,"Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. They counted the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver."
44,19,20,"So the word of the Lord was growing and becoming mighty."
44,19,21,"Now after these things had ended, Paul determined in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
44,19,22,"Having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while."
44,19,23,"About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way."
44,19,24,"For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen,"
44,19,25,"whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, you know that by this business we have our wealth."
44,19,26,"You see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands."
44,19,27,"Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing, and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence, whom all Asia and the world worships."
44,19,28,"When they heard this they were filled with anger, and began to shout, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44,19,29,"The city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel."
44,19,30,"When Paul wanted to enter in to the people, the disciples did not allow him."
44,19,31,"Certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater."
44,19,32,"Some therefore shouted one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most of them did not know why they had come together."
44,19,33,"They brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. Alexander beckoned with his hand, and would have made a defense to the people."
44,19,34,"But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice for a time of about two hours shouted, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44,19,35,"When the town clerk had quieted the multitude, he said, You men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?"
44,19,36,"Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash."
44,19,37,"For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess."
44,19,38,"If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them press charges against one another."
44,19,39,"But if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly."
44,19,40,"For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day's riot, there being no cause. Concerning it, we would not be able to give an account of this commotion."
44,19,41,"When he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly."
44,20,1,"After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia."
44,20,2,"When he had gone through those parts, and had encouraged them with many words, he came into Greece."
44,20,3,"When he had spent three months there, and a plot was made against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia."
44,20,4,"He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus of Beroea; Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia."
44,20,5,"But these had gone ahead, and were waiting for us at Troas."
44,20,6,"We sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days."
44,20,7,"On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and continued his speech until midnight."
44,20,8,"There were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together."
44,20,9,"A certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window, weighed down with deep sleep. As Paul spoke still longer, being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead."
44,20,10,"Paul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him said, Do not be troubled, for his life is in him."
44,20,11,"When he had gone up, and had broken bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, he departed."
44,20,12,"They brought the boy in alive, and were greatly comforted."
44,20,13,"But we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for he had so arranged, intending himself to go by land."
44,20,14,"When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard, and came to Mitylene."
44,20,15,"Sailing from there, we came the following day opposite Chios. The next day we landed at Samos, and the day after we came to Miletus."
44,20,16,"For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost."
44,20,17,"From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders of the church."
44,20,18,"When they had come to him, he said to them, You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,"
44,20,19,"serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews;"
44,20,20,"how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,"
44,20,21,"testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus."
44,20,22,"Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there;"
44,20,23,"except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me."
44,20,24,"But I make my life an account of nothing precious to myself, so that I may finish my race, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God."
44,20,25,"Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about proclaiming the Kingdom, will see my face no more."
44,20,26,"Therefore I testify to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all men,"
44,20,27,"for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God."
44,20,28,"Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which he purchased with his own blood."
44,20,29,"For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock."
44,20,30,"Men will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them."
44,20,31,"Therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears."
44,20,32,"Now I entrust you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build up, and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified."
44,20,33,"I coveted no one's silver, or gold, or clothing."
44,20,34,"You yourselves know that these hands served my necessities, and those who were with me."
44,20,35,"In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
44,20,36,"When he had spoken these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all."
44,20,37,"They all wept a lot, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,"
44,20,38,"sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship."
44,21,1,"When it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara."
44,21,2,"Having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail."
44,21,3,"When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload her cargo."
44,21,4,"Having found the disciples, we stayed there seven days. These said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,5,"When it happened that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey. They all, with wives and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city. Kneeling down on the beach, we prayed."
44,21,6,"After saying goodbye to each other, we went on board the ship, and they returned home again."
44,21,7,"When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. We greeted the brothers, and stayed with them one day."
44,21,8,"On the next day, we departed and came to Caesarea.We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him."
44,21,9,"Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied."
44,21,10,"As we stayed there some days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea."
44,21,11,"Coming to us, and taking Paul's belt, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus says the Holy Spirit: 'So will the Judeans at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'"
44,21,12,"When we heard these things, both we and they of that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,13,"Then Paul answered, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,21,14,"When he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The Lord's will be done."
44,21,15,"After these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem."
44,21,16,"Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we would stay."
44,21,17,"When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly."
44,21,18,"The day following, Paul went in with us to Jacob; and all the elders were present."
44,21,19,"When he had greeted them, he reported one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles through his ministry."
44,21,20,"They, when they heard it, glorified God. They said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Judeans of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Law."
44,21,21,"They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs."
44,21,22,"What then? They will certainly hear that you have come."
44,21,23,"Therefore do what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow."
44,21,24,"Take them, and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the Law."
44,21,25,"But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written our decision that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from sexual immorality."
44,21,26,"Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purified himself and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them."
44,21,27,"When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,"
44,21,28,"crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the Law, and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place!"
44,21,29,"For they had previously seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple."
44,21,30,"All the city was moved, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple. Immediately the doors were shut."
44,21,31,"As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar."
44,21,32,"Immediately he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. They, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul."
44,21,33,"Then the commanding officer came near, arrested him, commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done."
44,21,34,"Some shouted one thing, and some another, among the crowd. When he could not find out the truth because of the noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks."
44,21,35,"When he came to the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;"
44,21,36,"for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him!"
44,21,37,"As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, May I speak something to you?He said, Do you know Greek?"
44,21,38,"Are not you then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?"
44,21,39,"But Paul said, I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you, allow me to speak to the people."
44,21,40,"When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. When there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,"
44,22,1,"Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense which I now make to you."
44,22,2,"When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they were even more quiet. He said,"
44,22,3,"I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the Law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as you all are this day."
44,22,4,"I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women."
44,22,5,"As also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify, from whom also I received letters to the brothers, and traveled to Damascus to bring them also who were there to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished."
44,22,6,"It happened that, as I made my journey, and came close to Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from the sky a great light around me."
44,22,7,"I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'"
44,22,8,"I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' He said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.'"
44,22,9,"Those who were with me indeed saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who spoke to me."
44,22,10,"I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' The Lord said to me, 'Arise, and go into Damascus. There you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do.'"
44,22,11,"When I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus."
44,22,12,"One Ananias, a devout man according to the Law, well reported of by all the Jews who lived in Damascus,"
44,22,13,"came to me, and standing by me said to me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' In that very hour I looked up at him."
44,22,14,"He said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth."
44,22,15,"For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard."
44,22,16,"Now why do you wait? Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.'"
44,22,17,"It happened that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,"
44,22,18,"and saw him saying to me, 'Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not receive testimony concerning me from you.'"
44,22,19,"I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in you."
44,22,20,"When the blood of Stephen, your witness, was shed, I also was standing by, and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him.'"
44,22,21,"He said to me, 'Depart, for I will send you out far from here to the Gentiles.'"
44,22,22,"They listened to him until he said that; then they lifted up their voice, and said, Rid the earth of this fellow, for he is not fit to live!"
44,22,23,"As they yelled, and threw off their cloaks, and threw dust into the air,"
44,22,24,"the commanding officer commanded him to be brought into the barracks, ordering him to be examined by scourging, that he might know for what crime they yelled at him like that."
44,22,25,"When they had tied him up with thongs, Paul asked the centurion who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and not found guilty?"
44,22,26,"When the centurion heard it, he went to the commanding officer and told him, What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman!"
44,22,27,"The commanding officer came and asked him, Tell me, are you a Roman?He said, Yes."
44,22,28,"The commanding officer answered, I bought my citizenship for a great price.Paul said, But I was born a Roman."
44,22,29,"Immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him, and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman, because he had bound him."
44,22,30,"But on the next day, desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Judeans, he freed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them."
44,23,1,"Paul, looking steadfastly at the council, said, Brothers, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day."
44,23,2,"The high priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth."
44,23,3,"Then Paul said to him, God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the Law, and command me to be struck contrary to the law?"
44,23,4,"Those who stood by said, Do you malign God's high priest?"
44,23,5,"Paul said, I did not know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'"
44,23,6,"But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he shouted in the council, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!"
44,23,7,"When he had said this, an argument arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided."
44,23,8,"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess all of these."
44,23,9,"A great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and contended, saying, We find no evil in this man. What if a spirit spoke to him, or an angel?"
44,23,10,"When a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks."
44,23,11,"The following night, the Lord stood by him, and said, Cheer up, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must testify also at Rome."
44,23,12,"When it was day, the Judeans banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul."
44,23,13,"There were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy."
44,23,14,"They came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul."
44,23,15,"Now therefore, you with the council inform the commanding officer that he should bring him down to you, as though you were going to judge his case more exactly. We are ready to kill him before he comes near."
44,23,16,"But Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul."
44,23,17,"Paul summoned one of the centurions, and said, Bring this young man to the commanding officer, for he has something to tell him."
44,23,18,"So he took him, and brought him to the commanding officer, and said, Paul, the prisoner, summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to tell you."
44,23,19,"The commanding officer took him by the hand, and going aside, asked him privately, What is it that you have to tell me?"
44,23,20,"He said, The Judeans have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him."
44,23,21,"Therefore do not yield to them, for more than forty men lie in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him. Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you."
44,23,22,"So the commanding officer let the young man go, charging him, Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me."
44,23,23,"He called to himself two of the centurions, and said, Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with spears, at the third hour of the night."
44,23,24,"He asked them to provide animals, that they might set Paul on one, and bring him safely to Felix the governor."
44,23,25,"He wrote a letter like this:"
44,23,26,"Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings."
44,23,27,"This man was seized by the Judeans, and was about to be killed by them, when I came with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman."
44,23,28,"Desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought him down to their council."
44,23,29,"I found him to be accused about questions of their law, but not to be charged with anything worthy of death or of imprisonment."
44,23,30,"When I was told that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you immediately, charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you."
44,23,31,"So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris."
44,23,32,"But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the barracks."
44,23,33,"When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him."
44,23,34,"When the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from. When he understood that he was from Cilicia, he said,"
44,23,35,"I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive. He commanded that he be kept in Herod's palace."
44,24,1,"After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul."
44,24,2,"When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that by your foresight reforms are coming to this nation,"
44,24,3,"we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness."
44,24,4,"But, that I do not delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words."
44,24,5,"For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes."
44,24,6,"He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him."
44,24,8,"By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him."
44,24,9,"The Judeans also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so."
44,24,10,"When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,"
44,24,11,"seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem."
44,24,12,"In the temple they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city."
44,24,13,"Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me."
44,24,14,"But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the Law, and which are written in the Prophets;"
44,24,15,"having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection, both of the just and unjust."
44,24,16,"Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men."
44,24,17,"Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;"
44,24,18,"amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil."
44,24,19,"They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me."
44,24,20,"Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,"
44,24,21,"unless it is for this one thing that I shouted out standing among them, 'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!'"
44,24,22,"But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case."
44,24,23,"He ordered the centurion that he should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him."
44,24,24,"But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus."
44,24,25,"As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you."
44,24,26,"Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul. Therefore also he sent for him more often, and talked with him."
44,24,27,"But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Judeans, Felix left Paul in bonds."
44,25,1,"Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea."
44,25,2,"Then the high priest and the principal men of the Judeans informed him against Paul, and they begged him,"
44,25,3,"asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem; plotting to kill him on the way."
44,25,4,"However Festus answered that Paul should be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart shortly."
44,25,5,"Let them therefore, said he, that are in power among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him."
44,25,6,"When he had stayed among them more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat, and commanded Paul to be brought."
44,25,7,"When he had come, the Judeans who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove,"
44,25,8,"while he said in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all."
44,25,9,"But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Judeans, answered Paul and said, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be judged by me there concerning these things?"
44,25,10,"But Paul said, I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Judeans, as you also know very well."
44,25,11,"For if I have done wrong, and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!"
44,25,12,"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you shall go."
44,25,13,"Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and greeted Festus."
44,25,14,"As they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;"
44,25,15,"about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the Jewish elders informed me, asking for a sentence against him."
44,25,16,"To whom I answered that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, before the accused has met the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him."
44,25,17,"When therefore they had come together here, I did not delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought."
44,25,18,"Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed;"
44,25,19,"but had certain questions against him about their own religion, and about one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive."
44,25,20,"Being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters."
44,25,21,"But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar."
44,25,22,"Agrippa said to Festus, I also would like to hear the man myself.Tomorrow, he said, you shall hear him."
44,25,23,"So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in."
44,25,24,"Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Judeans petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer."
44,25,25,"But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him."
44,25,26,"Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have something to write."
44,25,27,"For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify the charges against him."
44,26,1,"Agrippa said to Paul, You may speak for yourself.Then Paul stretched out his hand, and made his defense."
44,26,2,"I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you this day concerning all the things that I am accused by the Judeans,"
44,26,3,"especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently."
44,26,4,"Indeed, all Jews know my way of life from my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem;"
44,26,5,"having known me from the first, if they are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee."
44,26,6,"Now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,"
44,26,7,"which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am accused by the Judeans, O King!"
44,26,8,"Why is it judged incredible with you, if God does raise the dead?"
44,26,9,"I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
44,26,10,"This I also did in Jerusalem. I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them."
44,26,11,"Punishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to make them blaspheme. Being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities."
44,26,12,"Whereupon as I traveled to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief priests,"
44,26,13,"at noon, O King, I saw on the way a light from the sky, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who traveled with me."
44,26,14,"When we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'"
44,26,15,"I said, 'Who are you, Lord?'He said, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting."
44,26,16,"But arise, and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the things which I will reveal to you;"
44,26,17,"delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you,"
44,26,18,"to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'"
44,26,19,"Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,"
44,26,20,"but declared first to them of Damascus, at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance."
44,26,21,"For this reason Jews seized me in the temple, and tried to kill me."
44,26,22,"Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the Prophets and Moses said would happen,"
44,26,23,"how the Messiah must suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead, he would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles."
44,26,24,"As he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are crazy! Your great learning is driving you insane!"
44,26,25,"But he said, I am not crazy, most excellent Festus, but boldly declare words of truth and reasonableness."
44,26,26,"For the king knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him, for this has not been done in a corner."
44,26,27,"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."
44,26,28,"Agrippa said to Paul, With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian?"
44,26,29,"Paul said, I pray to God, that whether with little or with much, not only you, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these bonds."
44,26,30,"The king rose up with the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them."
44,26,31,"When they had withdrawn, they spoke one to another, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
44,26,32,"Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."
44,27,1,"When it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band."
44,27,2,"Embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us."
44,27,3,"The next day, we landed at Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself."
44,27,4,"Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary."
44,27,5,"When we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia."
44,27,6,"There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us on board."
44,27,7,"When we had sailed slowly many days, and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone."
44,27,8,"With difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea."
44,27,9,"When much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast had now already gone by, Paul admonished them,"
44,27,10,"and said to them, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
44,27,11,"But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul."
44,27,12,"Because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised going to sea from there, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a port of Crete, looking northeast and southeast."
44,27,13,"When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore."
44,27,14,"But before long, a stormy wind beat down from shore, which is called Euraquilo."
44,27,15,"When the ship was caught, and could not face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven along."
44,27,16,"Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat."
44,27,17,"After they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help reinforce the ship. Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor, and so were driven along."
44,27,18,"As we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard."
44,27,19,"On the third day, they threw out the ship's tackle with their own hands."
44,27,20,"When neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days, and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we would be saved was now taken away."
44,27,21,"When they had been long without food, Paul stood up in the middle of them, and said, Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss."
44,27,22,"Now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship."
44,27,23,"For there stood by me this night an angel, belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve,"
44,27,24,"saying, 'Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.'"
44,27,25,"Therefore, sirs, cheer up! For I believe God, that it will be just as it has been spoken to me."
44,27,26,"But we must run aground on a certain island."
44,27,27,"But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land."
44,27,28,"They took soundings, and found twenty fathoms. After a little while, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms."
44,27,29,"Fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for daylight."
44,27,30,"As the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow,"
44,27,31,"Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."
44,27,32,"Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off."
44,27,33,"While the day was coming on, Paul begged them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing."
44,27,34,"Therefore I beg you to take some food, for this is for your safety; for not a hair will perish from any of your heads."
44,27,35,"When he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it, and began to eat."
44,27,36,"Then they all cheered up, and they also took food."
44,27,37,"In all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship."
44,27,38,"When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea."
44,27,39,"When it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it."
44,27,40,"Casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes. Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach."
44,27,41,"But coming to a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground. The bow struck and remained immovable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves."
44,27,42,"The soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim out and escape."
44,27,43,"But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stopped them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land;"
44,27,44,"and the rest should follow, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. So it happened that they all escaped safely to the land."
44,28,1,"When we had escaped, then we learned that the island was called Malta."
44,28,2,"The natives showed us uncommon kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold."
44,28,3,"But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and placed them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand."
44,28,4,"When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has not allowed to live."
44,28,5,"However he shook off the creature into the fire, and was not harmed."
44,28,6,"But they expected that he would have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly, but when they watched for a long time and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god."
44,28,7,"Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and courteously entertained us for three days."
44,28,8,"It happened that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery. Paul entered in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him."
44,28,9,"Then when this was done, the rest also who had diseases in the island came, and were cured."
44,28,10,"They also honored us with many honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed."
44,28,11,"After three months, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers."
44,28,12,"Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days."
44,28,13,"From there we weighed anchor and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,"
44,28,14,"where we found brothers, and were entreated to stay with them for seven days. So we came to Rome."
44,28,15,"From there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God, and took courage."
44,28,16,"When we entered into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him."
44,28,17,"It happened that after three days Paul called together those who were the Jewish leaders. When they had come together, he said to them, I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,"
44,28,18,"who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me."
44,28,19,"But when the Judeans spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation."
44,28,20,"For this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."
44,28,21,"They said to him, We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you."
44,28,22,"But we desire to hear from you what you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against."
44,28,23,"When they had appointed him a day, many people came to him at his lodging. He explained to them, testifying about the Kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from morning until evening."
44,28,24,"Some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved."
44,28,25,"When they did not agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one word, The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah, the prophet, to your fathers,"
44,28,26,"saying,'Go to this people, and say,in hearing, you will hear,but will in no way understand.In seeing, you will see,but will in no way perceive."
44,28,27,"For this people's heart has grown callous.Their ears are dull of hearing.Their eyes they have closed.Lest they should see with their eyes,hear with their ears,understand with their heart,and would turn again,and I would heal them.'"
44,28,28,"Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the nations. They will also listen. ["
44,28,29,"When he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.]"
44,28,30,"Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who were coming to him,"
44,28,31,"proclaiming the Kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance."
45,1,1,"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the Good News of God,"
45,1,2,"which he promised before through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,"
45,1,3,"concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,"
45,1,4,"who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,"
45,1,5,"through whom we received grace and the office of apostle, for obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name's sake;"
45,1,6,"among whom you are also called to belong to Jesus Christ;"
45,1,7,"to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
45,1,8,"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world."
45,1,9,"For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the Good News of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers,"
45,1,10,"requesting, if by any means now at last I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you."
45,1,11,"For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end that you may be established;"
45,1,12,"that is, that I with you may be encouraged in you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours and mine."
45,1,13,"Now I do not desire to have you unaware, brothers, that I often planned to come to you, and was hindered so far, that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles."
45,1,14,"I am debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish."
45,1,15,"So, as much as is in me, I am eager to proclaim the Good News to you also who are in Rome."
45,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of the Good News, for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes; for the Jew first, and also for the Greek."
45,1,17,"For in it is revealed God's righteousness from faith to faith. As it is written, But the righteous shall live by faith."
45,1,18,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,"
45,1,19,"because that which is known of God is revealed in them, for God revealed it to them."
45,1,20,"For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divine nature; that they may be without excuse."
45,1,21,"Because, knowing God, they did not glorify him as God, neither gave thanks, but became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless heart was darkened."
45,1,22,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,"
45,1,23,"and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things."
45,1,24,"Therefore God also abandoned them in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves,"
45,1,25,"who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen."
45,1,26,"For this reason, God abandoned them to their degrading passions. For their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature."
45,1,27,"Likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error."
45,1,28,"Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God abandoned them to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;"
45,1,29,"being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret slanderers,"
45,1,30,"backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,"
45,1,31,"without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, unmerciful;"
45,1,32,"who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also approve of those who practice them."
45,2,1,"Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things."
45,2,2,"We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things."
45,2,3,"Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?"
45,2,4,"Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?"
45,2,5,"But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God;"
45,2,6,"who will pay back to everyone according to their works:"
45,2,7,"to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;"
45,2,8,"but to those who are self-seeking, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,"
45,2,9,"oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."
45,2,10,"But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."
45,2,11,"For there is no partiality with God."
45,2,12,"For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law."
45,2,13,"For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified"
45,2,14,"(for when Gentiles who do not have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,"
45,2,15,"in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)"
45,2,16,"in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Christ Jesus."
45,2,17,"But if you call yourself a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,"
45,2,18,"and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,"
45,2,19,"and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,"
45,2,20,"a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth."
45,2,21,"You therefore who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who proclaim that a man should not steal, do you steal?"
45,2,22,"You who say a man should not commit adultery. Do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?"
45,2,23,"You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?"
45,2,24,"For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, just as it is written."
45,2,25,"For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision."
45,2,26,"If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won't his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?"
45,2,27,"Won't the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?"
45,2,28,"For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;"
45,2,29,"but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God."
45,3,1,"Then what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the profit of circumcision?"
45,3,2,"Much in every way! Because first of all, they were entrusted with the oracles of God."
45,3,3,"For what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God?"
45,3,4,"May it never be! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written,That you might be justified in your words,and might prevail when you come into judgment."
45,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do."
45,3,6,"May it never be! For then how will God judge the world?"
45,3,7,"For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?"
45,3,8,"Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? Those who say so are justly condemned."
45,3,9,"What then? Are we better than they? No, in no way. For we previously warned both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin."
45,3,10,"As it is written,There is no one righteous;no, not one."
45,3,11,"There is no one who understands.There is no one who seeks after God."
45,3,12,"They have all turned aside.They have together become unprofitable.There is no one who does good,no, not, so much as one."
45,3,13,"Their throat is an open tomb.With their tongues they have used deceit.The poison of vipers is under their lips;"
45,3,14,"Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness."
45,3,15,"Their feet are swift to shed blood."
45,3,16,"Destruction and misery are in their ways."
45,3,17,"The way of peace, they have not known."
45,3,18,"There is no fear of God before their eyes."
45,3,19,"Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be closed, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God."
45,3,20,"Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight. For through the law comes the knowledge of sin."
45,3,21,"But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the Law and the Prophets;"
45,3,22,"even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all those who believe. For there is no distinction,"
45,3,23,"for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;"
45,3,24,"being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;"
45,3,25,"whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God's forbearance;"
45,3,26,"to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus."
45,3,27,"Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what manner of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith."
45,3,28,"We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law."
45,3,29,"Or is God the God of Jews only? Is not he the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,"
45,3,30,"since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith."
45,3,31,"Do we then nullify the law through faith? May it never be! No, we establish the law."
45,4,1,"What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, has found according to the flesh?"
45,4,2,"For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not toward God."
45,4,3,"For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."
45,4,4,"Now to him who works, the reward is not counted as grace, but as debt."
45,4,5,"But to him who does not work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness."
45,4,6,"Even as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works,"
45,4,7,"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven,whose sins are covered."
45,4,8,"Blessed is the man whom the"
45,4,9,"Is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness."
45,4,10,"How then was it counted? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision."
45,4,11,"He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might also be accounted to them."
45,4,12,"The father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision."
45,4,13,"For the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world was not through the law, but through the righteousness of faith."
45,4,14,"For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect."
45,4,15,"For the law works wrath, for where there is no law, neither is there disobedience."
45,4,16,"For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all."
45,4,17,"As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations. This is in the presence of him whom he believed: God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that are not, as though they were."
45,4,18,"Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So will your seed be."
45,4,19,"Without being weakened in faith, he considered his own body, already having been worn out, (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb."
45,4,20,"Yet, looking to the promise of God, he did not waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith, giving glory to God,"
45,4,21,"and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform."
45,4,22,"Therefore it also was reckoned to him for righteousness."
45,4,23,"Now it was not written that it was accounted to him for his sake alone,"
45,4,24,"but for our sake also, to whom it will be accounted, who believe in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead,"
45,4,25,"who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification."
45,5,1,"Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;"
45,5,2,"through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand. We rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
45,5,3,"Not only this, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering works perseverance;"
45,5,4,"and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope:"
45,5,5,"and hope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us."
45,5,6,"For while we were yet weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly."
45,5,7,"For rarely does one die for the righteous. Yet perhaps for a good person someone might dare to die."
45,5,8,"But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
45,5,9,"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we will be saved from God's wrath through him."
45,5,10,"For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his life."
45,5,11,"Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation."
45,5,12,"Therefore, as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin; and so death passed to all men, because all sinned."
45,5,13,"For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged when there is no law."
45,5,14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those whose sins weren't like Adam's disobedience, who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come."
45,5,15,"But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many."
45,5,16,"The gift is not as through one who sinned: for the judgment came by one to condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification."
45,5,17,"For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ."
45,5,18,"So then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through one act of righteousness, all men were justified to life."
45,5,19,"For as through the one man's disobedience many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one, many will be made righteous."
45,5,20,"The law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded more exceedingly;"
45,5,21,"that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,6,1,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"
45,6,2,"May it never be! We who died to sin, how could we live in it any longer?"
45,6,3,"Or do you not know that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?"
45,6,4,"We were buried therefore with him through baptism to death, that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life."
45,6,5,"For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will also be part of his resurrection;"
45,6,6,"knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin."
45,6,7,"For he who has died has been freed from sin."
45,6,8,"But if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him;"
45,6,9,"knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no more has dominion over him!"
45,6,10,"For the death that he died, he died to sin one time; but the life that he lives, he lives to God."
45,6,11,"Thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus."
45,6,12,"Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts."
45,6,13,"Neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God."
45,6,14,"For sin will not have dominion over you. For you are not under law, but under grace."
45,6,15,"What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be!"
45,6,16,"Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as servants to obedience, his servants you are whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?"
45,6,17,"But thanks be to God, that, whereas you were bondservants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered."
45,6,18,"Being made free from sin, you became bondservants of righteousness."
45,6,19,"I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh, for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification."
45,6,20,"For when you were servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness."
45,6,21,"What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death."
45,6,22,"But now, being made free from sin, and having become servants of God, you have your fruit of sanctification, and the result of eternal life."
45,6,23,"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
45,7,1,"Or do you not know, brothers (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives?"
45,7,2,"For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband."
45,7,3,"So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man."
45,7,4,"Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to God."
45,7,5,"For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law, worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death."
45,7,6,"But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter."
45,7,7,"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? May it never be! However, I would not have known sin, except through the law. For I would not have known coveting, unless the law had said, You shall not covet."
45,7,8,"But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead."
45,7,9,"I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."
45,7,10,"The commandment, which was for life, this I found to be for death;"
45,7,11,"for sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me."
45,7,12,"Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good."
45,7,13,"Did then that which is good become death to me? May it never be! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful."
45,7,14,"For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin."
45,7,15,"For I do not know what I am doing. For I do not practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do."
45,7,16,"But if what I do not desire, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good."
45,7,17,"So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me."
45,7,18,"For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing. For desire is present with me, but to do that which is good is not."
45,7,19,"For the good which I desire, I do not do; but the evil which I do not desire, that I practice."
45,7,20,"But if what I do not desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me."
45,7,21,"I find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good, evil is present."
45,7,22,"For I delight in God's law after the inward man,"
45,7,23,"but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members."
45,7,24,"What a wretched man I am! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death?"
45,7,25,"Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ, our Lord! So then with the mind, I myself serve God's law, but with the flesh, the sin's law."
45,8,1,"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus."
45,8,2,"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made you free from the law of sin and of death."
45,8,3,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh;"
45,8,4,"that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
45,8,5,"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit."
45,8,6,"For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace;"
45,8,7,"because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God; for it is not subject to God's law, neither indeed can it be."
45,8,8,"Those who are in the flesh cannot please God."
45,8,9,"But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any man does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not his."
45,8,10,"If Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness."
45,8,11,"But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you."
45,8,12,"So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh."
45,8,13,"For if you live after the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live."
45,8,14,"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are children of God."
45,8,15,"For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, Abba! Father!"
45,8,16,"The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God;"
45,8,17,"and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him."
45,8,18,"For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us."
45,8,19,"For the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed."
45,8,20,"For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in hope"
45,8,21,"that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of God."
45,8,22,"For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now."
45,8,23,"Not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body."
45,8,24,"For we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees?"
45,8,25,"But if we hope for that which we do not see, we wait for it with patience."
45,8,26,"In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we do not know how to pray as we ought. But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."
45,8,27,"He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit's mind, because he makes intercession for the saints according to God."
45,8,28,"We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose."
45,8,29,"For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers."
45,8,30,"Whom he predestined, those he also called. Whom he called, those he also justified. Whom he justified, those he also glorified."
45,8,31,"What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?"
45,8,32,"He who did not spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?"
45,8,33,"Who could bring a charge against God's chosen ones? It is God who justifies."
45,8,34,"Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us."
45,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
45,8,36,"Even as it is written, For your sake we are killed all day long. We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter."
45,8,37,"No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us."
45,8,38,"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,"
45,8,39,"nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
45,9,1,"I tell the truth in Christ. I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,"
45,9,2,"that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart."
45,9,3,"For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers' sake, my relatives according to the flesh,"
45,9,4,"who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;"
45,9,5,"of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen."
45,9,6,"But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel."
45,9,7,"Neither, because they are Abraham's seed, are they all children. But, In Isaac will your seed be called."
45,9,8,"That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as a seed."
45,9,9,"For this is a word of promise, At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son."
45,9,10,"Not only so, but Rebekah also conceived by one, by our father Isaac."
45,9,11,"For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,"
45,9,12,"it was said to her, The elder will serve the younger."
45,9,13,"Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."
45,9,14,"What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be!"
45,9,15,"For he said to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
45,9,16,"So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy."
45,9,17,"For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."
45,9,18,"So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires."
45,9,19,"You will say then to me, Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?"
45,9,20,"But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, Why did you make me like this?"
45,9,21,"Or hasn't the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?"
45,9,22,"What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,"
45,9,23,"and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,"
45,9,24,"us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?"
45,9,25,"As he says also in Hosea,I will call them 'my people,' which were not my people;and her 'beloved,' who was not beloved."
45,9,26,"It will be that in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,'There they will be called 'children of the living God.'"
45,9,27,"Isaiah cries out concerning Israel,If the number of the sons of Israel are as the sand of the sea,it is the remnant who will be saved;"
45,9,28,"for the Lord will fulfill his word completely and without delay upon the earth."
45,9,29,"As Isaiah has said before,Unless the"
45,9,30,"What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who did not follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;"
45,9,31,"but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law."
45,9,32,"Why? Because they did not seek it by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone;"
45,9,33,"even as it is written,Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock that will make them fall;and no one who believes in him will be put to shame."
45,10,1,"Brothers, my heart's desire and my prayer to God is for them, that they may be saved."
45,10,2,"For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge."
45,10,3,"For being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God."
45,10,4,"For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes."
45,10,5,"For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, The one who does them will live by them."
45,10,6,"But the righteousness which is of faith says this, Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down);"
45,10,7,"or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)"
45,10,8,"But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart; that is, the word of faith, which we proclaim:"
45,10,9,"that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
45,10,10,"For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
45,10,11,"For the Scripture says, Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed."
45,10,12,"For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same"
45,10,13,"For, Whoever will call on the name of the"
45,10,14,"How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a proclaimer?"
45,10,15,"And how will they proclaim unless they are sent? As it is written:How beautiful are the feet of thosewho bring glad tidings of good things!"
45,10,16,"But they did not all listen to the glad news. For Isaiah says, "
45,10,17,"So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ."
45,10,18,"But I say, did they not hear? Yes, truly,Their sound went out into all the earth,their words to the ends of the world."
45,10,19,"But I ask, did not Israel know? First Moses says,I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation,with a nation void of understanding I will make you angry."
45,10,20,"Isaiah is very bold, and says,I was found by those who did not seek me.I was revealed to those who did not ask for me."
45,10,21,"But as to Israel he says, All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people."
45,11,1,"I ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."
45,11,2,"God did not reject his people, which he foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:"
45,11,3,""
45,11,4,"But how does God answer him? I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal."
45,11,5,"Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace."
45,11,6,"And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace."
45,11,7,"What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he did not obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened."
45,11,8,"According as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day."
45,11,9,"David says,Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,a stumbling block, and a retribution to them."
45,11,10,"Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see.Bow down their back always."
45,11,11,"I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy."
45,11,12,"Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?"
45,11,13,"For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;"
45,11,14,"if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them."
45,11,15,"For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?"
45,11,16,"If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches."
45,11,17,"But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree;"
45,11,18,"do not boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you."
45,11,19,"You will say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in."
45,11,20,"True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear;"
45,11,21,"for if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you."
45,11,22,"See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off."
45,11,23,"They also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again."
45,11,24,"For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?"
45,11,25,"For I do not desire you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you won't be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,"
45,11,26,"and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written,There will come out of Zion the Deliverer,and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob."
45,11,27,"This is my covenant to them,when I will take away their sins."
45,11,28,"Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake."
45,11,29,"For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable."
45,11,30,"For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,"
45,11,31,"even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy."
45,11,32,"For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all."
45,11,33,"Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!"
45,11,34,"For who has known the mind of the"
45,11,35,"Or who has first given to him,and it will be repaid to him again?"
45,11,36,"For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen."
45,12,1,"Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service."
45,12,2,"And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God."
45,12,3,"For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith."
45,12,4,"For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members do not have the same function,"
45,12,5,"so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another."
45,12,6,"Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;"
45,12,7,"or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;"
45,12,8,"or he who exhorts, to his exhorting: he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness."
45,12,9,"Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good."
45,12,10,"In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another; outdo one another in showing honor;"
45,12,11,"not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;"
45,12,12,"rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer;"
45,12,13,"contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality."
45,12,14,"Bless those who persecute you; bless, and do not curse."
45,12,15,"Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep."
45,12,16,"Be of the same mind one toward another. Do not be arrogant, but associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own conceits."
45,12,17,"Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men."
45,12,18,"If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men."
45,12,19,"Do not seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God's wrath. For it is written, Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord."
45,12,20,"ThereforeIf your enemy is hungry, feed him.If he is thirsty, give him a drink;for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head."
45,12,21,"Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
45,13,1,"Let every soul be in subjection to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those who exist are ordained by God."
45,13,2,"Therefore he who resists the authority, withstands the ordinance of God; and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgment."
45,13,3,"For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Do you desire to have no fear of the authority? Do that which is good, and you will have praise from the same,"
45,13,4,"for he is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who does evil."
45,13,5,"Therefore you need to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience' sake."
45,13,6,"For this reason you also pay taxes, for they are servants of God's service, attending continually on this very thing."
45,13,7,"Give therefore to everyone what you owe: taxes to whom taxes are due; customs to whom customs; respect to whom respect; honor to whom honor."
45,13,8,"Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law."
45,13,9,"For the commandments, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet, and whatever other commandments there are, are all summed up in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
45,13,10,"Love does not harm a neighbor. Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law."
45,13,11,"Do this, knowing the time, that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep, for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed."
45,13,12,"The night is far gone, and the day is near. Let us therefore throw off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light."
45,13,13,"Let us walk properly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts, and not in strife and jealousy."
45,13,14,"But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for its lusts."
45,14,1,"Now accept one who is weak in faith, but not for disputes over opinions."
45,14,2,"One man has faith to eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables."
45,14,3,"Do not let him who eats despise him who does not eat. Do not let him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted him."
45,14,4,"Who are you who judge another's servant? To his own lord he stands or falls. Yes, he will be made to stand, for the Lord has power to make him stand."
45,14,5,"One man esteems one day as more important. Another esteems every day alike. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind."
45,14,6,"He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks."
45,14,7,"For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself."
45,14,8,"For if we live, we live to the Lord. Or if we die, we die to the Lord. If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord's."
45,14,9,"For to this end Christ died, and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living."
45,14,10,"But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God."
45,14,11,"For it is written,'As I live,' says the"
45,14,12,"So then each one of us will give account of himself to God."
45,14,13,"Therefore let us not judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his brother's way, or an occasion for falling."
45,14,14,"I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except that to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean."
45,14,15,"Yet if because of food your brother is grieved, you walk no longer in love. Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died."
45,14,16,"Then do not let your good be slandered,"
45,14,17,"for the Kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit."
45,14,18,"For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men."
45,14,19,"So then, let us follow after things which make for peace, and things by which we may build one another up."
45,14,20,"Do not overthrow God's work for food's sake. All things indeed are clean, however it is evil for that man who creates a stumbling block by eating."
45,14,21,"It is good to not eat meat, drink wine, nor do anything by which your brother stumbles."
45,14,22,"Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who does not judge himself in that which he approves."
45,14,23,"But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it is not of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin."
45,15,1,"Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves."
45,15,2,"Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, to be building him up."
45,15,3,"For even Christ did not please himself. But, as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me."
45,15,4,"For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that through patience and through encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope."
45,15,5,"Now the God of patience and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus,"
45,15,6,"that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
45,15,7,"Therefore accept one another, even as Christ also accepted you, to the glory of God."
45,15,8,"Now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers,"
45,15,9,"and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written,Therefore will I give praise to you among the Gentiles,and sing to your name."
45,15,10,"Again he says,Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people."
45,15,11,"Again,Praise the"
45,15,12,"Again, Isaiah says,There will be the root of Jesse,he who arises to rule over the Gentiles;in him the Gentiles will hope."
45,15,13,"Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit."
45,15,14,"I myself am also persuaded about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others."
45,15,15,"But I write the more boldly to you in part, as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to me by God,"
45,15,16,"that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest the Good News of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
45,15,17,"I have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God."
45,15,18,"For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,"
45,15,19,"in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and around as far as to Illyricum, I have fully preached the Good News of Christ;"
45,15,20,"yes, making it my aim to proclaim the Good News, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build on another's foundation."
45,15,21,"But, as it is written,They will see, to whom no news of him came.They who have not heard will understand."
45,15,22,"Therefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you,"
45,15,23,"but now, no longer having any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come to you,"
45,15,24,"whenever I journey to Spain. For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while."
45,15,25,"But now, I say, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints."
45,15,26,"For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem."
45,15,27,"Yes, it has been their good pleasure, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things."
45,15,28,"When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by way of you to Spain."
45,15,29,"I know that, when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Christ."
45,15,30,"Now I beg you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,"
45,15,31,"that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;"
45,15,32,"that I may come to you in joy through the will of God, and together with you, find rest."
45,15,33,"Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen."
45,16,1,"I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant of the church that is at Cenchreae,"
45,16,2,"that you receive her in the Lord, in a way worthy of the saints, and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you, for she herself also has been a helper of many, and of my own self."
45,16,3,"Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,"
45,16,4,"who for my life, laid down their own necks; to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles."
45,16,5,"Greet the church that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first fruits of Asia to Christ."
45,16,6,"Greet Mary, who labored much for you."
45,16,7,"Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives and my fellow prisoners, who are notable among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me."
45,16,8,"Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord."
45,16,9,"Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved."
45,16,10,"Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus."
45,16,11,"Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet them of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord."
45,16,12,"Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Greet Persis, the beloved, who labored much in the Lord."
45,16,13,"Greet Rufus, the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine."
45,16,14,"Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them."
45,16,15,"Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them."
45,16,16,"Greet one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ greet you."
45,16,17,"Now I beg you, brothers, look out for those who are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and turn away from them."
45,16,18,"For those who are such do not serve our Lord, Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and flattering speech, they deceive the hearts of the innocent."
45,16,19,"For your obedience has become known to all. I rejoice therefore over you. But I desire to have you wise in that which is good, but innocent in that which is evil."
45,16,20,"And the God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."
45,16,21,"Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives."
45,16,22,"I, Tertius, who write the letter, greet you in the Lord."
45,16,23,"Gaius, my host and host of the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, greets you, as does Quartus, the brother."
45,16,24,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all! Amen."
45,16,25,"Now to him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the proclaiming of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages,"
45,16,26,"but now is revealed, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations;"
45,16,27,"to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen."
46,1,1,"Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,"
46,1,2,"to the church of God which is at Corinth; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:"
46,1,3,"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
46,1,4,"I always thank my God concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;"
46,1,5,"that in everything you were enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge;"
46,1,6,"even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:"
46,1,7,"so that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
46,1,8,"who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
46,1,9,"God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord."
46,1,10,"Now I beg you, brothers, through the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment."
46,1,11,"For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those who are from Chloe's household, that there are contentions among you."
46,1,12,"Now I mean this, that each one of you says, I follow Paul, I follow Apollos, I follow Cephas, and, I follow Christ."
46,1,13,"Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?"
46,1,14,"I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,"
46,1,15,"so that no one should say that you had been baptized into my own name."
46,1,16,"(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I do not know whether I baptized any other.)"
46,1,17,"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to proclaim the Good News-not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void."
46,1,18,"For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of God."
46,1,19,"For it is written,I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing."
46,1,20,"Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the Law scholar of this world? Hasn't God made foolish the wisdom of this world?"
46,1,21,"For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the proclaiming to save those who believe."
46,1,22,"For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,"
46,1,23,"but we proclaim Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Gentiles,"
46,1,24,"but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God."
46,1,25,"Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
46,1,26,"For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;"
46,1,27,"but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;"
46,1,28,"and God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are:"
46,1,29,"that no flesh should boast before God."
46,1,30,"But of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:"
46,1,31,"that, according as it is written, He who boasts, let him boast in the"
46,2,1,"When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the mystery of God."
46,2,2,"For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
46,2,3,"I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling."
46,2,4,"My speech and my proclaiming were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,"
46,2,5,"that your faith would not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
46,2,6,"We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing."
46,2,7,"But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory,"
46,2,8,"which none of the rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
46,2,9,"But as it is written,Things which an eye did not see, and an ear did not hear,which did not enter into the heart of man,these God has prepared for those who love him."
46,2,10,"But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God."
46,2,11,"For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God's Spirit."
46,2,12,"But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God."
46,2,13,"Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things."
46,2,14,"Now the natural man does not receive the things of God's Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually discerned."
46,2,15,"But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one."
46,2,16,"For who has known the mind of the"
46,3,1,"Brothers, I could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ."
46,3,2,"I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren't yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,"
46,3,3,"for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, are not you fleshly, and do you not walk in the ways of men?"
46,3,4,"For when one says, I follow Paul, and another, I follow Apollos, are not you men?"
46,3,5,"Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?"
46,3,6,"I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase."
46,3,7,"So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase."
46,3,8,"Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor."
46,3,9,"For we are God's fellow workers. You are God's farming, God's building."
46,3,10,"According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it."
46,3,11,"For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ."
46,3,12,"But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;"
46,3,13,"each man's work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man's work is."
46,3,14,"If any man's work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward."
46,3,15,"If any man's work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire."
46,3,16,"Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and that God's Spirit lives in you?"
46,3,17,"If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God's temple is holy, which you are."
46,3,18,"Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise."
46,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He has taken the wise in their craftiness."
46,3,20,"And again, The"
46,3,21,"Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,"
46,3,22,"whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,"
46,3,23,"and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's."
46,4,1,"So let a man think of us as Christ's servants, and stewards of God's mysteries."
46,4,2,"Here, moreover, it is required of stewards, that they be found faithful."
46,4,3,"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by man's judgment. Yes, I do not judge my own self."
46,4,4,"For I know nothing against myself. Yet I am not justified by this, but he who judges me is the Lord."
46,4,5,"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each man will get his praise from God."
46,4,6,"Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to go beyond the things which are written, that none of you be puffed up against one another."
46,4,7,"For who makes you different? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?"
46,4,8,"You are already filled. You have already become rich. You have come to reign without us. Yes, and I wish that you did reign, that we also might reign with you."
46,4,9,"For, I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death. For we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men."
46,4,10,"We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You have honor, but we have dishonor."
46,4,11,"Even to this present hour we hunger, thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no certain dwelling place."
46,4,12,"We toil, working with our own hands. When people curse us, we bless. Being persecuted, we endure."
46,4,13,"Being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, even until now."
46,4,14,"I do not write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children."
46,4,15,"For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the Good News."
46,4,16,"I beg you therefore, be imitators of me."
46,4,17,"Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church."
46,4,18,"Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you."
46,4,19,"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing. And I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power."
46,4,20,"For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power."
46,4,21,"What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?"
46,5,1,"It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even among the Gentiles, that one has his father's wife."
46,5,2,"You are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you."
46,5,3,"For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing."
46,5,4,"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
46,5,5,"are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
46,5,6,"Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?"
46,5,7,"Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed."
46,5,8,"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
46,5,9,"I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;"
46,5,10,"yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world."
46,5,11,"But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Do not even eat with such a person."
46,5,12,"For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Do you not judge those who are within?"
46,5,13,"But those who are outside, God judges. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves."
46,6,1,"Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?"
46,6,2,"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"
46,6,3,"Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?"
46,6,4,"If then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the church?"
46,6,5,"I say this to move you to shame. Is not there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers?"
46,6,6,"But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers!"
46,6,7,"Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?"
46,6,8,"No, but you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that against your brothers."
46,6,9,"Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor men who practice sexual relations with men,"
46,6,10,"nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the Kingdom of God."
46,6,11,"Such were some of you, but you were washed. But you were sanctified. But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God."
46,6,12,"All things are lawful for me, but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything."
46,6,13,"Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods, but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body."
46,6,14,"Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power."
46,6,15,"Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!"
46,6,16,"Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For, The two, says he, will become one flesh."
46,6,17,"But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."
46,6,18,"Flee sexual immorality! Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body."
46,6,19,"Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you have from God? You are not your own,"
46,6,20,"for you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body."
46,7,1,"Now concerning the things about which you wrote: it is good for a man not to touch a woman."
46,7,2,"But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband."
46,7,3,"Let the husband fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband."
46,7,4,"The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife."
46,7,5,"Do not deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to prayer, and may be together again, that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control."
46,7,6,"But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment."
46,7,7,"Yet I wish that all men were like me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind."
46,7,8,"But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am."
46,7,9,"But if they do not have self-control, let them marry. For it's better to marry than to burn."
46,7,10,"But to the married I command-not I, but the Lord-that the wife not leave her husband"
46,7,11,"(but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife."
46,7,12,"But to the rest I-not the Lord-say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her."
46,7,13,"The woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband."
46,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy."
46,7,15,"Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to peace."
46,7,16,"For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?"
46,7,17,"Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. So I command in all the churches."
46,7,18,"Was anyone called having been circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised."
46,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."
46,7,20,"Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called."
46,7,21,"Were you called being a bondservant? Do not let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it."
46,7,22,"For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord's free man. Likewise he who was called being free is Christ's bondservant."
46,7,23,"You were bought with a price. Do not become bondservants of men."
46,7,24,"Brothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God."
46,7,25,"Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy."
46,7,26,"I think that it is good therefore, because of the distress that is on us, that it is good for a man to be as he is."
46,7,27,"Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife."
46,7,28,"But if you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you."
46,7,29,"But I say this, brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;"
46,7,30,"and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess;"
46,7,31,"and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away."
46,7,32,"But I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;"
46,7,33,"but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife."
46,7,34,"There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world-how she may please her husband."
46,7,35,"This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction."
46,7,36,"But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He does not sin. Let them marry."
46,7,37,"But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, does well."
46,7,38,"So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage does better."
46,7,39,"A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whomever she desires, only in the Lord."
46,7,40,"But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God's Spirit."
46,8,1,"Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."
46,8,2,"But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he does not yet know as he ought to know."
46,8,3,"But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him."
46,8,4,"Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no God but one."
46,8,5,"For though there are things that are called gods, whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many gods and many lords;"
46,8,6,"yet to us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him."
46,8,7,"However, that knowledge is not in all men. But some, being so accustomed to idols until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled."
46,8,8,"But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we do not eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better."
46,8,9,"But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak."
46,8,10,"For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple, won't his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?"
46,8,11,"And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whom the Christ died."
46,8,12,"Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ."
46,8,13,"Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I do not cause my brother to stumble."
46,9,1,"Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have not I seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Are not you my work in the Lord?"
46,9,2,"If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my office of apostle in the Lord."
46,9,3,"My defense to those who examine me is this."
46,9,4,"Have we no right to eat and to drink?"
46,9,5,"Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?"
46,9,6,"Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work?"
46,9,7,"What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and does not eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and does not drink from the flock's milk?"
46,9,8,"Do I speak these things according to the ways of men? Or does not the Law also say the same thing?"
46,9,9,"For it is written in the Law of Moses, You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain. Is it for the oxen that God cares,"
46,9,10,"or does he say it assuredly for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes in the hope of having a share."
46,9,11,"If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things?"
46,9,12,"If others partake of this right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ."
46,9,13,"Do you not know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar?"
46,9,14,"Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News."
46,9,15,"But I have used none of these things, and I do not write these things that it may be done so in my case; for I would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting void."
46,9,16,"For if I proclaim the Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me, if I do not proclaim the Good News."
46,9,17,"For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me."
46,9,18,"What then is my reward? That, when I proclaim the Good News, I may present the Good News without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News."
46,9,19,"For though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more."
46,9,20,"To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;"
46,9,21,"to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law."
46,9,22,"To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some."
46,9,23,"Now I do all things for the sake of the Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it."
46,9,24,"Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run like that, that you may win."
46,9,25,"Every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible."
46,9,26,"I therefore run like that, as not uncertainly. I fight like that, as not beating the air,"
46,9,27,"but I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected."
46,10,1,"Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;"
46,10,2,"and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;"
46,10,3,"and all ate the same spiritual food;"
46,10,4,"and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ."
46,10,5,"However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness."
46,10,6,"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted."
46,10,7,"Neither be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."
46,10,8,"Neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell."
46,10,9,"Neither let us test the Lord, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents."
46,10,10,"Neither grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer."
46,10,11,"Now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come."
46,10,12,"Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he does not fall."
46,10,13,"No temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it."
46,10,14,"Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry."
46,10,15,"I speak as to wise men. Judge what I say."
46,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is not it a sharing of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is not it a sharing of the body of Christ?"
46,10,17,"Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread."
46,10,18,"Consider Israel according to the flesh. Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?"
46,10,19,"What am I saying then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?"
46,10,20,"But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I do not desire that you would have fellowship with demons."
46,10,21,"You cannot both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot both partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons."
46,10,22,"Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?"
46,10,23,"All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful, but not all things build up."
46,10,24,"Let no one seek his own, but his neighbor's good."
46,10,25,"Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience,"
46,10,26,"for the earth is the Lord's, and its fullness."
46,10,27,"But if one of those who do not believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience."
46,10,28,"But if anyone says to you, This was offered to idols, do not eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience."
46,10,29,"Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other's conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience?"
46,10,30,"If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?"
46,10,31,"Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
46,10,32,"Give no occasions for stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God;"
46,10,33,"even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved."
46,11,1,"Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ."
46,11,2,"Now I praise you, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you."
46,11,3,"But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God."
46,11,4,"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head."
46,11,5,"But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved."
46,11,6,"For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered."
46,11,7,"For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man."
46,11,8,"For man is not from woman, but woman from man;"
46,11,9,"for neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man."
46,11,10,"For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels."
46,11,11,"Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord."
46,11,12,"For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God."
46,11,13,"Judge for yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?"
46,11,14,"Doesn't even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?"
46,11,15,"But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering."
46,11,16,"But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God's churches."
46,11,17,"But in giving you this command, I do not praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse."
46,11,18,"For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it."
46,11,19,"For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you."
46,11,20,"When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat."
46,11,21,"For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken."
46,11,22,"What, do you not have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God's church, and put them to shame who do not have? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I do not praise you."
46,11,23,"For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread."
46,11,24,"When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you. Do this in memory of me."
46,11,25,"In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the New Covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me."
46,11,26,"For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes."
46,11,27,"Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord's cup in a manner unworthy will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord."
46,11,28,"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup."
46,11,29,"For he who eats and drinks eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he does not discern the body."
46,11,30,"For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep."
46,11,31,"For if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged."
46,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world."
46,11,33,"Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait one for another."
46,11,34,"But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will set in order whenever I come."
46,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant."
46,12,2,"You know that when you were heathen, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led."
46,12,3,"Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God's Spirit says, Jesus is accursed. No one can say, Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Spirit."
46,12,4,"Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit."
46,12,5,"There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord."
46,12,6,"There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all."
46,12,7,"But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all."
46,12,8,"For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;"
46,12,9,"to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the one Spirit;"
46,12,10,"and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages."
46,12,11,"But the one and the same Spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires."
46,12,12,"For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ."
46,12,13,"For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink of one Spirit."
46,12,14,"For the body is not one member, but many."
46,12,15,"If the foot would say, Because I'm not the hand, I'm not part of the body, it is not therefore not part of the body."
46,12,16,"If the ear would say, Because I'm not the eye, I'm not part of the body, it's not therefore not part of the body."
46,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?"
46,12,18,"But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired."
46,12,19,"If they were all one member, where would the body be?"
46,12,20,"But now they are many members, but one body."
46,12,21,"The eye cannot tell the hand, I have no need for you, or again the head to the feet, I have no need for you."
46,12,22,"No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary."
46,12,23,"Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;"
46,12,24,"whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,"
46,12,25,"that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another."
46,12,26,"When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it."
46,12,27,"Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually."
46,12,28,"God has set some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages."
46,12,29,"Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?"
46,12,30,"Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?"
46,12,31,"But earnestly desire the greater gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you."
46,13,1,"If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal."
46,13,2,"If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing."
46,13,3,"If I dole out all my goods to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, it profits me nothing."
46,13,4,"Love is patient and is kind; love does not envy. Love does not brag, is not proud,"
46,13,5,"doesn't behave itself inappropriately, does not seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil;"
46,13,6,"doesn't rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;"
46,13,7,"bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."
46,13,8,"Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are various languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with."
46,13,9,"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;"
46,13,10,"but when that which is complete has come, then that which is partial will be done away with."
46,13,11,"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things."
46,13,12,"For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I was also fully known."
46,13,13,"But now faith, hope, and love remain-these three. The greatest of these is love."
46,14,1,"Follow after love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy."
46,14,2,"For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries."
46,14,3,"But he who prophesies speaks to men for their encouragement, strengthening, and comfort."
46,14,4,"He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church."
46,14,5,"Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages, but rather that you would prophesy, and he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the church may be built up."
46,14,6,"But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?"
46,14,7,"Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they did not give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?"
46,14,8,"For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?"
46,14,9,"So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air."
46,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none is without meaning."
46,14,11,"If then I do not know the meaning of the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me."
46,14,12,"So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the church."
46,14,13,"Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret."
46,14,14,"For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful."
46,14,15,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also."
46,14,16,"Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he does not know what you say?"
46,14,17,"For you truly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up."
46,14,18,"I thank God, I speak with other languages more than you all."
46,14,19,"However in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language."
46,14,20,"Brothers, do not be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature."
46,14,21,"In the law it is written, By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. Not even thus will they hear me, says the"
46,14,22,"Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe."
46,14,23,"If therefore the whole church is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won't they say that you are crazy?"
46,14,24,"But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all."
46,14,25,"And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed."
46,14,26,"What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build each other up."
46,14,27,"If any man speaks in another language, let it be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret."
46,14,28,"But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the church, and let him speak to himself, and to God."
46,14,29,"Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern."
46,14,30,"But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent."
46,14,31,"For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged."
46,14,32,"The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,"
46,14,33,"for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.As in all the churches of the saints,"
46,14,34,"let the women keep silent in the churches, for it has not been permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as the Law also says."
46,14,35,"If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the church."
46,14,36,"What? Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone?"
46,14,37,"If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord."
46,14,38,"But if someone does not recognize this, he is not recognized."
46,14,39,"Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking with other languages."
46,14,40,"Let all things be done decently and in order."
46,15,1,"Now I declare to you, brothers, the Good News which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand,"
46,15,2,"by which also you are saved, if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you-unless you believed in vain."
46,15,3,"For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,"
46,15,4,"that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,"
46,15,5,"and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve."
46,15,6,"Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some have also fallen asleep."
46,15,7,"Then he appeared to Jacob, then to all the apostles,"
46,15,8,"and last of all, as to the child born at the wrong time, he appeared to me also."
46,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
46,15,10,"But by the grace of God I am what I am. His grace which was bestowed on me was not futile, but I worked more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."
46,15,11,"Whether then it is I or they, so we proclaim, and so you believed."
46,15,12,"Now if Christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
46,15,13,"But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised."
46,15,14,"If Christ has not been raised, then our proclaiming is in vain, and your faith also is in vain."
46,15,15,"Yes, we are found false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that he raised up Christ, whom he did not raise up, if it is so that the dead are not raised."
46,15,16,"For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised."
46,15,17,"If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins."
46,15,18,"Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished."
46,15,19,"If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable."
46,15,20,"But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep."
46,15,21,"For since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man."
46,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive."
46,15,23,"But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ's, at his coming."
46,15,24,"Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power."
46,15,25,"For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet."
46,15,26,"The last enemy that will be abolished is death."
46,15,27,"For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he says, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him."
46,15,28,"When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all."
46,15,29,"Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?"
46,15,30,"Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?"
46,15,31,"I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."
46,15,32,"If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, then let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
46,15,33,"Do not be deceived! Evil companionships corrupt good morals."
46,15,34,"Wake up righteously, and do not sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame."
46,15,35,"But someone will say, How are the dead raised? and, With what kind of body do they come?"
46,15,36,"You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies."
46,15,37,"That which you sow, you do not sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind."
46,15,38,"But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own."
46,15,39,"All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds."
46,15,40,"There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial."
46,15,41,"There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory."
46,15,42,"So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption."
46,15,43,"It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power."
46,15,44,"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body."
46,15,45,"So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul. The last Adam became a life-giving spirit."
46,15,46,"However that which is spiritual is not first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual."
46,15,47,"The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is from heaven."
46,15,48,"As is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly."
46,15,49,"As we have borne the image of those made of dust, we will also bear the image of the heavenly."
46,15,50,"Now I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption."
46,15,51,"Behold, I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,"
46,15,52,"in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed."
46,15,53,"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."
46,15,54,"But when this corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written will happen: Death is swallowed up in victory."
46,15,55,"Death, where is your victory?Death, where is your sting?"
46,15,56,"The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law."
46,15,57,"But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
46,15,58,"Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord's work, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord."
46,16,1,"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded the churches of Galatia, you do likewise."
46,16,2,"On the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come."
46,16,3,"When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem."
46,16,4,"If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me."
46,16,5,"But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia."
46,16,6,"But with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go."
46,16,7,"For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits."
46,16,8,"But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,"
46,16,9,"for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries."
46,16,10,"Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do."
46,16,11,"Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers."
46,16,12,"Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity."
46,16,13,"Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!"
46,16,14,"Let all that you do be done in love."
46,16,15,"Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints),"
46,16,16,"that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors."
46,16,17,"I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied."
46,16,18,"For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that."
46,16,19,"The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the church that is in their house."
46,16,20,"All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss."
46,16,21,"This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand."
46,16,22,"If any man does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Come, Lord!"
46,16,23,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you."
46,16,24,"My love to all of you in Christ Jesus."
47,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:"
47,1,2,"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
47,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;"
47,1,4,"who comforts us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God."
47,1,5,"For as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our comfort also abounds through Christ."
47,1,6,"But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer."
47,1,7,"Our hope for you is steadfast, knowing that, since you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the comfort."
47,1,8,"For we do not desire to have you uninformed, brothers, concerning our affliction which happened in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired even of life."
47,1,9,"Yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,"
47,1,10,"who delivered us out of so great a death, and does deliver; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;"
47,1,11,"you also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed on us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf."
47,1,12,"For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you."
47,1,13,"For we write no other things to you, than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end;"
47,1,14,"as also you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus."
47,1,15,"In this confidence, I was determined to come first to you, that you might have a second benefit;"
47,1,16,"and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be sent forward by you on my journey to Judea."
47,1,17,"When I therefore was thus determined, did I show fickleness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the Yes, yes and the No, no?"
47,1,18,"But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not Yes and no."
47,1,19,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not Yes and no, but in him is Yes."
47,1,20,"For however many are the promises of God, in him they are Yes. Therefore also through him they are Amen, to the glory of God through us."
47,1,21,"Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;"
47,1,22,"who also sealed us, and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts."
47,1,23,"But I call God for a witness to my soul, that I did not come to Corinth to spare you."
47,1,24,"Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your joy. For you stand firm in faith."
47,2,1,"But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow."
47,2,2,"For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?"
47,2,3,"And I wrote this very thing, so that, when I came, I would not have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you."
47,2,4,"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you."
47,2,5,"But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all."
47,2,6,"Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;"
47,2,7,"so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow."
47,2,8,"Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him."
47,2,9,"For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things."
47,2,10,"Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,"
47,2,11,"that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes."
47,2,12,"Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,"
47,2,13,"I had no relief for my spirit, because I did not find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia."
47,2,14,"Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place."
47,2,15,"For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;"
47,2,16,"to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?"
47,2,17,"For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ."
47,3,1,"Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? We do not need, as do some, letters of commendation to you or from you, do we?"
47,3,2,"You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;"
47,3,3,"being revealed that you are a letter of Christ, served by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh."
47,3,4,"Such confidence we have through Christ toward God;"
47,3,5,"not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;"
47,3,6,"who also made us sufficient as servants of a New Covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."
47,3,7,"But if the service of death, written engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which was passing away:"
47,3,8,"won't service of the Spirit be with much more glory?"
47,3,9,"For if the service of condemnation has glory, the service of righteousness exceeds much more in glory."
47,3,10,"For truly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasses."
47,3,11,"For if that which passes away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory."
47,3,12,"Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,"
47,3,13,"and not as Moses, who put a veil on his face, that the children of Israel would not look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away."
47,3,14,"But their minds were hardened, for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains, because in Christ it passes away."
47,3,15,"But to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart."
47,3,16,"But whenever one turns to the"
47,3,17,"Now the"
47,3,18,"But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the"
47,4,1,"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we do not faint."
47,4,2,"But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God."
47,4,3,"Even if our Good News is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish;"
47,4,4,"in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, to prevent the light shining from the Good News of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God."
47,4,5,"For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake;"
47,4,6,"seeing it is God who said, Light will shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
47,4,7,"But we have this treasure in clay vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves."
47,4,8,"We are pressed on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, yet not to despair;"
47,4,9,"pursued, yet not forsaken; struck down, yet not destroyed;"
47,4,10,"always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body."
47,4,11,"For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh."
47,4,12,"So then death works in us, but life in you."
47,4,13,"But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore I spoke. We also believe, and therefore also we speak;"
47,4,14,"knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you."
47,4,15,"For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God."
47,4,16,"Therefore we do not faint, but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day."
47,4,17,"For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;"
47,4,18,"while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
47,5,1,"For we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens."
47,5,2,"For truly in this we groan, longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven;"
47,5,3,"if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked."
47,5,4,"For indeed we who are in this tent do groan, being burdened; not that we desire to be unclothed, but that we desire to be clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life."
47,5,5,"Now he who made us for this very thing is God, who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit."
47,5,6,"Therefore, we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord;"
47,5,7,"for we walk by faith, not by sight."
47,5,8,"We are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord."
47,5,9,"Therefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well pleasing to him."
47,5,10,"For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad."
47,5,11,"Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are revealed to God; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences."
47,5,12,"For we are not commending ourselves to you again, but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf, that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance, and not in heart."
47,5,13,"For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God. Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you."
47,5,14,"For the love of Christ constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died."
47,5,15,"He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again."
47,5,16,"Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on. Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more."
47,5,17,"Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold, new things have come."
47,5,18,"But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;"
47,5,19,"namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation."
47,5,20,"We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God."
47,5,21,"For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."
47,6,1,"Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,"
47,6,2,"for he says,At an acceptable time I listened to you,in a day of salvation I helped you.Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation."
47,6,3,"We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,"
47,6,4,"but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of God, in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,"
47,6,5,"in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;"
47,6,6,"in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,"
47,6,7,"in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,"
47,6,8,"by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;"
47,6,9,"as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed;"
47,6,10,"as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things."
47,6,11,"Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians. Our heart is enlarged."
47,6,12,"You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections."
47,6,13,"Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be open wide."
47,6,14,"Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?"
47,6,15,"What agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?"
47,6,16,"What agreement has a temple of God with idols? For we are a temple of the living God. Even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people."
47,6,17,"Therefore,'Come out from among them,and be separate,' says the"
47,6,18,"I will be to you a Father.You will be to me sons and daughters,'says the"
47,7,1,"Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
47,7,2,"Open your hearts to us. We wronged no one. We corrupted no one. We took advantage of no one."
47,7,3,"I say this not to condemn you, for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live together."
47,7,4,"Great is my boldness of speech toward you. Great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in all our affliction."
47,7,5,"For even when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side. Fightings were outside. Fear was inside."
47,7,6,"Nevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;"
47,7,7,"and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, while he told us of your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced still more."
47,7,8,"For though I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it. For I see that my letter made you sorry, though just for a while."
47,7,9,"I now rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly way, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing."
47,7,10,"For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, which brings no regret. But the sorrow of the world works death."
47,7,11,"For behold, this same thing, that you were made sorry in a godly way, what earnest care it worked in you. Yes, what defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter."
47,7,12,"So although I wrote to you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God."
47,7,13,"Therefore we have been comforted. In our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all."
47,7,14,"For if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf, I was not disappointed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth."
47,7,15,"His affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembers all of your obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him."
47,7,16,"I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you."
47,8,1,"Moreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia;"
47,8,2,"how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality."
47,8,3,"For according to their power, I testify, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,"
47,8,4,"begging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints."
47,8,5,"This was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God."
47,8,6,"So we urged Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace."
47,8,7,"But as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, and in our love toward you, see that you also abound in this grace."
47,8,8,"I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love."
47,8,9,"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich."
47,8,10,"I give a judgment in this: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do, but also to be willing."
47,8,11,"But now complete the doing also, that as there was the readiness to be willing, so there may be the completion also out of your ability."
47,8,12,"For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you do not have."
47,8,13,"For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed,"
47,8,14,"but for equality. Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack; that there may be equality."
47,8,15,"As it is written, He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack."
47,8,16,"But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus."
47,8,17,"For he indeed accepted our exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went out to you of his own accord."
47,8,18,"We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known through all the churches."
47,8,19,"Not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness."
47,8,20,"We are avoiding this, that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is administered by us."
47,8,21,"Having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men."
47,8,22,"We have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you."
47,8,23,"As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are the apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ."
47,8,24,"Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the churches, and of our boasting on your behalf."
47,9,1,"It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,"
47,9,2,"for I know your readiness, of which I boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for a year past. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them."
47,9,3,"But I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared,"
47,9,4,"so that I won't by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) should be disappointed in this confidence."
47,9,5,"I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness."
47,9,6,"Remember this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully."
47,9,7,"Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver."
47,9,8,"And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work."
47,9,9,"As it is written,He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor.His righteousness remains forever."
47,9,10,"Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, will supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;"
47,9,11,"you being enriched in everything to all liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God."
47,9,12,"For this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God;"
47,9,13,"seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all;"
47,9,14,"while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you."
47,9,15,"Now thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift!"
47,10,1,"Now I Paul, myself, entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ; I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you."
47,10,2,"Yes, I beg you that I may not, when present, show courage with the confidence with which I intend to be bold against some, who consider us to be walking according to the flesh."
47,10,3,"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh;"
47,10,4,"for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds,"
47,10,5,"throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;"
47,10,6,"and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience will be made full."
47,10,7,"Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face? If anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ's, so also we are Christ's."
47,10,8,"For though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down) I will not be disappointed,"
47,10,9,"that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters."
47,10,10,"For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is despised."
47,10,11,"Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present."
47,10,12,"For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding."
47,10,13,"But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us, which reach even to you."
47,10,14,"For we do not stretch ourselves too much, as though we did not reach to you. For we came even as far as to you with the Good News of Christ,"
47,10,15,"not boasting beyond proper limits in other men's labors, but having hope that as your faith grows, we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence,"
47,10,16,"so as to proclaim the Good News even to the parts beyond you, not to boast in what someone else has already done."
47,10,17,"But he who boasts, let him boast in the"
47,10,18,"For it is not he who commends himself who is approved, but whom the Lord commends."
47,11,1,"I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you do bear with me."
47,11,2,"For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. For I married you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ."
47,11,3,"But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your minds might be corrupted from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ."
47,11,4,"For if he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not proclaim, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different good news, which you did not accept, you put up with that well enough."
47,11,5,"For I reckon that I am not at all behind the very best apostles."
47,11,6,"Even though I am unskilled in speech, I am not unskilled in knowledge. But in every way we have made this known to you in all things."
47,11,7,"Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you God's Good News free of charge?"
47,11,8,"I robbed other churches, taking wages from them that I might serve you."
47,11,9,"When I was present with you and was in need, I was not a burden on anyone, for the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my need. In everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and I will continue to do so."
47,11,10,"As the truth of Christ is in me, no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia."
47,11,11,"Why? Because I do not love you? God knows."
47,11,12,"But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion, that in which they boast, they may be found even as we."
47,11,13,"For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as Christ's apostles."
47,11,14,"And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light."
47,11,15,"It is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works."
47,11,16,"I say again, let no one think me foolish. But if so, yet receive me as foolish, that I also may boast a little."
47,11,17,"That which I speak, I do not speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting."
47,11,18,"Seeing that many boast after the flesh, I will also boast."
47,11,19,"For you bear with the foolish gladly, being wise."
47,11,20,"For you bear with a man, if he brings you into bondage, if he devours you, if he takes you captive, if he exalts himself, if he strikes you on the face."
47,11,21,"I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet however any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also."
47,11,22,"Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I."
47,11,23,"Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I am more so; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often."
47,11,24,"Five times from the Jews I received forty stripes minus one."
47,11,25,"Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I suffered shipwreck. I have been a night and a day in the deep."
47,11,26,"I have been in travels often, perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from my countrymen, perils from the Gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the wilderness, perils in the sea, perils among false brothers;"
47,11,27,"in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, and in cold and nakedness."
47,11,28,"Besides those things that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily, anxiety for all the churches."
47,11,29,"Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I do not burn with indignation?"
47,11,30,"If I must boast, I will boast of the things that concern my weakness."
47,11,31,"The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is blessed forevermore, knows that I do not lie."
47,11,32,"In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes to arrest me."
47,11,33,"Through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands."
47,12,1,"It is necessary to boast, though it is not profitable. But I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord."
47,12,2,"I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I do not know, or whether out of the body, I do not know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven."
47,12,3,"I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I do not know; God knows),"
47,12,4,"how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."
47,12,5,"On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses."
47,12,6,"For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me."
47,12,7,"By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively."
47,12,8,"Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me."
47,12,9,"He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me."
47,12,10,"Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong."
47,12,11,"I have become foolish. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing."
47,12,12,"Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works."
47,12,13,"For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the churches, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong."
47,12,14,"Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not what is yours, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children."
47,12,15,"I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?"
47,12,16,"But be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception."
47,12,17,"Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you?"
47,12,18,"I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Did not we walk in the same spirit? Did not we walk in the same steps?"
47,12,19,"Have you been thinking all this time that we have been defending ourselves before you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ; and all things, beloved, are for your edifying."
47,12,20,"For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you do not desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots;"
47,12,21,"that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed."
47,13,1,"This is the third time I am coming to you. At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established."
47,13,2,"I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, to those who have sinned before now, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare;"
47,13,3,"seeing that you seek a proof of Christ who speaks in me; who toward you is not weak, but is powerful in you."
47,13,4,"For indeed he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him through the power of God toward you."
47,13,5,"Test your own selves, whether you are in the faith. Test your own selves. Or do you not know as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you?-unless indeed you are disqualified."
47,13,6,"But I hope that you will know that we are not disqualified."
47,13,7,"Now we pray to God that you do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is honorable, though we are as reprobate."
47,13,8,"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."
47,13,9,"For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. And this we also pray for, even your perfecting."
47,13,10,"For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not deal sharply when present, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for tearing down."
47,13,11,"Finally, brothers, rejoice. Be perfected, be comforted, be of the same mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you."
47,13,12,"Greet one another with a holy kiss."
47,13,13,"All the saints greet you."
47,13,14,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all."
48,1,1,"Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),"
48,1,2,"and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:"
48,1,3,"Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,"
48,1,4,"who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father-"
48,1,5,"to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen."
48,1,6,"I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different good news;"
48,1,7,"and there is not another good news. Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the Good News of Christ."
48,1,8,"But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should proclaim to you any good news other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed."
48,1,9,"As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any good news other than that which you received, let him be cursed."
48,1,10,"For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ."
48,1,11,"But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man."
48,1,12,"For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ."
48,1,13,"For you have heard of my way of living in time past in Judaism, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and ravaged it."
48,1,14,"I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers."
48,1,15,"But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me through his grace,"
48,1,16,"to reveal his Son in me, that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood,"
48,1,17,"nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus."
48,1,18,"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and stayed with him fifteen days."
48,1,19,"But of the other apostles I saw no one, except Jacob, the Lord's brother."
48,1,20,"Now about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I'm not lying."
48,1,21,"Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia."
48,1,22,"I was still unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ,"
48,1,23,"but they only heard: He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy."
48,1,24,"And they glorified God because of me."
48,2,1,"Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me."
48,2,2,"I went up by revelation, and I explained to them the Good News which I proclaim among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain."
48,2,3,"But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised."
48,2,4,"This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;"
48,2,5,"to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the Good News might continue with you."
48,2,6,"But from those who were reputed to be important (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God does not show partiality to man)-they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to me,"
48,2,7,"but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcision"
48,2,8,"(for he who appointed Peter to be an apostle of the circumcision appointed me also to the Gentiles);"
48,2,9,"and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, Jacob and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised."
48,2,10,"They only asked us to remember the poor-which very thing I was also zealous to do."
48,2,11,"But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he stood condemned."
48,2,12,"For before some people came from Jacob, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision."
48,2,13,"And the rest of the Jewish believers joined him in his hypocrisy; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy."
48,2,14,"But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the Good News, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, how can you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?"
48,2,15,"We, being Jews by birth, and not Gentile sinners,"
48,2,16,"yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law."
48,2,17,"But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not!"
48,2,18,"For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker."
48,2,19,"For I, through the law, died to the law, that I might live to God."
48,2,20,"I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me."
48,2,21,"I do not make void the grace of God. For if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!"
48,3,1,"Foolish Galatians, who has cunningly deceived you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth as crucified?"
48,3,2,"I just want to learn this from you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?"
48,3,3,"Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?"
48,3,4,"Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?"
48,3,5,"He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?"
48,3,6,"Even as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness."
48,3,7,"Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham."
48,3,8,"The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, In you all the nations will be blessed."
48,3,9,"So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham."
48,3,10,"For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things that are written in the scroll of the Law, to do them."
48,3,11,"Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, The righteous will live by faith."
48,3,12,"The law is not of faith, but, The man who does them will live by them."
48,3,13,"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,"
48,3,14,"that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."
48,3,15,"Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it."
48,3,16,"Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, To seeds, as of many, but as of one, To your seed, which is Christ."
48,3,17,"Now I say this. A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect."
48,3,18,"For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise."
48,3,19,"What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator."
48,3,20,"Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one."
48,3,21,"Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law."
48,3,22,"But the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe."
48,3,23,"But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed."
48,3,24,"So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith."
48,3,25,"But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor."
48,3,26,"For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus."
48,3,27,"For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ."
48,3,28,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
48,3,29,"If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to promise."
48,4,1,"But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of all;"
48,4,2,"but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father."
48,4,3,"So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world."
48,4,4,"But when the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born under the law,"
48,4,5,"that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of children."
48,4,6,"And because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!"
48,4,7,"So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God."
48,4,8,"However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods."
48,4,9,"But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again?"
48,4,10,"You observe days, months, seasons, and years."
48,4,11,"I am afraid for you, that I might have wasted my labor for you."
48,4,12,"I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong,"
48,4,13,"but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time;"
48,4,14,"and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus."
48,4,15,"Where was the blessing you enjoyed? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me."
48,4,16,"So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?"
48,4,17,"They zealously seek you, but for no good purpose; they desire to alienate you, that you may be zealous for them."
48,4,18,"But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you."
48,4,19,"My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you-"
48,4,20,"but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you."
48,4,21,"Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?"
48,4,22,"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the free woman."
48,4,23,"However, the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise."
48,4,24,"These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar."
48,4,25,"For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children."
48,4,26,"But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother."
48,4,27,"For it is written,Rejoice, you barren who do not bear.Break forth and shout, you that do not travail.For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has a husband."
48,4,28,"Now you, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise."
48,4,29,"But as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now."
48,4,30,"However what does the Scripture say? Throw out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman."
48,4,31,"So then, brothers, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the free woman."
48,5,1,"Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage."
48,5,2,"Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing."
48,5,3,"Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law."
48,5,4,"You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace."
48,5,5,"For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness."
48,5,6,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love."
48,5,7,"You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?"
48,5,8,"This persuasion is not from him who calls you."
48,5,9,"A little yeast grows through the whole lump."
48,5,10,"I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is."
48,5,11,"But I, brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed."
48,5,12,"I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off."
48,5,13,"For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only do not use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another."
48,5,14,"For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
48,5,15,"But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you do not consume one another."
48,5,16,"But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desires of the flesh."
48,5,17,"For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire."
48,5,18,"But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law."
48,5,19,"Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,"
48,5,20,"idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,"
48,5,21,"envyings, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God."
48,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,"
48,5,23,"gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law."
48,5,24,"Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts."
48,5,25,"If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit."
48,5,26,"Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another."
48,6,1,"Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also are not tempted."
48,6,2,"Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the Law of Christ."
48,6,3,"For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself."
48,6,4,"But let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor."
48,6,5,"For each man will bear his own burden."
48,6,6,"But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches."
48,6,7,"Do not be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap."
48,6,8,"For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life."
48,6,9,"Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we do not give up."
48,6,10,"So then, as we have opportunity, let us do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith."
48,6,11,"See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand."
48,6,12,"As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ."
48,6,13,"For even they who receive circumcision do not keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh."
48,6,14,"But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world."
48,6,15,"For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation."
48,6,16,"As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God's Israel."
48,6,17,"From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body."
48,6,18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen."
49,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God,to the saints who are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:"
49,1,2,"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
49,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ;"
49,1,4,"even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love;"
49,1,5,"having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,"
49,1,6,"to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved One,"
49,1,7,"in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,"
49,1,8,"which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,"
49,1,9,"making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him"
49,1,10,"to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in him;"
49,1,11,"in whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will;"
49,1,12,"to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:"
49,1,13,"in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the Good News of your salvation,-in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,"
49,1,14,"who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of his glory."
49,1,15,"For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which you have toward all the saints,"
49,1,16,"do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,"
49,1,17,"that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;"
49,1,18,"having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,"
49,1,19,"and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might"
49,1,20,"which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,"
49,1,21,"far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come."
49,1,22,"He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the church,"
49,1,23,"which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all."
49,2,1,"You were made alive when you were dead in your transgressions and sins,"
49,2,2,"in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience;"
49,2,3,"among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest."
49,2,4,"But God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,"
49,2,5,"even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),"
49,2,6,"and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,"
49,2,7,"that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus;"
49,2,8,"for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,"
49,2,9,"not of works, that no one would boast."
49,2,10,"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared before that we would walk in them."
49,2,11,"Therefore remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision, (in the flesh, made by hands);"
49,2,12,"that you were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world."
49,2,13,"But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ."
49,2,14,"For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition,"
49,2,15,"having abolished in the flesh the hostility, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man of the two, making peace;"
49,2,16,"and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having killed the hostility thereby."
49,2,17,"He came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near."
49,2,18,"For through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father."
49,2,19,"So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,"
49,2,20,"being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief cornerstone;"
49,2,21,"in whom the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord;"
49,2,22,"in whom you also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit."
49,3,1,"For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,"
49,3,2,"if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you;"
49,3,3,"how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,"
49,3,4,"by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;"
49,3,5,"which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;"
49,3,6,"that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News,"
49,3,7,"of which I was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power."
49,3,8,"To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to proclaim to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,"
49,3,9,"and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things;"
49,3,10,"to the intent that now through the church the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places,"
49,3,11,"according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord;"
49,3,12,"in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him."
49,3,13,"Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory."
49,3,14,"For this cause, I bow my knees before the Father,"
49,3,15,"from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,"
49,3,16,"that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;"
49,3,17,"that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love,"
49,3,18,"may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,"
49,3,19,"and to know Christ's love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God."
49,3,20,"Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,"
49,3,21,"to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen."
49,4,1,"I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,"
49,4,2,"with all lowliness and humility, with patience, bearing with one another in love;"
49,4,3,"being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
49,4,4,"There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you also were called in one hope of your calling;"
49,4,5,"one Lord, one faith, one baptism,"
49,4,6,"one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all."
49,4,7,"But to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ."
49,4,8,"Therefore he says, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men."
49,4,9,"Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?"
49,4,10,"He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things."
49,4,11,"He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, shepherds and teachers;"
49,4,12,"for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of serving, to the building up of the body of Christ;"
49,4,13,"until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;"
49,4,14,"that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;"
49,4,15,"but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, Christ;"
49,4,16,"from whom all the body, being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love."
49,4,17,"This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,"
49,4,18,"being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts;"
49,4,19,"who having become callous gave themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness."
49,4,20,"But you did not learn Christ that way;"
49,4,21,"if indeed you heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:"
49,4,22,"that you put away, as concerning your former way of life, the old man, that grows corrupt after the lusts of deceit;"
49,4,23,"and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,"
49,4,24,"and put on the new man, who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth."
49,4,25,"Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor. For we are members of one another."
49,4,26,"Be angry, and do not sin. Do not let the sun go down on your wrath,"
49,4,27,"neither give place to the devil."
49,4,28,"Let him who stole steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need."
49,4,29,"Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for building up as the need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear."
49,4,30,"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."
49,4,31,"Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, outcry, and slander, be put away from you, with all malice."
49,4,32,"And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God also in Christ forgave you."
49,5,1,"Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children."
49,5,2,"Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance."
49,5,3,"But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;"
49,5,4,"nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks."
49,5,5,"Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God."
49,5,6,"Let no one deceive you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience."
49,5,7,"Therefore do not be partakers with them."
49,5,8,"For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,"
49,5,9,"for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,"
49,5,10,"proving what is well pleasing to the Lord."
49,5,11,"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them."
49,5,12,"For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of."
49,5,13,"But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light."
49,5,14,"Therefore he says, Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."
49,5,15,"Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;"
49,5,16,"redeeming the time, because the days are evil."
49,5,17,"Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is."
49,5,18,"Do not be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,"
49,5,19,"speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and singing praises in your heart to the Lord;"
49,5,20,"giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father;"
49,5,21,"subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ."
49,5,22,"Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord."
49,5,23,"For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the church, being himself the savior of the body."
49,5,24,"But as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything."
49,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;"
49,5,26,"that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,"
49,5,27,"that he might present the church to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish."
49,5,28,"Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself."
49,5,29,"For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also does the church;"
49,5,30,"because we are members of his body."
49,5,31,"For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. The two will become one flesh."
49,5,32,"This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and of the church."
49,5,33,"Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband."
49,6,1,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right."
49,6,2,"Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise:"
49,6,3,"that it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth."
49,6,4,"You fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."
49,6,5,"Servants, be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;"
49,6,6,"not in the way of service only when eyes are on you, as men pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;"
49,6,7,"with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men;"
49,6,8,"knowing that whatever good thing each one does, he will receive the same again from the Lord, whether he is bound or free."
49,6,9,"You masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him."
49,6,10,"Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might."
49,6,11,"Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."
49,6,12,"For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world's rulers of this darkness, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places."
49,6,13,"Therefore, put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand."
49,6,14,"Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,"
49,6,15,"and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News of peace;"
49,6,16,"above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one."
49,6,17,"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the spoken word of God;"
49,6,18,"with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints:"
49,6,19,"on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the Good News,"
49,6,20,"for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak."
49,6,21,"But that you also may know my affairs, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make known to you all things;"
49,6,22,"whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts."
49,6,23,"Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
49,6,24,"Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love."
50,1,1,"Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ;To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and servants:"
50,1,2,"Grace to you, and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."
50,1,3,"I thank my God whenever I remember you,"
50,1,4,"always in every request of mine on behalf of you all making my requests with joy,"
50,1,5,"for your partnership in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now;"
50,1,6,"being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ."
50,1,7,"It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me of grace."
50,1,8,"For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus."
50,1,9,"This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;"
50,1,10,"so that you may approve the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ;"
50,1,11,"being filled with the fruit of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God."
50,1,12,"Now I desire to have you know, brothers, that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News;"
50,1,13,"so that it became evident to the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;"
50,1,14,"and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear."
50,1,15,"Some indeed proclaim Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will."
50,1,16,"The former insincerely proclaim Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;"
50,1,17,"but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News."
50,1,18,"What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether out of false motives or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice."
50,1,19,"For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,"
50,1,20,"according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death."
50,1,21,"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."
50,1,22,"But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I do not make known what I will choose."
50,1,23,"But I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better."
50,1,24,"Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake."
50,1,25,"Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,"
50,1,26,"that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again."
50,1,27,"Only let your manner of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;"
50,1,28,"and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God."
50,1,29,"Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,"
50,1,30,"having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear is in me."
50,2,1,"If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,"
50,2,2,"make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;"
50,2,3,"doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;"
50,2,4,"each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others."
50,2,5,"Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,"
50,2,6,"who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,"
50,2,7,"but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men."
50,2,8,"And being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the cross."
50,2,9,"Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;"
50,2,10,"that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,"
50,2,11,"and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is"
50,2,12,"So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
50,2,13,"For it is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure."
50,2,14,"Do all things without murmurings and disputes,"
50,2,15,"that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,"
50,2,16,"holding up the word of life; that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain."
50,2,17,"Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all."
50,2,18,"In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me."
50,2,19,"But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing."
50,2,20,"For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you."
50,2,21,"For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ."
50,2,22,"But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News."
50,2,23,"Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me."
50,2,24,"But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly."
50,2,25,"But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need;"
50,2,26,"since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick."
50,2,27,"For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow."
50,2,28,"I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful."
50,2,29,"Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,"
50,2,30,"because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me."
50,3,1,"Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not tiresome, but for you it is safe."
50,3,2,"Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision."
50,3,3,"For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh;"
50,3,4,"though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh, I yet more:"
50,3,5,"circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;"
50,3,6,"concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless."
50,3,7,"However, what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ."
50,3,8,"More than that, I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and count them nothing but refuse, that I may gain Christ"
50,3,9,"and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;"
50,3,10,"that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed to his death;"
50,3,11,"if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead."
50,3,12,"Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect; but I press on, if it is so that I may take hold of that for which also I was taken hold of by Christ Jesus."
50,3,13,"Brothers, I do not regard myself as yet having taken hold, but one thing I do. Forgetting the things which are behind, and reaching forward to the things which are ahead,"
50,3,14,"I press on toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
50,3,15,"Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, think this way. If in anything you think otherwise, God will also reveal that to you."
50,3,16,"Nevertheless, to what we have attained, to the same continue on."
50,3,17,"Brothers, be imitators together of me, and note those who walk this way, even as you have us for an example."
50,3,18,"For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ,"
50,3,19,"whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who think about earthly things."
50,3,20,"For our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;"
50,3,21,"who will change our lowly bodies into the likeness of his glorious body, according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself."
50,4,1,"Therefore, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my beloved."
50,4,2,"I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way in the Lord."
50,4,3,"Yes, I beg you also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the Good News, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life."
50,4,4,"Rejoice in the Lord always! Again I will say, Rejoice!"
50,4,5,"Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is near."
50,4,6,"In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God."
50,4,7,"And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus."
50,4,8,"Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think about these things."
50,4,9,"The things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in me: do these things, and the God of peace will be with you."
50,4,10,"But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your thought for me; in which you did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity."
50,4,11,"Not that I speak in respect to lack, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content in it."
50,4,12,"I know how to be humbled, and I know also how to abound. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need."
50,4,13,"I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
50,4,14,"However you did well that you shared in my affliction."
50,4,15,"You yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the Good News, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only."
50,4,16,"For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need."
50,4,17,"Not that I seek for the gift, but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account."
50,4,18,"But I have all things, and abound. I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God."
50,4,19,"My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus."
50,4,20,"Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever! Amen."
50,4,21,"Greet every holy one in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you."
50,4,22,"All the saints greet you, especially those who are of Caesar's household."
50,4,23,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
51,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother,"
51,1,2,"to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father."
51,1,3,"We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,"
51,1,4,"having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have toward all the saints,"
51,1,5,"because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the Good News,"
51,1,6,"which has come to you; even as it is in all the world and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;"
51,1,7,"even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,"
51,1,8,"who also declared to us your love in the Spirit."
51,1,9,"For this cause, we also, since the day we heard this, do not cease praying and making requests for you, that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,"
51,1,10,"that you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;"
51,1,11,"strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, for all endurance and perseverance with joy;"
51,1,12,"giving thanks to the Father, who made you fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;"
51,1,13,"who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love;"
51,1,14,"in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins;"
51,1,15,"who is the image of the invisible God, existing before all creation."
51,1,16,"For by him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and for him."
51,1,17,"He is before all things, and in him all things are held together."
51,1,18,"He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence."
51,1,19,"For all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him;"
51,1,20,"and through him to reconcile all things to himself, by him, whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens, having made peace through the blood of his cross."
51,1,21,"You, being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works,"
51,1,22,"yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and blameless before him,"
51,1,23,"if it is so that you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the Good News which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant."
51,1,24,"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church;"
51,1,25,"of which I was made a servant, according to the stewardship of God which was given me toward you, to fulfill the word of God,"
51,1,26,"the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to his saints,"
51,1,27,"to them God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory;"
51,1,28,"whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus;"
51,1,29,"for which I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily."
51,2,1,"For I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;"
51,2,2,"that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, which is Christ,"
51,2,3,"in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden."
51,2,4,"Now this I say that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech."
51,2,5,"For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ."
51,2,6,"As therefore you received Christ Jesus, the Lord, walk in him,"
51,2,7,"rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, even as you were taught, abounding in it in thanksgiving."
51,2,8,"Be careful that you do not let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the elements of the world, and not after Christ."
51,2,9,"For in him all the fullness of God's nature dwells bodily,"
51,2,10,"and in him you are made full, who is the head of all principality and power;"
51,2,11,"in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;"
51,2,12,"having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead."
51,2,13,"You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,"
51,2,14,"wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us; and he has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross;"
51,2,15,"having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it."
51,2,16,"Let no man therefore judge you in eating, or in drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day,"
51,2,17,"which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ's."
51,2,18,"Let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,"
51,2,19,"and not holding firmly to the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments, grows with God's growth."
51,2,20,"If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances,"
51,2,21,"Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch"
51,2,22,"(all of which perish with use), according to the precepts and doctrines of men?"
51,2,23,"Which things indeed appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship, and humility, and severity to the body; but are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh."
51,3,1,"If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God."
51,3,2,"Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth."
51,3,3,"For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God."
51,3,4,"When Christ, your life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory."
51,3,5,"Put to death, therefore, whatever is worldly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;"
51,3,6,"for which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience."
51,3,7,"You also once walked in those, when you lived in them;"
51,3,8,"but now you also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth."
51,3,9,"Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,"
51,3,10,"and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,"
51,3,11,"where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all."
51,3,12,"Put on therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;"
51,3,13,"bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as the Lord forgave you, so you also do."
51,3,14,"Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection."
51,3,15,"And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful."
51,3,16,"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to God."
51,3,17,"Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, through him."
51,3,18,"Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord."
51,3,19,"Husbands, love your wives, and do not be bitter against them."
51,3,20,"Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord."
51,3,21,"Fathers, do not provoke your children, so that they won't be discouraged."
51,3,22,"Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord."
51,3,23,"And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men,"
51,3,24,"knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ."
51,3,25,"But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality."
51,4,1,"Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven."
51,4,2,"Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;"
51,4,3,"praying together for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds;"
51,4,4,"that I may reveal it as I ought to speak."
51,4,5,"Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time."
51,4,6,"Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one."
51,4,7,"All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow bondservant in the Lord."
51,4,8,"I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts,"
51,4,9,"together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you everything that is going on here."
51,4,10,"Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received commandments, if he comes to you, receive him),"
51,4,11,"and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These are my only fellow workers for the Kingdom of God, men who have been a comfort to me."
51,4,12,"Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God."
51,4,13,"For I testify about him, that he has worked hard for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis."
51,4,14,"Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you."
51,4,15,"Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church that is in her house."
51,4,16,"When this letter has been read among you, cause it to be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea."
51,4,17,"Tell Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it."
51,4,18,"The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand: remember my bonds. Grace be with you."
52,1,1,"Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace."
52,1,2,"We always give thanks to God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers,"
52,1,3,"remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father."
52,1,4,"We know, brothers loved by God, that you are chosen,"
52,1,5,"and that our Good News came to you not in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance. You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake."
52,1,6,"You became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,"
52,1,7,"so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia."
52,1,8,"For from you the word of the Lord has been declared, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out; so that we need not to say anything."
52,1,9,"For they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception we had from you; and how you turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God,"
52,1,10,"and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead-Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come."
52,2,1,"For you yourselves know, brothers, our visit to you was not in vain,"
52,2,2,"but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as you know, at Philippi, we grew bold in our God to tell you the Good News of God in much conflict."
52,2,3,"For our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deception."
52,2,4,"But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who tests our hearts."
52,2,5,"For neither were we at any time found using words of flattery, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness (God is witness),"
52,2,6,"nor seeking glory from men (neither from you nor from others), when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ."
52,2,7,"But we were like children among you, like a nursing mother cherishes her own children."
52,2,8,"Even so, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you, not the Good News of God only, but also our own souls, because you had become very dear to us."
52,2,9,"For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail; for working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the Good News of God."
52,2,10,"You are witnesses with God, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe."
52,2,11,"As you know, as a father with his own children,"
52,2,12,"we exhorted, comforted, and implored every one of you to lead a life worthy of God, who calls you into his own Kingdom and glory."
52,2,13,"For this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you received from us the word of the message of God, you accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you who believe."
52,2,14,"For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did from the Judeans;"
52,2,15,"who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and did not please God, and are contrary to all men;"
52,2,16,"forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always. But wrath has come on them to the uttermost."
52,2,17,"But we, brothers, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence, not in heart, tried even harder to see your face with great desire,"
52,2,18,"because we wanted to come to you-indeed, I, Paul, once and again-but Satan hindered us."
52,2,19,"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Is not it even you, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?"
52,2,20,"For you are our glory and our joy."
52,3,1,"Therefore, when we could not stand it any longer, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone,"
52,3,2,"and sent Timothy, our brother and God's fellow worker in the Good News of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith;"
52,3,3,"that no one be moved by these afflictions. For you know that we are appointed to this task."
52,3,4,"For truly, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction, even as it happened, and you know."
52,3,5,"For this cause I also, when I could not stand it any longer, sent that I might know your faith, for fear that by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor would have been in vain."
52,3,6,"But when Timothy came just now to us from you, and brought us glad news of your faith and love, and that you have good memories of us always, longing to see us, even as we also long to see you;"
52,3,7,"for this cause, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith."
52,3,8,"For now we live, since you stand firm in the Lord."
52,3,9,"For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God;"
52,3,10,"night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?"
52,3,11,"Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you;"
52,3,12,"and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward you,"
52,3,13,"to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints."
52,4,1,"Finally then, brothers, we beg and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to live and to please God, even as you are living, that you excel more and more."
52,4,2,"For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus."
52,4,3,"For this is the will of God: your sanctification, that you abstain from sexual immorality,"
52,4,4,"that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,"
52,4,5,"not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who do not know God;"
52,4,6,"that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother or sister in this matter; because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified."
52,4,7,"For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification."
52,4,8,"Therefore he who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who has also given his Holy Spirit to you."
52,4,9,"But concerning brotherly love, you have no need that one write to you. For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,"
52,4,10,"for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brothers, that you abound more and more;"
52,4,11,"and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, even as we instructed you;"
52,4,12,"that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and may have need of nothing."
52,4,13,"But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you do not grieve like the rest, who have no hope."
52,4,14,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus."
52,4,15,"For this we tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep."
52,4,16,"For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with God's trumpet. The dead in Christ will rise first,"
52,4,17,"then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. So we will be with the Lord forever."
52,4,18,"Therefore comfort one another with these words."
52,5,1,"But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you."
52,5,2,"For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night."
52,5,3,"For when they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape."
52,5,4,"But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief."
52,5,5,"You are all children of light, and children of the day. We do not belong to the night, nor to darkness,"
52,5,6,"so then let us not sleep, as the rest do, but let us watch and be sober."
52,5,7,"For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night."
52,5,8,"But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation."
52,5,9,"For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
52,5,10,"who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him."
52,5,11,"Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do."
52,5,12,"But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,"
52,5,13,"and to respect and honor them in love for their work's sake.Be at peace among yourselves."
52,5,14,"We exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all."
52,5,15,"See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, for one another, and for all."
52,5,16,"Rejoice always."
52,5,17,"Pray without ceasing."
52,5,18,"In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you."
52,5,19,"Do not quench the Spirit."
52,5,20,"Do not despise prophesies."
52,5,21,"Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good."
52,5,22,"Abstain from every form of evil."
52,5,23,"May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
52,5,24,"He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it."
52,5,25,"Brothers, pray for us."
52,5,26,"Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss."
52,5,27,"I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the brothers."
52,5,28,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."
53,1,1,"Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
53,1,2,"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,1,3,"We are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers, even as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds;"
53,1,4,"so that we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure."
53,1,5,"This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that you may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you also suffer."
53,1,6,"Since it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who afflict you,"
53,1,7,"and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,"
53,1,8,"giving vengeance to those who do not know God, and to those who do not obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus,"
53,1,9,"who will pay the penalty: eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,"
53,1,10,"when he comes to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired among all those who have believed (because our testimony to you was believed) in that day."
53,1,11,"To this end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith, with power;"
53,1,12,"that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,1,"Now, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to him, we ask you"
53,2,2,"not to be quickly shaken in your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as from us, saying that the day of the Lord had come."
53,2,3,"Let no one deceive you in any way. For it will not be, unless the departure comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,"
53,2,4,"he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he sits in the temple of God, setting himself up as God."
53,2,5,"Do you not remember that, when I was still with you, I told you these things?"
53,2,6,"Now you know what is restraining him, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season."
53,2,7,"For the mystery of lawlessness already works. Only there is one who restrains now, until he is taken out of the way."
53,2,8,"Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth, and destroy by the manifestation of his coming;"
53,2,9,"even he whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,"
53,2,10,"and with all deception of wickedness for those who are being lost, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved."
53,2,11,"Because of this, God sends them a working of error, that they should believe a lie;"
53,2,12,"that they all might be judged who did not believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
53,2,13,"But we are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because God chose you as first fruits for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth;"
53,2,14,"to which he called you through our Good News, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,15,"So then, brothers, stand firm, and hold the traditions which you were taught by us, whether by word, or by letter."
53,2,16,"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,"
53,2,17,"comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word."
53,3,1,"Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, even as also with you;"
53,3,2,"and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for not all have faith."
53,3,3,"But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you, and guard you from the evil one."
53,3,4,"We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things we command."
53,3,5,"May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ."
53,3,6,"Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion, and not after the tradition which they received from us."
53,3,7,"For you know how you ought to imitate us. For we did not behave ourselves rebelliously among you,"
53,3,8,"neither did we eat bread from anyone's hand without paying for it, but in labor and travail worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you;"
53,3,9,"not because we do not have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, that you should imitate us."
53,3,10,"For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither let him eat."
53,3,11,"For we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion, who do not work at all, but are busybodies."
53,3,12,"Now those who are that way, we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread."
53,3,13,"But you, brothers, do not be weary in doing well."
53,3,14,"If any man does not obey our word in this letter, note that man, that you have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed."
53,3,15,"Do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."
53,3,16,"Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all."
53,3,17,"The greeting of me, Paul, with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter: this is how I write."
53,3,18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all."
54,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope;"
54,1,2,"to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
54,1,3,"As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine,"
54,1,4,"neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause speculation, rather than God's stewardship, which is in faith-"
54,1,5,"but the goal of this command is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith;"
54,1,6,"from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;"
54,1,7,"desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm."
54,1,8,"But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,"
54,1,9,"as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"
54,1,10,"for the sexually immoral, nor men who practice sexual relations with men, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;"
54,1,11,"according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust."
54,1,12,"And I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service;"
54,1,13,"although I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief."
54,1,14,"The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
54,1,15,"The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief."
54,1,16,"However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life."
54,1,17,"Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen."
54,1,18,"This instruction I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may wage the good warfare;"
54,1,19,"holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;"
54,1,20,"of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme."
54,2,1,"I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men:"
54,2,2,"for kings and all who are in high places; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence."
54,2,3,"For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;"
54,2,4,"who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth."
54,2,5,"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,"
54,2,6,"who gave himself as a ransom for all; the testimony in its own times;"
54,2,7,"to which I was appointed a proclaimer and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth."
54,2,8,"I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting."
54,2,9,"In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety; not just with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing;"
54,2,10,"but (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works."
54,2,11,"Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection."
54,2,12,"But I do not permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness."
54,2,13,"For Adam was first formed, then Eve."
54,2,14,"Adam was not deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;"
54,2,15,"but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety."
54,3,1,"This is a faithful saying: if a man seeks the office of an overseer, he desires a good work."
54,3,2,"The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching;"
54,3,3,"not a drunkard, not violent, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money;"
54,3,4,"one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence;"
54,3,5,"(but if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?)"
54,3,6,"not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil."
54,3,7,"Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil."
54,3,8,"Servants, in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money;"
54,3,9,"holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience."
54,3,10,"Let them also first be tested; then let them serve if they are blameless."
54,3,11,"Their wives in the same way must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things."
54,3,12,"Let servants be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well."
54,3,13,"For those who have served well gain for themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus."
54,3,14,"These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;"
54,3,15,"but if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
54,3,16,"Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great:He was revealed in the flesh,justified in the spirit,seen by angels,preached among the nations,believed on in the world,and received up in glory."
54,4,1,"But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,"
54,4,2,"through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;"
54,4,3,"forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth."
54,4,4,"For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with thanksgiving."
54,4,5,"For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer."
54,4,6,"If you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed."
54,4,7,"But refuse profane and old wives' tales. Exercise yourself toward godliness."
54,4,8,"For bodily exercise has some value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the life which is now, and of that which is to come."
54,4,9,"This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance."
54,4,10,"For to this end we both labor and strive, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe."
54,4,11,"Command and teach these things."
54,4,12,"Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in faith, and in purity."
54,4,13,"Until I come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation, and to teaching."
54,4,14,"Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders."
54,4,15,"Be diligent in these things. Give yourself wholly to them, that your progress may be revealed to all."
54,4,16,"Pay attention to yourself, and to your teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you."
54,5,1,"Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers;"
54,5,2,"the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity."
54,5,3,"Honor widows who are widows indeed."
54,5,4,"But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to repay their parents, for this is acceptable in the sight of God."
54,5,5,"Now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and continues in petitions and prayers night and day."
54,5,6,"But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives."
54,5,7,"Also command these things, that they may be without reproach."
54,5,8,"But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever."
54,5,9,"Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,"
54,5,10,"being approved by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently followed every good work."
54,5,11,"But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;"
54,5,12,"having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge."
54,5,13,"Besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not."
54,5,14,"I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for reviling."
54,5,15,"For already some have turned aside after Satan."
54,5,16,"If any woman who believes has widows, let her assist them, and do not let the church be burdened; that it might help those widows who are truly in need."
54,5,17,"Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching."
54,5,18,"For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain. And, The laborer is worthy of his wages."
54,5,19,"Do not receive an accusation against an elder, except at the word of two or three witnesses."
54,5,20,"Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear."
54,5,21,"I command you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality."
54,5,22,"Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in other men's sins. Keep yourself pure."
54,5,23,"Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities."
54,5,24,"Some men's sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later."
54,5,25,"In the same way also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden."
54,6,1,"Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed."
54,6,2,"Those who have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things."
54,6,3,"If anyone teaches a different doctrine, and does not consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,"
54,6,4,"he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions,"
54,6,5,"constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain."
54,6,6,"But godliness with contentment is great gain."
54,6,7,"For we brought nothing into the world, so neither can we carry anything out."
54,6,8,"But having food and clothing, we will be content with that."
54,6,9,"But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction."
54,6,10,"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
54,6,11,"But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and gentleness."
54,6,12,"Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses."
54,6,13,"I command you before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession,"
54,6,14,"that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
54,6,15,"which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;"
54,6,16,"who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen."
54,6,17,"Charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be haughty, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy;"
54,6,18,"that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;"
54,6,19,"laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold of that which is truly life."
54,6,20,"Timothy, guard that which is committed to you, turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called;"
54,6,21,"which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you."
55,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,"
55,1,2,"to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
55,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day"
55,1,4,"longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;"
55,1,5,"having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also."
55,1,6,"For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands."
55,1,7,"For God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control."
55,1,8,"Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,"
55,1,9,"who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,"
55,1,10,"but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News."
55,1,11,"For this, I was appointed as a proclaimer, an apostle, and a teacher."
55,1,12,"For this cause I also suffer these things.Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day."
55,1,13,"Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
55,1,14,"That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us."
55,1,15,"This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes."
55,1,16,"May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,"
55,1,17,"but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me"
55,1,18,"(the Lord grant to him to find the"
55,2,1,"You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
55,2,2,"The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also."
55,2,3,"You therefore must share in hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus."
55,2,4,"No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier."
55,2,5,"Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he is not crowned unless he has competed by the rules."
55,2,6,"The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops."
55,2,7,"Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things."
55,2,8,"Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Good News,"
55,2,9,"in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God's word is not chained."
55,2,10,"Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones' sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
55,2,11,"This saying is faithful:For if we died with him,we will also live with him."
55,2,12,"If we endure,we will also reign with him.If we deny him,he also will deny us."
55,2,13,"If we are faithless,he remains faithful,for he cannot deny himself."
55,2,14,"Remind them of these things, charging them in the presence of God, that they do not argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear."
55,2,15,"Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who does not need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth."
55,2,16,"But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness,"
55,2,17,"and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;"
55,2,18,"men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some."
55,2,19,"However God's firm foundation stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those who are his, and, Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."
55,2,20,"Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor."
55,2,21,"If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's use, prepared for every good work."
55,2,22,"Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
55,2,23,"But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife."
55,2,24,"The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,"
55,2,25,"in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,"
55,2,26,"and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him to his will."
55,3,1,"But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come."
55,3,2,"For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,"
55,3,3,"without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,"
55,3,4,"traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;"
55,3,5,"holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof. Turn away from these, also."
55,3,6,"For of these are those who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,"
55,3,7,"always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."
55,3,8,"Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith."
55,3,9,"But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be."
55,3,10,"But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,"
55,3,11,"persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me."
55,3,12,"Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution."
55,3,13,"But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived."
55,3,14,"But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them."
55,3,15,"From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus."
55,3,16,"Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,"
55,3,17,"that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work."
55,4,1,"I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his Kingdom:"
55,4,2,"proclaim the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching."
55,4,3,"For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;"
55,4,4,"and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to myths."
55,4,5,"But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry."
55,4,6,"For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come."
55,4,7,"I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith."
55,4,8,"From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing."
55,4,9,"Be diligent to come to me soon,"
55,4,10,"for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia."
55,4,11,"Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service."
55,4,12,"But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus."
55,4,13,"Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments."
55,4,14,"Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,"
55,4,15,"of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words."
55,4,16,"At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them."
55,4,17,"But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion."
55,4,18,"And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen."
55,4,19,"Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus."
55,4,20,"Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick."
55,4,21,"Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers."
55,4,22,"The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you."
56,1,1,"Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,"
56,1,2,"in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began;"
56,1,3,"but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;"
56,1,4,"to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior."
56,1,5,"I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;"
56,1,6,"if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior."
56,1,7,"For the overseer must be blameless, as God's steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;"
56,1,8,"but given to hospitality, as a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;"
56,1,9,"holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him."
56,1,10,"For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,"
56,1,11,"whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain's sake."
56,1,12,"One of them, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons."
56,1,13,"This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,"
56,1,14,"not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth."
56,1,15,"To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled."
56,1,16,"They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work."
56,2,1,"But say the things which fit sound doctrine,"
56,2,2,"that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience:"
56,2,3,"and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;"
56,2,4,"that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,"
56,2,5,"to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God's word may not be blasphemed."
56,2,6,"Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;"
56,2,7,"in all things showing yourself an example of good works. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness,"
56,2,8,"and a sound message that cannot be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us."
56,2,9,"Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;"
56,2,10,"not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things."
56,2,11,"For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,"
56,2,12,"instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;"
56,2,13,"looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;"
56,2,14,"who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works."
56,2,15,"Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you."
56,3,1,"Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,"
56,3,2,"to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men."
56,3,3,"For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another."
56,3,4,"But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,"
56,3,5,"not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of rebirth and renewing by the Holy Spirit,"
56,3,6,"whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;"
56,3,7,"that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
56,3,8,"This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;"
56,3,9,"but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain."
56,3,10,"Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;"
56,3,11,"knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned."
56,3,12,"When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there."
56,3,13,"Send Zenas, the Law scholar, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them."
56,3,14,"Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful."
56,3,15,"All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all."
57,1,1,"Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,"
57,1,2,"and to Apphia our sister, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:"
57,1,3,"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
57,1,4,"I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,"
57,1,5,"hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;"
57,1,6,"that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ."
57,1,7,"For I have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother."
57,1,8,"Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,"
57,1,9,"yet for love's sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ."
57,1,10,"I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus,"
57,1,11,"who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me."
57,1,12,"I am sending back to you, him who is my very heart,"
57,1,13,"whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News."
57,1,14,"But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will."
57,1,15,"For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,"
57,1,16,"no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord."
57,1,17,"If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me."
57,1,18,"But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account."
57,1,19,"I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides)."
57,1,20,"Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ."
57,1,21,"Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say."
57,1,22,"Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you."
57,1,23,"Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,"
57,1,24,"as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers."
57,1,25,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
58,1,1,"God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,"
58,1,2,"has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds."
58,1,3,"His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had made, through himself, purification for sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;"
58,1,4,"having become so much better than the angels, as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have."
58,1,5,"For to which of the angels did he say at any time,You are my Son.Today have I become your father?and again,I will be to him a Father,and he will be to me a Son?"
58,1,6,"Again, when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says, Let all the angels of God worship him."
58,1,7,"Of the angels he says,Who makes his angels winds,and his servants a flame of fire."
58,1,8,"But of the Son he says,Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom."
58,1,9,"You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows."
58,1,10,"And,You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth.The heavens are the works of your hands."
58,1,11,"They will perish, but you continue.They all will grow old like a garment does."
58,1,12,"As a mantle, you will roll them up,and like a garment they will be changed.But you remain the same, andyour years will have no end."
58,1,13,"But which of the angels has he told at any time,Sit at my right hand,until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?"
58,1,14,"Are not they all serving spirits, sent out to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?"
58,2,1,"Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard, so that we will not drift away."
58,2,2,"For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense;"
58,2,3,"how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation-which at the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard;"
58,2,4,"God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?"
58,2,5,"For he did not subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels."
58,2,6,"But one has somewhere testified, saying,What is man, that you think of him?Or the son of man, that you care for him?"
58,2,7,"You made him a little lower than the angels.You crowned him with glory and honor."
58,2,8,"[You have put all things in subjection under his feet.]For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not see all things subjected to him, yet."
58,2,9,"But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone."
58,2,10,"For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
58,2,11,"For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,"
58,2,12,"saying,I will declare your name to my brothers.In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise."
58,2,13,"Again, I will put my trust in him. Again, Behold, here I am with the children whom God has given me."
58,2,14,"Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,"
58,2,15,"and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."
58,2,16,"For, truly, he did not come to help the angels, but to help the seed of Abraham."
58,2,17,"Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people."
58,2,18,"For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted."
58,3,1,"Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;"
58,3,2,"who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house."
58,3,3,"For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor than the house."
58,3,4,"For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God."
58,3,5,"Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,"
58,3,6,"but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end."
58,3,7,"Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says,Today if you will hear his voice,"
58,3,8,"do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,"
58,3,9,"where your fathers tested me and challenged me,and saw my works for forty years."
58,3,10,"Therefore I was displeased with this generation,and said, 'They always err in their heart,but they did not know my ways;'"
58,3,11,"as I swore in my wrath,'They will not enter into my rest.'"
58,3,12,"Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;"
58,3,13,"but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called today; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
58,3,14,"For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end:"
58,3,15,"while it is said,Today if you will hear his voice,do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion."
58,3,16,"For who, when they heard, rebelled? No, did not all those who came out of Egypt by Moses?"
58,3,17,"With whom was he displeased forty years? Was not it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?"
58,3,18,"To whom did he swear that they would not enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?"
58,3,19,"We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief."
58,4,1,"Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest."
58,4,2,"For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard did not profit them, because they were not united by faith with those who heard."
58,4,3,"For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world."
58,4,4,"For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, God rested on the seventh day from all his works;"
58,4,5,"and in this place again, They will not enter into my rest."
58,4,6,"Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein, and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,"
58,4,7,"he again defines a certain day, Today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said),Today if you will hear his voice,do not harden your hearts."
58,4,8,"For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day."
58,4,9,"There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God."
58,4,10,"For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his."
58,4,11,"Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience."
58,4,12,"For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart."
58,4,13,"There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do."
58,4,14,"Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our confession."
58,4,15,"For we do not have a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin."
58,4,16,"Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of need."
58,5,1,"For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins."
58,5,2,"The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness."
58,5,3,"Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself."
58,5,4,"Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was."
58,5,5,"So also Christ did not glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him,You are my Son.Today I have become your father."
58,5,6,"As he says also in another place,You are a priest forever,after the order of Melchizedek."
58,5,7,"He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,"
58,5,8,"though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered."
58,5,9,"Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,"
58,5,10,"named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek."
58,5,11,"About him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing."
58,5,12,"For when by reason of the time you ought to be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food."
58,5,13,"For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby."
58,5,14,"But solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil."
58,6,1,"Therefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on to perfection-not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God,"
58,6,2,"of the teaching of washings, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment."
58,6,3,"This will we do, if God permits."
58,6,4,"For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,"
58,6,5,"and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,"
58,6,6,"and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put him to open shame."
58,6,7,"For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it, and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from God;"
58,6,8,"but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned."
58,6,9,"But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, even though we speak like this."
58,6,10,"For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the love which you showed toward his name, in that you served the saints, and still do serve them."
58,6,11,"We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,"
58,6,12,"that you won't be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited the promises."
58,6,13,"For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he swore by himself,"
58,6,14,"saying, Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you."
58,6,15,"Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise."
58,6,16,"For men swear by a greater one, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation."
58,6,17,"In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;"
58,6,18,"that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us."
58,6,19,"This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil;"
58,6,20,"where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."
58,7,1,"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,"
58,7,2,"to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace;"
58,7,3,"without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God), remains a priest continually."
58,7,4,"Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best spoils."
58,7,5,"They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the Law, that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the body of Abraham,"
58,7,6,"but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises."
58,7,7,"But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater."
58,7,8,"Here people who die receive tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives."
58,7,9,"We can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes,"
58,7,10,"for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him."
58,7,11,"Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?"
58,7,12,"For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made also in the law."
58,7,13,"For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar."
58,7,14,"For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests."
58,7,15,"This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest,"
58,7,16,"who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life:"
58,7,17,"for it is testified,You are a priest forever,according to the order of Melchizedek."
58,7,18,"For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness"
58,7,19,"(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God."
58,7,20,"Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath"
58,7,21,"(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath), but he with an oath by him that says of him,The"
58,7,22,"By so much, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant."
58,7,23,"Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from continuing by death."
58,7,24,"But he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable."
58,7,25,"Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them."
58,7,26,"For such a high priest was fitting for us: holy, guiltless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;"
58,7,27,"who does not need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For he did this once for all, when he offered up himself."
58,7,28,"For the Law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath which came after the Law appoints a Son forever who has been perfected."
58,8,1,"Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,"
58,8,2,"a servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the"
58,8,3,"For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer."
58,8,4,"Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the Law;"
58,8,5,"who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain."
58,8,6,"But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as Law."
58,8,7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second."
58,8,8,"For finding fault with them, he said,Behold, the days come, says the"
58,8,9,"not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers,in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;for they did not continue in my covenant,and I disregarded them, says the"
58,8,10,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel.After those days, says the"
58,8,11,"They will not teach every man his fellow citizen,and every man his brother, saying, 'Know the"
58,8,12,"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness.I will remember their sins no more."
58,8,13,"In that he says, A New Covenant, he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away."
58,9,1,"Now indeed even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary."
58,9,2,"For a tabernacle was prepared. In the first part were the lampstand, the table, and the show bread; which is called the Holy Place."
58,9,3,"After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,"
58,9,4,"having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;"
58,9,5,"and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we cannot speak now in detail."
58,9,6,"Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services,"
58,9,7,"but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people."
58,9,8,"The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place was not yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing;"
58,9,9,"which is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshipper perfect;"
58,9,10,"being only (with meats and drinks and various washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation."
58,9,11,"But Christ having come as a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,"
58,9,12,"nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption."
58,9,13,"For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh:"
58,9,14,"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
58,9,15,"For this reason he is the mediator of a New Covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance."
58,9,16,"For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it."
58,9,17,"For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives."
58,9,18,"Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood."
58,9,19,"For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,"
58,9,20,"saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you."
58,9,21,"Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in like manner with the blood."
58,9,22,"According to the Law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission."
58,9,23,"It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."
58,9,24,"For Christ hasn't entered into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;"
58,9,25,"nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,"
58,9,26,"or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself."
58,9,27,"Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment,"
58,9,28,"so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation."
58,10,1,"For the Law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near."
58,10,2,"Or else would not they have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins?"
58,10,3,"But in those sacrifices there is yearly reminder of sins."
58,10,4,"For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins."
58,10,5,"Therefore when he comes into the world, he says,Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,but you prepared a body for me;"
58,10,6,"You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin."
58,10,7,"Then I said, 'Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me)to do your will, O God.'"
58,10,8,"Previously saying, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you did not desire, neither had pleasure in them (those which are offered according to the Law),"
58,10,9,"then he has said, Behold, I have come to do your will. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second,"
58,10,10,"by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."
58,10,11,"Every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,"
58,10,12,"but this one, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;"
58,10,13,"from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet."
58,10,14,"For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified."
58,10,15,"The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,"
58,10,16,"This is the covenant that I will make with them:'After those days,' says the"
58,10,17,"I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more."
58,10,18,"Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin."
58,10,19,"Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,"
58,10,20,"by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;"
58,10,21,"and having a great priest over the house of God,"
58,10,22,"let us draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed with pure water,"
58,10,23,"let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering; for he who promised is faithful."
58,10,24,"Let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works,"
58,10,25,"not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as you see the Day approaching."
58,10,26,"For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,"
58,10,27,"but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries."
58,10,28,"A man who disregards the Law of Moses dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses."
58,10,29,"How much worse punishment, do you think, will he be judged worthy of, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?"
58,10,30,"For we know him who said, Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay. Again, The"
58,10,31,"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."
58,10,32,"But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings;"
58,10,33,"partly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions; and partly, becoming partakers with those who were treated so."
58,10,34,"For you both had compassion on them that were in chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one."
58,10,35,"Therefore do not throw away your boldness, which has a great reward."
58,10,36,"For you need endurance so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise."
58,10,37,"In a very little while,he who comes will come, and will not wait."
58,10,38,"But my righteous one will live by faith.If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him."
58,10,39,"But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul."
58,11,1,"Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things not seen."
58,11,2,"For by this, the elders obtained testimony."
58,11,3,"By faith, we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible."
58,11,4,"By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead, still speaks."
58,11,5,"By faith, Enoch was taken away, so that he would not see death, and he was not found, because God took him away. For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God."
58,11,6,"Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him."
58,11,7,"By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith."
58,11,8,"By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he went."
58,11,9,"By faith, he lived as a foreigner in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise."
58,11,10,"For he looked for the city which has the foundations, whose builder and maker is God."
58,11,11,"By faith he received power to procreate when he was past age, and Sarah herself was barren. He regarded him faithful who had promised."
58,11,12,"Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead."
58,11,13,"These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth."
58,11,14,"For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own."
58,11,15,"If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had enough time to return."
58,11,16,"But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them."
58,11,17,"By faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son;"
58,11,18,"even he to whom it was said, In Isaac will your seed be called;"
58,11,19,"concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead."
58,11,20,"By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come."
58,11,21,"By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff."
58,11,22,"By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave instructions concerning his bones."
58,11,23,"By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king's commandment."
58,11,24,"By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,"
58,11,25,"choosing rather to share ill treatment with God's people, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time;"
58,11,26,"accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward."
58,11,27,"By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible."
58,11,28,"By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them."
58,11,29,"By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up."
58,11,30,"By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven days."
58,11,31,"By faith, Rahab the prostitute, did not perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies in peace."
58,11,32,"What more shall I say? For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets;"
58,11,33,"who, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,"
58,11,34,"quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, grew mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee."
58,11,35,"Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection."
58,11,36,"Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover by bonds and imprisonment."
58,11,37,"They were stoned. They were sawn apart. They were slain with the sword. They went around in sheep skins and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated"
58,11,38,"(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts, mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth."
58,11,39,"These all, having had testimony given to them through their faith, did not receive the promise,"
58,11,40,"God having provided some better thing concerning us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect."
58,12,1,"Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,"
58,12,2,"looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
58,12,3,"For consider him who has endured such hostility from sinners against himself, that you do not grow weary, fainting in your souls."
58,12,4,"You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin;"
58,12,5,"and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children,My son, do not take lightly the chastening of the"
58,12,6,"For whom the"
58,12,7,"It is for discipline that you endure. God deals with you as with children, for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?"
58,12,8,"But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then are you illegitimate, and not children."
58,12,9,"Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?"
58,12,10,"For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness."
58,12,11,"All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby."
58,12,12,"Therefore, lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,"
58,12,13,"and make straight paths for your feet, so that which is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed."
58,12,14,"Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,"
58,12,15,"looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and many be defiled by it;"
58,12,16,"lest there be any sexually immoral person, or profane person, like Esau, who sold his own birthright for one meal."
58,12,17,"For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears."
58,12,18,"For you have not come to something that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and darkness, gloom, and storm,"
58,12,19,"the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,"
58,12,20,"for they could not stand that which was commanded, If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned;"
58,12,21,"and so fearful was the appearance, that Moses said, I am terrified and trembling."
58,12,22,"But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable multitudes of angels,"
58,12,23,"to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,"
58,12,24,"to Jesus, the mediator of a New Covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel."
58,12,25,"See that you do not refuse him who speaks. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned on the Earth, how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,"
58,12,26,"whose voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens."
58,12,27,"This phrase, Yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain."
58,12,28,"So since we are receiving a Kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us give thanks, through which we may offer service pleasing to God, with reverence and awe,"
58,12,29,"for our God is a consuming fire."
58,13,1,"Let brotherly love continue."
58,13,2,"Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for in doing so, some have entertained angels without knowing it."
58,13,3,"Remember those who are in bonds, as bound with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you are also in the body."
58,13,4,"Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled: for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers."
58,13,5,"Be free from the love of money, content with such things as you have, for he has said, I will never leave you or forsake you."
58,13,6,"So that with good courage we say,The"
58,13,7,"Remember your leaders, men who spoke to you the word of God, and considering the results of their conduct, imitate their faith."
58,13,8,"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever."
58,13,9,"Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings, for it is good that the heart be established by grace, not by food, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited."
58,13,10,"We have an altar from which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat."
58,13,11,"For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside of the camp."
58,13,12,"Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside of the gate."
58,13,13,"Let us therefore go out to him outside of the camp, bearing his reproach."
58,13,14,"For we do not have here an enduring city, but we seek that which is to come."
58,13,15,"Through him, then, let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name."
58,13,16,"But do not forget to be doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."
58,13,17,"Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they watch on behalf of your souls, as those who will give account, that they may do this with joy, and not with groaning, for that would be unprofitable for you."
58,13,18,"Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things."
58,13,19,"I strongly urge you to do this, that I may be restored to you sooner."
58,13,20,"Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus,"
58,13,21,"make you complete in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever. Amen."
58,13,22,"But I exhort you, brothers, endure the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words."
58,13,23,"Know that our brother Timothy has been freed, with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you."
58,13,24,"Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy send you greetings."
58,13,25,"Grace be with you all."
59,1,1,"Jacob, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are in the Diaspora: Greetings."
59,1,2,"Count it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various temptations,"
59,1,3,"knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance."
59,1,4,"Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."
59,1,5,"But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach; and it will be given to him."
59,1,6,"But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed."
59,1,7,"For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord."
59,1,8,"He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways."
59,1,9,"But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position;"
59,1,10,"and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away."
59,1,11,"For the sun arises with the scorching wind, and withers the grass, and the flower in it falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits."
59,1,12,"Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which he promised to those who love him."
59,1,13,"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted by God, for God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one."
59,1,14,"But each one is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed."
59,1,15,"Then the lust, when it has conceived, bears sin; and the sin, when it is full grown, brings forth death."
59,1,16,"Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers."
59,1,17,"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, nor turning shadow."
59,1,18,"Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures."
59,1,19,"This you know, my beloved brothers. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;"
59,1,20,"for the anger of man does not accomplish the righteousness of God."
59,1,21,"Therefore, putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls."
59,1,22,"But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves."
59,1,23,"For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror;"
59,1,24,"for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was."
59,1,25,"But he who looks into the perfect Law of freedom, and continues, not being a hearer who forgets, but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does."
59,1,26,"If anyone thinks himself to be religious while he does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man's religion is worthless."
59,1,27,"Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world."
59,2,1,"My brothers, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality."
59,2,2,"For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue, and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in;"
59,2,3,"and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing, and say, Sit here in a good place; but you tell the poor man, Stand there, or Sit by my footstool;"
59,2,4,"haven't you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?"
59,2,5,"Listen, my beloved brothers. Did not God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him?"
59,2,6,"But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the courts?"
59,2,7,"Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?"
59,2,8,"However, if you fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well."
59,2,9,"But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors."
59,2,10,"For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all."
59,2,11,"For he who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not commit murder. Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law."
59,2,12,"So speak, and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom."
59,2,13,"For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment."
59,2,14,"What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him?"
59,2,15,"And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,"
59,2,16,"and one of you tells them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled; and yet you did not give them the things the body needs, what good is it?"
59,2,17,"Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself."
59,2,18,"Yes, a man will say, You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without works, and I by my works will show you my faith."
59,2,19,"You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and shudder."
59,2,20,"But do you want to know, foolish man, that faith apart from works is dead?"
59,2,21,"Wasn't Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?"
59,2,22,"You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected;"
59,2,23,"and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness; and he was called the friend of God."
59,2,24,"You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith."
59,2,25,"In like manner was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?"
59,2,26,"For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead."
59,3,1,"Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment."
59,3,2,"For in many things we all stumble. If anyone does not stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also."
59,3,3,"Now if we put bits into the horses' mouths so that they may obey us, we guide their whole body."
59,3,4,"Behold, the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires."
59,3,5,"So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!"
59,3,6,"And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by hell."
59,3,7,"For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and thing in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind."
59,3,8,"But nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison."
59,3,9,"With it we bless our"
59,3,10,"Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so."
59,3,11,"Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?"
59,3,12,"Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Nor is salt water able to produce sweet."
59,3,13,"Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom."
59,3,14,"But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast and do not lie against the truth."
59,3,15,"This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic."
59,3,16,"For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed."
59,3,17,"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, without hypocrisy."
59,3,18,"Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace."
59,4,1,"Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Do not they come from your pleasures that war in your members?"
59,4,2,"You lust, and do not have. You kill, covet, and cannot obtain. You fight and make war. You do not have, because you do not ask."
59,4,3,"You ask, and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it for your pleasures."
59,4,4,"You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God."
59,4,5,"Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, The Spirit which He made to dwell in us yearns jealously?"
59,4,6,"But He gives more grace. Therefore it says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
59,4,7,"Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
59,4,8,"Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded."
59,4,9,"Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom."
59,4,10,"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you."
59,4,11,"Do not speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge."
59,4,12,"Only one is the lawgiver and judge, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?"
59,4,13,"Come now, you who say, Today or tomorrow let us go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit."
59,4,14,"Whereas you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away."
59,4,15,"For you ought to say, If the"
59,4,16,"But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil."
59,4,17,"To him therefore who knows to do good, and does not do it, to him it is sin."
59,5,1,"Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming on you."
59,5,2,"Your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten."
59,5,3,"Your gold and your silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you, and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up your treasure in the last days."
59,5,4,"Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the"
59,5,5,"You have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure. You have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter."
59,5,6,"You have condemned, you have murdered the righteous one. He does not resist you."
59,5,7,"Be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and late rain."
59,5,8,"You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near."
59,5,9,"Do not grumble, brothers, against one another, so that you won't be judged. Behold, the judge stands at the door."
59,5,10,"Take, brothers, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord."
59,5,11,"Behold, we call them blessed who endured. You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the"
59,5,12,"But above all things, my brothers, do not swear, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but let your yes be yes, and your no, no; so that you do not fall under judgment."
59,5,13,"Is any among you suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praises."
59,5,14,"Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord,"
59,5,15,"and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. If he has committed sins, he will be forgiven."
59,5,16,"Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective."
59,5,17,"Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months."
59,5,18,"He prayed again, and the sky gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit."
59,5,19,"My brothers, if any among you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back,"
59,5,20,"let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins."
60,1,1,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the Diaspora in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"
60,1,2,"according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood: Grace to you and peace be multiplied."
60,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,"
60,1,4,"to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that does not fade away, reserved in Heaven for you,"
60,1,5,"who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."
60,1,6,"Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been put to grief in various trials,"
60,1,7,"that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ-"
60,1,8,"whom not having seen you love; in whom, though now you do not see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory-"
60,1,9,"receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls."
60,1,10,"Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,"
60,1,11,"searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that would follow them."
60,1,12,"To them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, they ministered these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into."
60,1,13,"Therefore, prepare your minds for action, be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ-"
60,1,14,"as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance,"
60,1,15,"but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior;"
60,1,16,"because it is written, You shall be holy; for I am holy."
60,1,17,"If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man's work, pass the time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear:"
60,1,18,"knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers,"
60,1,19,"but with precious blood, as of a faultless and pure lamb, the blood of Christ;"
60,1,20,"who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of times for your sake,"
60,1,21,"who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead, and gave Him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God."
60,1,22,"Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth in sincere brotherly affection, love one another from a pure heart fervently:"
60,1,23,"having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding Word of God."
60,1,24,"For,All flesh is like grass,and all it's glory like the flower in the grass.The grass withers, and its flower falls;"
60,1,25,"but the word of the"
60,2,1,"Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,"
60,2,2,"as newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,"
60,2,3,"if indeed you have tasted that the"
60,2,4,"coming to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God, precious."
60,2,5,"You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
60,2,6,"Because it is contained in Scripture,Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, and precious:He who believes in him will not be disappointed."
60,2,7,"For you who believe therefore is the honor, but for those who do not believe,The stone which the builders rejected,has become the chief cornerstone,"
60,2,8,"and,a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense.For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed."
60,2,9,"But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:"
60,2,10,"who in time past were no people, but now are God's people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy."
60,2,11,"Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;"
60,2,12,"having good behavior among the nations, so in that of which they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they see, glorify God in the day of visitation."
60,2,13,"Subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether to the king, as supreme;"
60,2,14,"or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do well."
60,2,15,"For this is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:"
60,2,16,"as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God."
60,2,17,"Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king."
60,2,18,"Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked."
60,2,19,"For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward God."
60,2,20,"For what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating? But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God."
60,2,21,"For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow his steps,"
60,2,22,"who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth."
60,2,23,"Who, when he was cursed, did not curse back. When he suffered, did not threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously;"
60,2,24,"who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by his stripes you were healed."
60,2,25,"For you were going astray like sheep; but now have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls."
60,3,1,"In like manner, wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; so that, even if any do not obey the Word, they may be won by the behavior of their wives without a word;"
60,3,2,"seeing your pure behavior in fear."
60,3,3,"Let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on fine clothing;"
60,3,4,"but in the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God very precious."
60,3,5,"For this is how the holy women before, who hoped in God also adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:"
60,3,6,"as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children you now are, if you do well, and are not put in fear by any terror."
60,3,7,"You husbands, in like manner, live with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman, as to the weaker vessel, as being also joint heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers may not be hindered."
60,3,8,"Finally, be all like-minded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, humble,"
60,3,9,"not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but instead blessing; because to this were you called, that you may inherit a blessing."
60,3,10,"For,He who would love life,and see good days,let him keep his tongue from evil,and his lips from speaking deceit."
60,3,11,"Let him turn away from evil, and do good.Let him seek peace, and pursue it."
60,3,12,"For the eyes of the"
60,3,13,"Now who is he who will harm you, if you become zealous of that which is good?"
60,3,14,"But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. Do not fear what they fear, neither be troubled."
60,3,15,"But sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with humility and fear:"
60,3,16,"having a good conscience; so that when they speak evil against you, they may be put to shame who slander your good manner of life in Christ."
60,3,17,"For it is better, if it is God's will, that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil."
60,3,18,"Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;"
60,3,19,"in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,"
60,3,20,"who before were disobedient, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, while the ship was being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water."
60,3,21,"This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you-not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,"
60,3,22,"who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him."
60,4,1,"Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;"
60,4,2,"that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God."
60,4,3,"For enough time in the past has been spent doing the will of the Gentiles, and having walked in lewdness, lusts, drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries."
60,4,4,"They think it is strange that you do not run with them into the same excess of riot, blaspheming:"
60,4,5,"who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead."
60,4,6,"For to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh, but live as to God in the spirit."
60,4,7,"But the end of all things is near. Therefore be of sound mind, self-controlled, and sober in prayer."
60,4,8,"Above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves, for love covers a multitude of sins."
60,4,9,"Be hospitable to one another without grumbling."
60,4,10,"As each has received a gift, employ it in serving one another, as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms."
60,4,11,"If anyone speaks, let it be as it were the very words of God. If anyone serves, let it be as of the strength which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen."
60,4,12,"Beloved, do not be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you, to test you, as though a strange thing happened to you."
60,4,13,"But because you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy."
60,4,14,"If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you."
60,4,15,"For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil doer, or a meddler in other men's matters."
60,4,16,"But if one of you suffers for being a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this name."
60,4,17,"For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God. If it begins first with us, what will happen to those who do not obey the Good News of God?"
60,4,18,"If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner?"
60,4,19,"Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful Creator."
60,5,1,"Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed."
60,5,2,"Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to God; not for dishonest gain, but willingly;"
60,5,3,"neither as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock."
60,5,4,"When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away."
60,5,5,"Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility, towards one another; for God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
60,5,6,"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;"
60,5,7,"casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you."
60,5,8,"Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour."
60,5,9,"Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings."
60,5,10,"And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen and establish you."
60,5,11,"To him be the power forever. Amen."
60,5,12,"Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it!"
60,5,13,"She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you; and so does Mark, my son."
60,5,14,"Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ."
61,1,1,"Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:"
61,1,2,"Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,"
61,1,3,"seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue;"
61,1,4,"by which he has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust."
61,1,5,"Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge;"
61,1,6,"and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness;"
61,1,7,"and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly affection, love."
61,1,8,"For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
61,1,9,"For he who lacks these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins."
61,1,10,"Therefore, brothers, be more diligent to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never stumble."
61,1,11,"For thus you will be richly supplied with the entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."
61,1,12,"Therefore I will be ready always to remind you of these things, though you know them, and are established in the present truth."
61,1,13,"I think it right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you;"
61,1,14,"knowing that the putting off of my tent comes swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me."
61,1,15,"Yes, I will make every effort that you may always be able to remember these things even after my departure."
61,1,16,"For we did not follow cunningly devised tales, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
61,1,17,"For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
61,1,18,"We heard this voice come out of heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain."
61,1,19,"We have the more sure word of prophecy; and you do well that you heed it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the morning star arises in your hearts:"
61,1,20,"knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation."
61,1,21,"For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spoke from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit."
61,2,1,"But false prophets also arose among the people, as false teachers will also be among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction."
61,2,2,"Many will follow their immoral ways, and as a result, the way of the truth will be maligned."
61,2,3,"In covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words: whose sentence now from of old does not linger, and their destruction is not asleep."
61,2,4,"For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them down to the lower parts of hell, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved for judgment;"
61,2,5,"and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a proclaimer of righteousness, when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly;"
61,2,6,"and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly;"
61,2,7,"and delivered righteous Lot, who was very distressed by the lustful life of the wicked"
61,2,8,"(for that righteous man dwelling among them, was tormented in his righteous soul from day to day with seeing and hearing lawless deeds):"
61,2,9,"the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment;"
61,2,10,"but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise authority. Daring, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries;"
61,2,11,"whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord."
61,2,12,"But these, as unreasoning creatures, born natural animals to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant, will in their destroying surely be destroyed,"
61,2,13,"suffering the penalty as the wages of evil; people who count it pleasure to revel in the daytime, spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceit while they feast with you;"
61,2,14,"having eyes full of adultery, and who cannot cease from sin; enticing unsettled souls; having a heart trained in greed; children of cursing;"
61,2,15,"forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of wrongdoing;"
61,2,16,"but he was rebuked for his own disobedience. A mute donkey spoke with a man's voice and stopped the madness of the prophet."
61,2,17,"These are wells without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved."
61,2,18,"For, uttering great swelling words of emptiness, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by licentiousness, those who barely escape from those who live in error;"
61,2,19,"promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for a man is brought into bondage by whoever overcomes him."
61,2,20,"For if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in it and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first."
61,2,21,"For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them."
61,2,22,"It has happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog turns to his own vomit again, and the sow that has washed to wallowing in the mire."
61,3,1,"This is now, beloved, the second letter that I have written to you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by reminding you;"
61,3,2,"that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles:"
61,3,3,"knowing this first, that in the last days scoffers will come, mocking and walking after their own lusts,"
61,3,4,"and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? For, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."
61,3,5,"For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth formed out of water and amid water, by the word of God;"
61,3,6,"by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished."
61,3,7,"But the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men."
61,3,8,"But do not forget this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."
61,3,9,"The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness; but is patient with you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
61,3,10,"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are in it will be disclosed."
61,3,11,"Therefore since all these things will be destroyed like this, what kind of people ought you to be in holy living and godliness,"
61,3,12,"looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, which will cause the burning heavens to be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?"
61,3,13,"But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells."
61,3,14,"Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for these things, be diligent to be found in peace, without blemish and blameless in his sight."
61,3,15,"Regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you;"
61,3,16,"as also in all of his letters, speaking in them of these things. In those, there are some things that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unsettled twist, as they also do to the other Scriptures, to their own destruction."
61,3,17,"You therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand, beware, lest being carried away with the error of the wicked, you fall from your own steadfastness."
61,3,18,"But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and forever. Amen."
62,1,1,"That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life"
62,1,2,"(and the life was revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the life, the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us);"
62,1,3,"that which we have seen and heard we declare to you also, that you also may have fellowship with us. Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ."
62,1,4,"And we write these things, that our joy may be fulfilled."
62,1,5,"This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
62,1,6,"If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not tell the truth."
62,1,7,"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin."
62,1,8,"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."
62,1,9,"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
62,1,10,"If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."
62,2,1,"My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin. If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous."
62,2,2,"And he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world."
62,2,3,"This is how we know that we know him: if we keep his commandments."
62,2,4,"One who says, I know him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."
62,2,5,"But whoever keeps his word, God's love has truly been perfected in him. This is how we know that we are in him:"
62,2,6,"he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked."
62,2,7,"Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard."
62,2,8,"Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines."
62,2,9,"He who says he is in the light and hates his brother, is in the darkness even until now."
62,2,10,"He who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in him."
62,2,11,"But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes."
62,2,12,"I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake."
62,2,13,"I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.I write to you, little children, because you know the Father."
62,2,14,"I have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one."
62,2,15,"Do not love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love is not in him."
62,2,16,"For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not the Father's, but is the world's."
62,2,17,"The world is passing away with its lusts, but he who does God's will remains forever."
62,2,18,"Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that the Anti-Christ is coming, even now many anti-Christs have arisen. By this we know that it is the final hour."
62,2,19,"They went out from us, but they did not belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us."
62,2,20,"You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all have knowledge."
62,2,21,"I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth."
62,2,22,"Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the Anti-Christ, he who denies the Father and the Son."
62,2,23,"Whoever denies the Son, the same does not have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also."
62,2,24,"As for you, let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning. If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son, and in the Father."
62,2,25,"This is the promise which he promised us, the eternal life."
62,2,26,"These things I have written to you concerning those who would lead you astray."
62,2,27,"As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do not need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you remain in him."
62,2,28,"Now, little children, remain in him, that when he appears, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming."
62,2,29,"If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone also who practices righteousness is born of him."
62,3,1,"Behold, how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God; and such we are. For this cause the world does not know us, because it did not know him."
62,3,2,"Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be. We know that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is."
62,3,3,"Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure."
62,3,4,"Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness."
62,3,5,"You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and in him is no sin."
62,3,6,"Whoever remains in him does not sin. Whoever sins hasn't seen him, neither knows him."
62,3,7,"Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous."
62,3,8,"He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To this end the Son of God was revealed, that he might destroy the works of the devil."
62,3,9,"Whoever is born of God does not commit sin, because his seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God."
62,3,10,"In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil. Whoever does not do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who does not love his brother."
62,3,11,"For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;"
62,3,12,"unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous."
62,3,13,"Do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you."
62,3,14,"We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who does not love remains in death."
62,3,15,"Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him."
62,3,16,"By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers."
62,3,17,"But whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against him, how does the love of God remain in him?"
62,3,18,"Little children, let us not love in word only, neither with the tongue only, but in deed and truth."
62,3,19,"And by this we will know that we are of the truth, and persuade our heart before him,"
62,3,20,"because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things."
62,3,21,"Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have boldness toward God;"
62,3,22,"and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight."
62,3,23,"This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded us."
62,3,24,"He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us."
62,4,1,"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world."
62,4,2,"By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,"
62,4,3,"and every spirit who does not confess Jesus is not of God, and this is the spirit of the Anti-Christ, of whom you have heard that it comes. Now it is in the world already."
62,4,4,"You are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world."
62,4,5,"They are of the world. Therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them."
62,4,6,"We are of God. He who knows God listens to us. He who is not of God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error."
62,4,7,"Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God."
62,4,8,"He who does not love does not know God, for God is love."
62,4,9,"By this God's love was revealed in us, that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him."
62,4,10,"In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins."
62,4,11,"Beloved, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another."
62,4,12,"No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us."
62,4,13,"By this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit."
62,4,14,"We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world."
62,4,15,"Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God."
62,4,16,"We know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him."
62,4,17,"In this love has been made perfect among us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, even so are we in this world."
62,4,18,"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment. He who fears is not made perfect in love."
62,4,19,"We love, because he first loved us."
62,4,20,"If a man says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen."
62,4,21,"This commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should also love his brother."
62,5,1,"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Whoever loves the Father also loves the child who is born of him."
62,5,2,"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do his commandments."
62,5,3,"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous."
62,5,4,"For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world: our faith."
62,5,5,"Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?"
62,5,6,"This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth."
62,5,7,"For there are three who testify:"
62,5,8,"the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three agree as one."
62,5,9,"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is God's testimony that he has testified concerning his Son."
62,5,10,"He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son."
62,5,11,"The testimony is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son."
62,5,12,"He who has the Son has the life. He who does not have God's Son does not have the life."
62,5,13,"These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life."
62,5,14,"This is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to us."
62,5,15,"And if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him."
62,5,16,"If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for those who sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death. I do not say that he should make a request concerning this."
62,5,17,"All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death."
62,5,18,"We know that whoever is born of God does not sin, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him."
62,5,19,"We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one."
62,5,20,"We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life."
62,5,21,"Little children, keep yourselves from idols."
63,1,1,"The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;"
63,1,2,"for the truth's sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:"
63,1,3,"Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."
63,1,4,"I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father."
63,1,5,"Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another."
63,1,6,"This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it."
63,1,7,"For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Anti-Christ."
63,1,8,"Watch yourselves, that you do not lose the things which we have accomplished, but that you receive a full reward."
63,1,9,"Whoever goes on and does not remain in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. He who remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son."
63,1,10,"If anyone comes to you, and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not welcome him,"
63,1,11,"for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works."
63,1,12,"Having many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full."
63,1,13,"The children of your chosen sister greet you."
64,1,1,"The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth."
64,1,2,"Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be healthy, even as your soul prospers."
64,1,3,"For I rejoiced greatly, when brothers came and testified about your truth, even as you walk in truth."
64,1,4,"I have no greater joy than this, to hear about my children walking in truth."
64,1,5,"Beloved, you do a faithful work in whatever you accomplish for those who are brothers and strangers."
64,1,6,"They have testified about your love before the church. You will do well to send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God,"
64,1,7,"because for the sake of the Name they went out, taking nothing from the pagans."
64,1,8,"We therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellow workers for the truth."
64,1,9,"I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept what we say."
64,1,10,"Therefore, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words. Not content with this, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and those who would, he forbids and throws out of the church."
64,1,11,"Beloved, do not imitate that which is evil, but that which is good. He who does good is of God. He who does evil hasn't seen God."
64,1,12,"Demetrius has the testimony of all, and of the truth itself; yes, we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true."
64,1,13,"I had many things to write to you, but I am unwilling to write to you with ink and pen;"
64,1,14,"but I hope to see you soon, and we will speak face to face. Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name."
65,1,1,"Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of Jacob, to those who are called, loved by God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:"
65,1,2,"Mercy to you and peace and love be multiplied."
65,1,3,"Beloved, while I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I was constrained to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints."
65,1,4,"For there are certain men who crept in secretly, even those who were long ago written about for this condemnation: ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ."
65,1,5,"Now I desire to remind you, though you already know this, that the"
65,1,6,"Angels who did not keep their first domain, but deserted their own dwelling place, he has kept in everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day."
65,1,7,"Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, having, in the same way as these, given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire."
65,1,8,"Yet in like manner these also in their dreaming defile the flesh, despise authority, and slander celestial beings."
65,1,9,"But Michael, the archangel, when contending with the devil and arguing about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him an abusive condemnation, but said, May the"
65,1,10,"But these speak evil of whatever things they do not know. What they understand naturally, like the creatures without reason, they are destroyed in these things."
65,1,11,"Woe to them! For they went in the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished in Korah's rebellion."
65,1,12,"These are hidden rocky reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you, shepherds who without fear feed themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn leaves without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;"
65,1,13,"wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever."
65,1,14,"About these also Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, Behold, the"
65,1,15,"to execute judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
65,1,16,"These are murmurers and complainers, walking after their lusts (and their mouth speaks proud things), showing respect of persons to gain advantage."
65,1,17,"But you, beloved, remember the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ."
65,1,18,"They said to you that In the last time there will be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts."
65,1,19,"These are they who cause divisions, and are sensual, not having the Spirit."
65,1,20,"But you, beloved, keep building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit."
65,1,21,"Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life."
65,1,22,"On some have compassion, who are in doubt,"
65,1,23,"and some save, snatching them out of the fire, and on some have mercy with fear; hating even the clothing stained by the flesh."
65,1,24,"Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory in great joy,"
65,1,25,"to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen."
66,1,1,"This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant, John,"
66,1,2,"who testified to God's word, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything that he saw."
66,1,3,"Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it, for the time is near."
66,1,4,"John, to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from him who is and who was and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;"
66,1,5,"and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, and washed us from our sins by his blood;"
66,1,6,"and he made us to be a Kingdom, priests to his God and Father; to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen."
66,1,7,"Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, including those who pierced him. All the tribes of the earth will mourn over him. Even so, Amen."
66,1,8,"I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the"
66,1,9,"I John, your brother and partner with you in persecution, Kingdom, and patient endurance in Jesus, was on the island that is called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus."
66,1,10,"I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like a trumpet"
66,1,11,"saying, What you see, write in a scroll and send to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."
66,1,12,"I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. Having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands."
66,1,13,"And among the lampstands was one like a son of man, clothed with a robe reaching down to his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest."
66,1,14,"His head and his hair were white as white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire."
66,1,15,"His feet were like burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace. His voice was like the voice of many waters."
66,1,16,"He had seven stars in his right hand. Out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining at its brightest."
66,1,17,"When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man.He laid his right hand on me, saying, Do not be afraid. I am the first and the last,"
66,1,18,"and the Living one. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. I have the keys of Death and of hell."
66,1,19,"Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will happen hereafter;"
66,1,20,"the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. The seven lampstands are seven churches."
66,2,1,"To the angel of the church in Ephesus write:He who holds the seven stars in his right hand, he who walks among the seven golden lampstands says these things:"
66,2,2,"I know your works, and your toil and perseverance, and that you cannot tolerate evil men, and have tested those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and found them false."
66,2,3,"You have perseverance and have endured for my name's sake, and have not grown weary."
66,2,4,"But I have this against you, that you left your first love."
66,2,5,"Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I am coming to you, and will move your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent."
66,2,6,"But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
66,2,7,"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God."
66,2,8,"To the angel of the church in Smyrna write:The first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life says these things:"
66,2,9,"I know your afflictions and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."
66,2,10,"Do not be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you will have oppression for ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life."
66,2,11,"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes won't be harmed by the second death."
66,2,12,"To the angel of the church in Pergamum write:He who has the sharp two-edged sword says these things:"
66,2,13,"I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is. You hold firmly to my name, and did not deny my faith in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells."
66,2,14,"But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality."
66,2,15,"So you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans likewise."
66,2,16,"Repent therefore, or else I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth."
66,2,17,"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it."
66,2,18,"To the angel of the church in Thyatira write:The Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like burnished brass, says these things:"
66,2,19,"I know your works, your love, faith, service, patient endurance, and that your last works are more than the first."
66,2,20,"But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman, Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. She teaches and seduces my servants to commit sexual immorality, and to eat things sacrificed to idols."
66,2,21,"I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality."
66,2,22,"Behold, I will throw her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression, unless they repent of their works."
66,2,23,"I will kill her children with Death, and all the churches will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts. I will give to each one of you according to your deeds."
66,2,24,"But to you I say, to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as do not have this teaching, who do not know what some call 'the deep things of Satan,' to you I say, I am not putting any other burden on you."
66,2,25,"Nevertheless, hold that which you have firmly until I come."
66,2,26,"He who overcomes, and he who keeps my works to the end, to him I will give authority over the nations."
66,2,27,"He will rule them with a rod of iron, shattering them like clay pots; as I also have received of my Father:"
66,2,28,"and I will give him the morning star."
66,2,29,"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
66,3,1,"And to the angel of the church in Sardis write:He who has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars says these things:I know your works, that you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead."
66,3,2,"Wake up, and keep the things that remain, which were about to die, for I have found no works of yours perfected before my God."
66,3,3,"Remember therefore how you have received and heard. Keep it, and repent. If therefore you do not wake up, I will come as a thief, and you won't know what hour I will come to you."
66,3,4,"Nevertheless you have a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments. They will walk with me in white, for they are worthy."
66,3,5,"He who overcomes will be arrayed in white garments, and I will in no way blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels."
66,3,6,"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
66,3,7,"To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:These are the words of the Holy One, the True One, he who has the key of David, he who opens and no one can shut, and who shuts and no one opens:"
66,3,8,"I know your works (behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one can shut), that you have a little power, and kept my word, and did not deny my name."
66,3,9,"Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but lie. Behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you."
66,3,10,"Because you kept my command to endure, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, which is to come on the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth."
66,3,11,"I am coming quickly! Hold firmly that which you have, so that no one takes your crown."
66,3,12,"He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will go out from there no more. I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God, and my own new name."
66,3,13,"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
66,3,14,"To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:The Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Head of God's creation, says these things:"
66,3,15,"I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or hot."
66,3,16,"So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will vomit you out of my mouth."
66,3,17,"Because you say, 'I am rich, and have gotten riches, and have need of nothing;' and do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked;"
66,3,18,"I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, that you may become rich; and white garments, that you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and eye salve to put on your eyes, that you may see."
66,3,19,"As many as I love, I rebuke and discipline. Be zealous therefore, and repent."
66,3,20,"Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him, and will dine with him, and he with me."
66,3,21,"He who overcomes, I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father on his throne."
66,3,22,"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
66,4,1,"After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was one saying, Come up here, and I will show you the things which must happen after this."
66,4,2,"Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne."
66,4,3,"And the one who sat there looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at."
66,4,4,"Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads."
66,4,5,"Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God."
66,4,6,"Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the midst of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind."
66,4,7,"The first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle."
66,4,8,"The four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within. They have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy is the"
66,4,9,"When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,"
66,4,10,"the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns before the throne, saying,"
66,4,11,"Worthy are you, our"
66,5,1,"I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a scroll written inside and on the back, sealed shut with seven seals."
66,5,2,"I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll, and to break its seals?"
66,5,3,"No one in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the scroll, or to look in it."
66,5,4,"And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll, or to look in it."
66,5,5,"One of the elders said to me, Do not weep. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome; he who opens the scroll and its seven seals."
66,5,6,"I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth."
66,5,7,"Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne."
66,5,8,"Now when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints."
66,5,9,"They sang a new song, saying,You are worthy to take the scroll,and to open its seals:for you were killed,and redeemed us for God with your blood,out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,"
66,5,10,"and made them a kingdom and priests to our God,and they will reign on earth."
66,5,11,"I saw, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands;"
66,5,12,"saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb who has been killed to receive the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing!"
66,5,13,"I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying, To him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion, forever and ever!"
66,5,14,"The four living creatures were saying, Amen! The elders fell down and worshiped."
66,6,1,"I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, Come!"
66,6,2,"And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow. A crown was given to him, and he came forth conquering, and to conquer."
66,6,3,"When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come!"
66,6,4,"Another came forth, a fiery red horse. To him who sat on it was given power to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. There was given to him a great sword."
66,6,5,"When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come! And I saw, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand."
66,6,6,"I heard something like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenixes of barley for a denarius! Do not damage the oil and the wine!"
66,6,7,"When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature saying, Come!"
66,6,8,"And behold, a pale horse, and he who sat on it, his name was Death. Hell followed with him. Authority over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, with famine, with death, and by the wild animals of the earth was given to him."
66,6,9,"When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God, and for the testimony which they had."
66,6,10,"They called out with a loud voice, saying, How long, Master, the holy and true, until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"
66,6,11,"A long white robe was given to each of them. They were told that they should rest yet for a little longer, until their fellow servants and their brothers, who would also be killed even as they were, should complete their course."
66,6,12,"I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became as blood."
66,6,13,"The stars of the sky fell to the earth, like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind."
66,6,14,"The sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up. Every mountain and island were moved out of their places."
66,6,15,"The kings of the earth, the princes, the commanding officers, the rich, the strong, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains."
66,6,16,"They told the mountains and the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,"
66,6,17,"for the great day of their wrath has come; and who is able to stand?"
66,7,1,"After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree."
66,7,2,"I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise, having the seal of the living God. He called out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea,"
66,7,3,"saying, Do not harm the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads!"
66,7,4,"I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel:"
66,7,5,"of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand,of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand,of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,"
66,7,6,"of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand,of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand,of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,"
66,7,7,"of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand,of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand,of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,"
66,7,8,"of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand,of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand,of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand."
66,7,9,"After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes, peoples, and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands."
66,7,10,"They shouted with a loud voice, saying, Salvation be to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"
66,7,11,"All the angels were standing around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne, and worshiped God,"
66,7,12,"saying, Amen! Blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and might, be to our God forever and ever! Amen."
66,7,13,"One of the elders answered, saying to me, These who are arrayed in white robes, who are they, and from where did they come?"
66,7,14,"So I said to him, My lord, you know.He said to me, These are the ones who came out of the great tribulation. They washed their robes, and made them white in the Lamb's blood."
66,7,15,"Therefore they are before the throne of God, they serve him day and night in his temple. He who sits on the throne will spread his tabernacle over them."
66,7,16,"They will hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither will the sun beat on them, nor any heat;"
66,7,17,"for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them, and leads them to springs of waters of life. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."
66,8,1,"When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour."
66,8,2,"I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them."
66,8,3,"Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was given to him to offer up, with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar which was before the throne."
66,8,4,"The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand."
66,8,5,"The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth. There followed thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake."
66,8,6,"The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound."
66,8,7,"The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. One third of the earth was burnt up, and one third of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up."
66,8,8,"The second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood,"
66,8,9,"and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died. One third of the ships were destroyed."
66,8,10,"The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters."
66,8,11,"The name of the star is called Wormwood. One third of the waters became wormwood. Many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter."
66,8,12,"The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day would not shine for one third of it, and the night in the same way."
66,8,13,"I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe! Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!"
66,9,1,"The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him."
66,9,2,"He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and smoke went up out of the shaft, like the smoke from a great furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit."
66,9,3,"Then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power."
66,9,4,"They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who do not have God's seal on their foreheads."
66,9,5,"They were given power not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a person."
66,9,6,"In those days people will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them."
66,9,7,"The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like golden crowns, and their faces were like people's faces."
66,9,8,"They had hair like women's hair, and their teeth were like those of lions."
66,9,9,"They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war."
66,9,10,"They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails is their power to harm men for five months."
66,9,11,"They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, he has the name Apollyon."
66,9,12,"The first woe is past. Behold, there are still two woes coming after this."
66,9,13,"The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,"
66,9,14,"saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet, Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!"
66,9,15,"The four angels were freed who had been prepared for this hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill one third of mankind."
66,9,16,"The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million. I heard the number of them."
66,9,17,"Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of lions. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur."
66,9,18,"By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: from the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths."
66,9,19,"For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they harm."
66,9,20,"The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they would not worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk."
66,9,21,"They did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts."
66,10,1,"I saw another mighty angel coming down out of the sky, clothed with a cloud. A rainbow was on his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire."
66,10,2,"He had in his hand a little open scroll. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land."
66,10,3,"He shouted with a loud voice, as a lion roars. When he shouted, the seven thunders uttered their voices."
66,10,4,"When the seven thunders sounded, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from the sky saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders said, and do not write them."
66,10,5,"The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky,"
66,10,6,"and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there will no longer be delay,"
66,10,7,"but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as he declared to his servants, the prophets."
66,10,8,"The voice which I heard from heaven, again speaking with me, said, Go, take the scroll which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land."
66,10,9,"I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little scroll.He said to me, Take it, and eat it up. It will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey."
66,10,10,"I took the little scroll out of the angel's hand, and ate it up. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth. When I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter."
66,10,11,"They told me, You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."
66,11,1,"A reed like a rod was given to me. Someone said, Rise and measure God's temple, and the altar, and those who worship in it."
66,11,2,"Leave out the court which is outside of the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the nations. They will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months."
66,11,3,"I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth."
66,11,4,"These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, standing before the Lord of the earth."
66,11,5,"If anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. If anyone desires to harm them, he must be killed in this way."
66,11,6,"These have the power to shut up the sky, that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy. They have power over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire."
66,11,7,"When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them."
66,11,8,"Their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified."
66,11,9,"From among the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not allow their dead bodies to be placed in a tomb."
66,11,10,"Those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and they will be glad. They will give gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth."
66,11,11,"After the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet. Great fear fell on those who saw them."
66,11,12,"I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, Come up here! They went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them."
66,11,13,"In that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven."
66,11,14,"The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe comes quickly."
66,11,15,"The seventh angel sounded, and great voices in heaven followed, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ. He will reign forever and ever!"
66,11,16,"The twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God's throne, fell on their faces and worshiped God,"
66,11,17,"saying: We give you thanks,"
66,11,18,"The nations were angry, and your wrath came, as did the time for the dead to be judged, and to give your bondservants the prophets, their reward, as well as to the saints, and those who fear your name, to the small and the great; and to destroy those who destroy the earth."
66,11,19,"God's temple that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple. Lightnings, sounds, thunders, an earthquake, and great hail followed."
66,12,1,"A great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars."
66,12,2,"She was with child. She screamed out in pain, laboring to give birth."
66,12,3,"Another sign was seen in heaven. Behold, a great fiery red serpent, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns."
66,12,4,"His tail drew one third of the stars of the sky, and threw them to the earth. The serpent stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child."
66,12,5,"She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron. Her child was caught up to God, and to his throne."
66,12,6,"The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that there they may nourish her one thousand two hundred sixty days."
66,12,7,"There was war in the sky. Michael and his angels made war on the serpent. The serpent and his angels made war."
66,12,8,"They did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any more in heaven."
66,12,9,"The great serpent was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him."
66,12,10,"I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, Now is come the salvation, the power, and the Kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ; for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them before our God day and night."
66,12,11,"They overcame him because of the Lamb's blood, and because of the word of their testimony. They did not love their life, even to death."
66,12,12,"Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you who dwell in them. Woe to the land and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time."
66,12,13,"When the serpent saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child."
66,12,14,"Two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, so that she might be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent."
66,12,15,"The serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream."
66,12,16,"The earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the serpent spewed out of his mouth."
66,12,17,"He stood on the sand of the sea."
66,13,1,"I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names."
66,13,2,"The beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The serpent gave him his power, his throne, and great authority."
66,13,3,"One of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally. His fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth was amazed and followed the beast."
66,13,4,"They worshiped the serpent, because he gave his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?"
66,13,5,"A mouth was given to him speaking proud words and blasphemies. There was given to him authority to act for forty-two months."
66,13,6,"He opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his dwelling, those who dwell in heaven."
66,13,7,"It was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them. Authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation was given to him."
66,13,8,"All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been killed."
66,13,9,"If anyone has an ear, let him hear."
66,13,10,"If anyone has captivity, he will go into captivity. If anyone shall kill with the sword, with the sword he will be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints."
66,13,11,"I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a serpent."
66,13,12,"He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed."
66,13,13,"He performs great signs, even making fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the sight of people."
66,13,14,"He deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs he was granted to do in front of the beast; saying to those who dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who had been wounded by the sword and yet lived."
66,13,15,"It was given to him to give breath to it, to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast could both speak and cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed."
66,13,16,"He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, to be given a mark on their right hands, or on their forehead;"
66,13,17,"and that no one could be able to buy or to sell, unless he has that mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name."
66,13,18,"Here is wisdom. He who has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is six hundred sixty-six."
66,14,1,"4I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him one hundred forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads."
66,14,2,"I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a great thunder. The sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps."
66,14,3,"They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth."
66,14,4,"These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed from among men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb."
66,14,5,"In their mouth was found no lie, for they are blameless."
66,14,6,"I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal Good News to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, tribe, language, and people."
66,14,7,"He said with a loud voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters!"
66,14,8,"Another, a second angel, followed, saying, Babylon the great has fallen, which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality."
66,14,9,"Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead, or on his hand,"
66,14,10,"he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb."
66,14,11,"The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name."
66,14,12,"Here is the patience of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
66,14,13,"I heard the voice from heaven saying, Write, 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.'Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them."
66,14,14,"I looked, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle."
66,14,15,"Another angel came out from the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, Send forth your sickle, and reap; for the hour to reap has come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe!"
66,14,16,"He who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped."
66,14,17,"Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven. He also had a sharp sickle."
66,14,18,"Another angel came out from the altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for it's grapes are fully ripe!"
66,14,19,"The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God."
66,14,20,"The winepress was trodden outside of the city, and blood came out from the winepress, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as one thousand six hundred stadia."
66,15,1,"I saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky: seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them God's wrath is finished."
66,15,2,"I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who overcame the beast, his image, and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God."
66,15,3,"They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,Great and marvelous are your works,"
66,15,4,"Who would not fear you,"
66,15,5,"After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened."
66,15,6,"The seven angels came out of the temple who had the seven plagues, clothed with pure, bright linen, and wearing golden sashes around their chests."
66,15,7,"One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever."
66,15,8,"The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power. No one was able to enter into the temple, until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished."
66,16,1,"I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth!"
66,16,2,"The first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth, and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast, and who worshiped his image."
66,16,3,"The second one poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man. Every living thing in the sea died."
66,16,4,"The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood."
66,16,5,"I heard the angel of the waters saying, You are righteous, who are and who were, you Holy One, because you have judged these things."
66,16,6,"For they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. They deserve this."
66,16,7,"I heard the altar saying, Yes,"
66,16,8,"The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given to him to scorch men with fire."
66,16,9,"People were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory."
66,16,10,"The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was darkened. They gnawed their tongues because of the pain,"
66,16,11,"and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores. They did not repent of their works."
66,16,12,"The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates. Its water was dried up, that the way might be made ready for the kings that come from the sunrise."
66,16,13,"I saw coming out of the mouth of the serpent, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, something like frogs;"
66,16,14,"for they are spirits of demons, performing signs; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty."
66,16,15,"Behold, I come like a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his clothes, so that he does not walk naked, and they see his shame."
66,16,16,"He gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew, Armageddon."
66,16,17,"The seventh poured out his bowl into the air. A loud voice came forth out of the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done!"
66,16,18,"There were lightnings, voices, and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men on the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty."
66,16,19,"The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath."
66,16,20,"Every island fled away, and the mountains were not found."
66,16,21,"Great hailstones, about the weight of a talent, came down out of the sky on people. People blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, for this plague is exceedingly severe."
66,17,1,"One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come here. I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters,"
66,17,2,"with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality, and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality."
66,17,3,"He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored animal, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns."
66,17,4,"The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality."
66,17,5,"And on her forehead a name was written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."
66,17,6,"I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered with great amazement."
66,17,7,"The angel said to me, Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns."
66,17,8,"The beast that you saw was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss and to go into destruction. Those who dwell on the earth and whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel when they see that the beast was, and is not, but is to come."
66,17,9,"Here is the mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits."
66,17,10,"They are seven kings. Five have fallen, the one is, the other has not yet come. When he comes, he must continue a little while."
66,17,11,"The beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes to destruction."
66,17,12,"The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour."
66,17,13,"These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast."
66,17,14,"These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings. They also will overcome who are with him, called and chosen and faithful."
66,17,15,"He said to me, The waters which you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages."
66,17,16,"The ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the prostitute, and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her utterly with fire."
66,17,17,"For God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind, and to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished."
66,17,18,"The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth."
66,18,1,"After these things, I saw another angel coming down out of the sky, having great authority. The earth was illuminated with his glory."
66,18,2,"He shouted with a mighty voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and she has become a habitation of demons, a cage of every unclean spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird!"
66,18,3,"For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality, the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury."
66,18,4,"I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that you have no participation in her sins, and that you do not receive of her plagues,"
66,18,5,"for her sins have reached to the sky, and God has remembered her iniquities."
66,18,6,"Return to her just as she returned, and repay her double as she did, and according to her works. In the cup which she mixed, mix to her double."
66,18,7,"However much she glorified herself, and grew wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning. For she says in her heart, 'I sit a queen, and am no widow, and will in no way see mourning.'"
66,18,8,"Therefore in one day her plagues will come: death, mourning, and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire; for the"
66,18,9,"The kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her, will weep and wail over her, when they look at the smoke of her burning,"
66,18,10,"standing far away for the fear of her torment, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For your judgment has come in one hour.'"
66,18,11,"The merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise any more;"
66,18,12,"merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all expensive wood, every vessel of ivory, every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;"
66,18,13,"and cinnamon, spice, incense, perfume, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, slaves and human lives."
66,18,14,"The fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to you, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you, and you will find them no more at all."
66,18,15,"The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand far away for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;"
66,18,16,"saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, she who was dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls!"
66,18,17,"For in an hour such great riches are made desolate.' Every shipmaster, and everyone who sails anywhere, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood far away,"
66,18,18,"and exclaimed as they looked at the smoke of her burning, saying, 'What is like the great city?'"
66,18,19,"They cast dust on their heads, and shouting, weeping and mourning, saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her great wealth!' For in one hour is she made desolate."
66,18,20,"Rejoice over her, O heaven, you saints, apostles, and prophets; for God has judged your judgment on her."
66,18,21,"A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down, and will be found no more at all."
66,18,22,"The voice of harpists, minstrels, flute players, and trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you. No craftsman, of whatever craft, will be found any more at all in you. The sound of a mill will be heard no more at all in you."
66,18,23,"The light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you. The voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you; for your merchants were the princes of the earth; for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived."
66,18,24,"In her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on the earth."
66,19,1,"After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah! Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God:"
66,19,2,"for true and righteous are his judgments. For he has judged the great prostitute, who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand."
66,19,3,"A second said, Hallelujah! Her smoke goes up forever and ever."
66,19,4,"The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, Amen! Hallelujah!"
66,19,5,"A voice came forth from the throne, saying, Give praise to our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, the small and the great!"
66,19,6,"I heard something like the voice of a great multitude, and like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah! For the"
66,19,7,"Let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let us give the glory to him. For the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready."
66,19,8,"It was given to her that she would array herself in bright, pure, fine linen: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints."
66,19,9,"He said to me, Write, 'Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.' He said to me, These are true words of God."
66,19,10,"I fell down before his feet to worship him. He said to me, Look! Do not do it! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy."
66,19,11,"I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it is called Faithful and True. In righteousness he judges and makes war."
66,19,12,"His eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head are many crowns. He had a name written which no one knows but he himself."
66,19,13,"He is clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood. His name is called The Word of God."
66,19,14,"The armies which are in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in white, pure, fine linen."
66,19,15,"Out of his mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it he should strike the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod. He treads the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty."
66,19,16,"He has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND"
66,19,17,"I saw an angel standing in the sun. He shouted with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the sky, Come! Be gathered together to the great supper of God,"
66,19,18,"that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, and small and great."
66,19,19,"I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse, and against his army."
66,19,20,"The beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who worked the signs in his sight, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur."
66,19,21,"The rest were killed with the sword of him who sat on the horse, the sword which came forth out of his mouth. All the birds were filled with their flesh."
66,20,1,"I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand."
66,20,2,"He seized the serpent, the old snake, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,"
66,20,3,"and cast him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were finished. After this, he must be freed for a short time."
66,20,4,"I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as did not worship the beast nor his image, and did not receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand. They lived, and reigned with Christ for a thousand years."
66,20,5,"The rest of the dead did not live until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection."
66,20,6,"Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over these, the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with him one thousand years."
66,20,7,"And after the thousand years, Satan will be released from his prison,"
66,20,8,"and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea."
66,20,9,"They went up over the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints, and the beloved city. Fire came down out of heaven and devoured them."
66,20,10,"The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are also. They will be tormented day and night forever and ever."
66,20,11,"I saw a great white throne, and him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. There was found no place for them."
66,20,12,"I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and they opened books. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works."
66,20,13,"The sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and hell gave up the dead who were in them. They were judged, each one according to his works."
66,20,14,"Death and hell were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire."
66,20,15,"If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire."
66,21,1,"I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away, and the sea is no more."
66,21,2,"I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready like a bride adorned for her husband."
66,21,3,"I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, Behold, God's dwelling is with people, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them."
66,21,4,"He will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; neither will there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more. The first things have passed away."
66,21,5,"He who sits on the throne said, Behold, I am making all things new. He said, Write, for these words are faithful and true."
66,21,6,"He said to me, It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give freely to him who is thirsty from the spring of the water of life."
66,21,7,"He who overcomes, I will give him these things. I will be his God, and he will be my son."
66,21,8,"But for the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death."
66,21,9,"One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, full of the seven last plagues came, and he spoke with me, saying, Come here. I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."
66,21,10,"He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,"
66,21,11,"having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, as if it was a jasper stone, clear as crystal;"
66,21,12,"having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel."
66,21,13,"On the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates."
66,21,14,"The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
66,21,15,"He who spoke with me had for a measure, a golden reed, to measure the city, its gates, and its wall."
66,21,16,"The city lies foursquare, and its length is as great as its breadth. He measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand stadia. Its length, breadth, and height are equal."
66,21,17,"Its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits, by the measure of a man, that is, of an angel."
66,21,18,"The construction of its wall was jasper. The city was pure gold, like pure glass."
66,21,19,"The foundations of the city's wall were adorned with all kinds of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;"
66,21,20,"the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; and the twelfth, amethyst."
66,21,21,"The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each one of the gates was made of one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass."
66,21,22,"I saw no temple in it, for the"
66,21,23,"The city has no need for the sun, neither of the moon, to shine, for the very glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb."
66,21,24,"The nations will walk in its light. The kings of the earth bring their splendor into it."
66,21,25,"Its gates will in no way be shut by day (for there will be no night there),"
66,21,26,"and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it so that they may enter."
66,21,27,"There will in no way enter into it anything profane, or one who causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life."
66,22,1,"He showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,"
66,22,2,"in the middle of its street. On this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."
66,22,3,"There will be no curse any more. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants serve him."
66,22,4,"They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads."
66,22,5,"There will no longer be any night, and they need no lamp light; for the"
66,22,6,"He said to me, These words are faithful and true. The"
66,22,7,"Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book."
66,22,8,"Now I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things."
66,22,9,"He said to me, See you do not do it! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers, the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God."
66,22,10,"He said to me, Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near."
66,22,11,"He who acts unjustly, let him act unjustly still. He who is filthy, let him be filthy still. He who is righteous, let him do righteousness still. He who is holy, let him be holy still."
66,22,12,"Behold, I come quickly. My reward is with me, to repay to each man according to his work."
66,22,13,"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End."
66,22,14,"Blessed are they who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city."
66,22,15,"Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood."
66,22,16,"I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David; the Bright and Morning Star."
66,22,17,"The Spirit and the bride say, Come! He who hears, lethim say, Come! He who is thirsty, let him come. He who desires, let him take the water of life freely."
66,22,18,"I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book."
66,22,19,"If anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book."
66,22,20,"He who testifies these things says, Yes, I come quickly.Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!"
66,22,21,"The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all."
