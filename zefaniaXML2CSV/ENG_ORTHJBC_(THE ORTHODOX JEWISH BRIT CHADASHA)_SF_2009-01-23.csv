40,8,31,"And the shedim begged Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying,If you cast us out, send us into the herd of chazirim."
40,8,32,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Go away!  So the shedim, coming out, went away into the chazirim. And--hinei!--all the herd of chazirim rushed down the bank into the lake, and they perished in the water."
40,8,33,"And the herdsmen of the chazirim fled, and, having gone away into the town, they told the whole story of what had happened to the men possessed by shedim."
40,8,34,"And--hinei!--the whole town came out to meet Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and seeing him, they begged him to depart from their area."

40,9,10,"And it came about that while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was sitting bimesibba"
40,9,11,"When the Perushim saw this, they were saying to Moshiach's talmidim, Why does your Rebbe eat with the mochesim and the chote'im?"
40,9,12,"But when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach heard this, he said, It is not the bari'im"
40,9,13,"Go and learn what this means: CHESED CHAFATZTI V'LO ZEVACH"
40,9,14,"Then Yochanan's talmidim approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, Why do we and the Perushim often undergo tzomot"
40,9,15,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Surely the Bnei haChuppah"
40,9,16,"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results."
40,9,17,"Neither do men put yayin chadash"
40,9,18,"While Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was speaking these things to them--hinei--one of the nichbadim"
40,9,19,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach arose and, with his talmidim, followed him."
40,9,20,"And--hinei!--an isha"
40,9,21,"For she was saying to herself, If only I might touch his garment, I will receive refu'ah"
40,9,22,"Turning and seeing her, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Chazak, bat"
40,9,23,"And having come into the bais"
40,9,24,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, Go away! For the yaldah"
40,9,25,"But when the crowd had been put outside, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went in and took the yaldah by the hand and the yaldah was made to stand up alive."
40,9,26,"And this shema"
40,9,27,"And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went on from there, two iverim"
40,9,28,"And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach entered the bais"
40,9,29,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach touched their eyes, saying, According to your emunah, let it be done for you."
40,9,30,"And their eyes were opened. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sternly warned them, saying, See to it that no one knows!"
40,9,31,"But having gone out, they made Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach known in that entire district."
40,9,32,"After they had departed, the people brought to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach a mute man who was possessed by shedim."
40,9,33,"And when the shedim had been cast out by Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, the mute man spoke.  And the multitudes marveled, saying,  Never was anything like this seen in eretz-Yisroel!"
40,9,34,"But the Perushim said, It was by the Sar HaShedim"
40,9,35,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went about all the towns and villages exercising the ministry of moreh"
40,9,36,"And looking out on the multitudes, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach felt rachamanut"
40,9,37,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to his talmidim, The katzir"
40,9,38,"Therefore, offer tefillos to the Adon HaKatzir"
40,10,1,"And summoning his Shneym Asar"
40,10,2,"Now of the Shneym Asar Shluchim, the names are these: first, Shimon, the one being called Kefa, and Andrew his brother, Ya'akov Ben-Zavdai and Yochanan his brother,"
40,10,3,"Philippos and Bar-Talmai, T'oma and Mattityahu the moches, Ya'akov Bar-Chalfai and Taddai,"
40,10,4,"Shimon the Zealot and Yehudah from K'riot, who betrayed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH GIVES S'MICHAH COMMISSIONING TO THE SHNEYM ASAR"
40,10,5,"These Shneym Asar"
40,10,6,"but go rather to the Seh Oveid HaBeth Yisroel"
40,10,7,"And, while going, preach that the Malchut HaShomayim is imminent and miyad."
40,10,8,"Heal the cholim, raise the mesim"
40,10,9,"Take neither gold nor silver nor copper for your money-belts,"
40,10,10,"nor a beggar's sack for the road nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff, for the oseh hamelachah"
40,10,11,"And into whichever town or shtetl you enter, inquire who in it is a ben chayil"
40,10,12,"And when you enter into the bais"
40,10,13,"And if indeed the bais is a bais chayil"
40,10,14,"And whoever neither receives you nor listens to your divrei [Moshiach], as you are leaving and as you go outside of that bais"
40,10,15,"Omein, I say to you, it will be more tolerable on Yom HaDin"
40,10,16,"Hinei!  I send you as kevesim"
40,10,17,"And beware of bnei Adam, for they will deliver you up to the sanhedriyot"
40,10,18,"And before moshelim"
40,10,19,"But when they deliver you up, do not be of a LEV ROGEZ"
40,10,20,"For you are not the ones speaking, but the Ruach Avichem"
40,10,21,"And brother will deliver up to death his own brother, even an abba his own yeled.  And yeladim will stand up against their horim"
40,10,22,"And you will be under the sinas chinam"
40,10,23,"But when they persecute you in one city, flee to the other; for omein, I say to you, by no means will you complete the arim"
40,10,24,"A talmid is not above his Rebbe nor an eved"
40,10,25,"It is enough for the talmid that he be as his Rebbe, and the eved as his Ba'al Bayit. If they called the Ba'al Bayit"
40,10,26,"Therefore, do not fear them; for nothing has been veiled which will not be unveiled; and nothing has been hidden which will not be made known."
40,10,27,"What I say to you in the choshech"
40,10,28,"And do not fear those who kill the basar"
40,10,29,"Are not two sparrows sold for the least valuable copper coin?  And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from Avichem!"
40,10,30,"But, as far as you are concerned, even the hairs of your rosh have been numbered."
40,10,31,"Therefore, al ta'arotz"
40,10,32,"Therefore, everyone who shall declare publicly the Ani Ma'amin of me [as Moshiach], before bnei haAdam, I will make hoda'ah"
40,10,33,"But everyone who makes hakhchashah"
40,10,34,"Do not think that I have come to bring shalom al ha'aretz"
40,10,35,"For I came to divide a man against his Av, and a bat against her Em, and a kallah"
40,10,36,"And the OIYVEI ISH ANSHEI VEITOH"
40,10,37,"The one who has more ahavah"
40,10,38,"The one who does not take up his aitz shel hinnazrut"
40,10,39,"The one who has found his nefesh will lose it; the one who has lost his nefesh for my sake [lema'an Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach] will find it.                                                     REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND THE SACHAR FROM HASHEM"
40,10,40,"The one who gives the kabbalat panim"
40,10,41,"The one who gives the Baruch Haba to a navi in the name of a navi will receive the sachar of a navi, and the one who gives the Baruch Haba to a tzaddik in the name of a tzaddik will receive the sachar of a tzaddik."
40,10,42,"And whoever in the name of a talmid [of Moshiach] gives only a cup of cold water to one of these little ones [the least of the talmidim of Moshiach], omein, I say to you, he will by no means lose his sachar"
40,11,1,"And it came about when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach finished giving commands to his Shneym Asar Talmidim, he moved on from there, exercising the ministry of moreh"
40,11,2,"Now when Yochanan, in the beit hasohor"
40,11,3,"They asked him, Tell us. Are you Hu HaBa*"
40,11,4,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered them, saying, Go give the shema"
40,11,5,"the iverim"
40,11,6,"Ashrey"
40,11,7,"As they were leaving, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to speak to the multitudes about Yochanan, What did you go out into the midbar"
40,11,8,"What did you go out to see?  Someone shtats in appearance attired in soft raiment? Hinei, the ones wearing soft raiment are in houses of melachim"
40,11,9,"But what did you go out to see?  A Navi?  Ken, I tell you. And one greater than a Navi."
40,11,10,"This is he about whom it has been written, HINNENI SHOLEIACH MALACHI"
40,11,11,"Omein, I say to you, of those born of women, there has not appeared one greater than Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva, yet the person with the least chashivut"
40,11,12,"From the days of Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva until now, the Malchut HaShomayim has been under violent attack and the violent seize it with coersion."
40,11,13,"For all the Nevi'im and the Torah prophesied until Yochanan."
40,11,14,"And, if you are willing to accept it, he is the Eliyahu, who is to come [MALACHI 3:23]."
40,11,15,"The one having ears, let him hear."
40,11,16,"But to what will I compare this generation?  It is like yeladim sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to one another,"
40,11,17,"`We played the chalil"
40,11,18,"For Yochanan came neither eating nor drinking, and they say,`He has a shed"
40,11,19,"The Ben HaAdam"
40,11,20,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to reproach the arim"
40,11,21,"Oy l'chah"
40,11,22,"Nevertheless, I say to you, it will be more bearable for Tzorand Tzidon than for you on Yom HaDin *"
40,11,23,"And you, K'far-Nachum, were you lifted up as far as Shomayim? You shall be brought down as far as Sheol [Yeshayah 14:13,15]. For if in S'dom were accomplished the gevurot that were accomplished among you, S'dom would have a she'arit"
40,11,24,"Nevertheless, I say to you, it will be more bearable for the land of S'dom on Yom HaDin than for you. IN SPITE OF APICURSIM"
40,11,25,"At that time, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Modeh Ani, Avi, Adon haShomayim v'ha'Aretz,"
40,11,26,"Ken, Avi, for thus it was pleasing in your sight.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSIACH THE BEN YACHID OF HASHEM IS EIDEL"
40,11,27,"All things were given to me by Avi, and no one has da'as"
40,11,28,"Come to me, all you who are burden-weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you Shabbos menuchah"
40,11,29,"Take my ol"
40,11,30,"For my [Moshiach's] ol"
40,12,1,"At that time Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went on Shabbos through the grainfields.  And the talmidim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach were hungry and began to pick the heads of wheat and to eat them."
40,12,2,"But the Perushim, seeing this, said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Hinei! Your talmidim are doing what is asur"
40,12,3,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Have you not read what Dovid HaMelech did when he and those with him were hungry,"
40,12,4,"how he entered into the Beit Hashem and ate the Lechem HaPanim"
40,12,5,"Or have you not read in the Torah that on Shabbos the kohanim in the Beis Hamikdash commit Chillul HaYom HaShabbos"
40,12,6,"But I say to you that something greater than the Beis Hamikdash is here."
40,12,7,"But if you had known what this means, CHESED CHAFATZTI V'LO ZEVACH"
40,12,8,"For the Ben HaAdam"
40,12,9,"And having gone from there, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went into their shul."
40,12,10,"And hinei!  there was a man with a withered hand. And they questioned Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, asking Is it mutar"
40,12,11,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, What man will there be among you, who owns a kevesh"
40,12,12,"Therefore, how much more valuable is a man than a sheep. For this reason, it is mutar"
40,12,13,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to the man, Stretch out your hand. And the man stretched out his hand, and it was restored to health as the other hand."
40,12,14,"But the Perushim went out and took counsel against Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach so that they might destroy him.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE CHOSEN EVED HASHEM"
40,12,15,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, knowing this, departed from there.  And many multitudes followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and he administered refu'ah to them all."
40,12,16,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach warned them that they should not make him manifest."
40,12,17,"This was to fulfill what was spoken through Yeshayah HaNavi, saying,"
40,12,18,"HEN AVDI ETMACH BO, BECHIRI RATZTAH NAFSHI, NATATI RUCHI 'ALAV, MISHPAT LAGOYIM YOTZI"
40,12,19,"LO YITZAK V'LO YISSAH V'LO YASHMI'A BACHUTZ KOLO"
40,12,20,"KANEH RATZUTZ LO YISHBOR UFISHTAH CHEHAH LO YECHABENAH LE-EMET YOTZI MISHPAT"
40,12,21,"And in his Name, HaGoyim will put their tikvah"
40,12,22,"Then a man, blind and mute, who was possessed by shedim, was brought to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach administered refu'ah to him, so that the mute man was able to speak and to see."
40,12,23,"And all the multitudes were amazed and they were saying, Surely this is not the Ben Dovid"
40,12,24,"But, having heard this, the Perushim said, This one does not cast out shedim except by Ba'al-zibbul, the Sar HaShedim"
40,12,25,"But knowing their thoughts, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Every malchut that is divided against itself is made desolate, and every ir"
40,12,26,"And if Hasatan casts out Hasatan, he is divided against himself.  How, therefore, will the Malchut Hasatan stand?"
40,12,27,"And if I by Ba'al-zibbul cast out the shedim, by whom do your banim"
40,12,28,"But if by the Ruach Hakodesh I [Moshiach] cast out the shedim, then upon you the Malchut Hashem has arrived."
40,12,29,"Or how is someone able to enter the Bayit haGibbor"
40,12,30,"The one not with me"
40,12,31,"Therefore, I say to you, every chet"
40,12,32,"And whoever speaks a word against the Ben HaAdam"
40,12,33,"Either make the aitz"
40,12,34,"You yeladim of nechashim, how are you able to l'deber tovot"
40,12,35,"The ish tov"
40,12,36,"But I say to you, that for every careless lashon horah"
40,12,37,"For by your dvarim you will be pronounced tzodek"
40,12,38,"Then some of the Sofrim and Perushim answered Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, Rabbi, we desire to see an ot"
40,12,39,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered them, Dor rah um'naef"
40,12,40,"For just as Yonah was in the belly of the fish SHLOSHAH YAMIM U'SHLOSHAH LAILAH"
40,12,41,"The men of Nineveh will stand up at the Mishpat * with this generation and they will condemn it, for the men of Nineveh made teshuva at the preaching of Yonah, and, hinei, something much greater than Yonah is here."
40,12,42,"The Queen of the South will be made to stand up alive at the Mishpat with this generation and will condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the chochmah of Shlomo and, hinei, something much greater than Solomon is here."
40,12,43,"Now when the ruach hatameh"
40,12,44,"Then it says, Into my haunt I will return from where I came out.  And having come out, it finds the bais standing empty, having been swept and having been put beseder"
40,12,45,"Then it goes and takes along with itself seven other ruchot more evil than itself and, having entered the residence, it sets up house there and the last state of that man has become worse than the first.  Thus it will be with this evil generation also."
40,12,46,"While he was still speaking to the multitudes, hinei, Moshiach's Em and achim stood outside, seeking to speak with him."
40,12,47,"And someone said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Hinei! Your Em and your achim have stood outside seeking to speak with you."
40,12,48,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply to the one speaking with him, Who is my em and who are my achim?"
40,12,49,"And stretching out his hand upon his talmidim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Hinei, my em and my achim."
40,12,50,"For whoever does the ratson"
40,13,1,"On that day, having gone out of the bais, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sat beside the lake."
40,13,2,"And many multitudes gathered together to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach so that he got into a sirah"
40,13,3,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach told them many things in meshalim"
40,13,4,"And  while he sowed, on the one hand, this [seed] fell along the road, and, the birds having come, devoured them."
40,13,5,"And others fell upon the rocky places, where there is not much soil, and immediately it sprouts on account of the lack of the soil's depth."
40,13,6,"And when the shemesh arose, the zera"
40,13,7,"And others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them."
40,13,8,"But others fell on the good ground, and they yielded fruit: the one, one hundred, the other, sixty, the other, thirty."
40,13,9,"The one having ears, let him hear!"
40,13,10,"And, approaching, the talmidim said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Why in meshalim"
40,13,11,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered them, Because to you it has been granted to know the razi'im"
40,13,12,"For whoever has, [more] will be given to him,and he will have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him"
40,13,13,"For this reason in meshalim I am speaking to them, for while seeing they do not see, and [while] hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand."
40,13,14,"And in them is fulfilled the nevu'ah"
40,13,15,"HASHMEIN LEV HA'AM HAZEH V'AZNAV HACHBEID V'EINAV HASHA, PEN YIREH V'EINAV UVE'AZNAV YISHMAH U'LEVAVO YAVIN, V'SHAV N'RAFAH LOH.

40,13,16,"But ashrey"
40,13,17,"For truly I say to you that many Nevi'im and tzaddikim  desired to see what you see, and they did not see [it], and to hear what you hear, and they did not hear it. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH EXPLAINS THE MASHAL OF THE SOWER AND THE MESIRAT NEFESH"
40,13,18,"You, therefore, listen to the mashal of the sower."
40,13,19,"When anyone hears the Dvar HaMalchut and does not understand it, haRah"
40,13,20,"And the zera sown upon the rocky places is the person listening to the Dvar Hashem and immediately with simcha receives it."
40,13,21,"Yet he has no root in himself but is short-lived, and when ES TZARAH * comes or persecution on account of the Dvar Hashem, immediately he ceases being a ma'amin Meshichi"
40,13,22,"And the [zera] sown among the thorns is the one hearing the dvar"
40,13,23,"And the zera sown upon the adamah hatovah"
40,13,24,"Another mashal Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach placed before them, saying, The Malchut HaShomayim is like a man sowing zera tov"
40,13,25,"But while men slept, his oyev"
40,13,26,"But when the wheat sprouted and produced p'ri, then the weeds also appeared."
40,13,27,"So the servants of the Ba'al Bayit said to him, `Adoneinu, did you not sow zera tov"
40,13,28,"And he said to them, An oyev did this.  So the servants say to him,`Do you want us to go and pull them all?"
40,13,29,"But he says, No, lest gathering the weeds you should uproot the wheat together with them."
40,13,30,"Permit both to grow together until the katzir"
40,13,31,"Another mashal Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach placed before them, saying, The Malchut HaShomayim is like a mustard seed, which a man, taking, sowed in his field."
40,13,32,"This which is indeed less than all the zera'im"
40,13,33,"Another mashal Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke to them. The Malchut HaShomayim is like se'or"
40,13,34,"All these things Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke in mashalim to the multitudes.  And apart from mashalim Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not speak to them,"
40,13,35,"so that might be fulfilled what was spoken through the Navi, saying, EFT'CHA V'MASHAL PI A'VIAH CHIDOT MINI-KEDEM"
40,13,36,"Then having sent away the multitudes, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came into the bais"
40,13,37,"And answering, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, `The Sower of the zera tov is the Ben HaAdam"
40,13,38,"The field is HaOlam Hazeh.  And the zera tov, the good seed, these are the Bnei HaMalchut, and the weeds, these are the bnei haRah"
40,13,39,"And the Oyev"
40,13,40,"As the weeds are pulled up and gathered and are consumed with Aish"
40,13,41,"The Ben HaAdam"
40,13,42,"And Moshiach's malachim will throw them into the furnace of Aish; there will be weeping and grinding of the teeth."
40,13,43,"Then the tzaddikim will shine as the shemesh in the Malchut of their Father.  The one having ears, let him hear."
40,13,44,"The Malchut HaShomayim is like otzar"
40,13,45,"Again, the Malchut HaShomayim is like a merchant searching for fine pearls."
40,13,46,"And having found one precious pearl, he went away and liquidated everything he had and acquired it."
40,13,47,"Again, the Malchut HaShomayim is like a reshet"
40,13,48,"which, when this reshet"
40,13,49,"Thus it will be at the Kets HaOlam Hazeh.  The malachim will go out and they will separate the resha'im from among the tzaddikim."
40,13,50,"And they will throw the resha'im into the furnace of Aish.  In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40,13,51,"Did you understand all these things? They say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Ken."
40,13,52,"So Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Therefore, every sofer"
40,13,53,"And it came about when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach finished these meshalim, that he went away from there.  TAKING OFFENSE AT REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH"
40,13,54,"And having come into Moshiach's shtetl, he began ministering as a moreh"
40,13,55,"Is this not the ben hanaggar"
40,13,56,"And are not his achayot"
40,13,57,"And they were taking offense at Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, A Navi"
40,13,58,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not accomplish in that place many moftim, because of their lack of emunah and bittachon."
40,14,1,"At that time reports about Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came to the ears of Herod the Tetrarch."
40,14,2,"And he said to his servants, This one is Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva.  He has come up from the Techiyas HaMesim"
40,14,3,"For Herod had Yochanan arrested and bound him and threw him in the beit hasohar"
40,14,4,"For Yochanan kept on saying to him, It is asur"
40,14,5,"And [although] Herod was desiring to kill Yochanan, he feared the crowd, because they considered Yochanan a Navi."
40,14,6,"Now at the yom huledet"
40,14,7,"Herod, therefore, with a shevu'ah"
40,14,8,"So she, having been prompted by her mother, said, Give to me here upon a serving tray the rosh"
40,14,9,"And, although grieving, the king commanded [it] to be given, on account of the shevu'ot"
40,14,10,"And he sent and had Yochanan beheaded in the beit hasohar."
40,14,11,"And the rosh of Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva was brought upon a serving tray, and it was presented to the girl and she presented it to her mother."
40,14,12,"And Yochanan's talmidim approached and carried away the chalal"
40,14,13,"And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach heard [this], he withdrew from there in a sirah"
40,14,14,"And having gone out, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw a great multitude, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach felt rachamanut"
40,14,15,"Now when erev"
40,14,16,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, They have no need to go away. You yourselves give them something to eat."
40,14,17,"But Moshiach's talmidim say to him, We do not have here anything except chamesh"
40,14,18,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Bring them here to me."
40,14,19,"And having commanded the multitudes to recline on the grass and having taken the chamesh loaves and the shnei hadagim, and having looked up to Shomayim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said a beracha over the okhel, and having offered the betzi'at halechem"
40,14,20,"And everyone ate and they were satisfied, and they took away shirayim"
40,14,21,"And the ones eating were about chamesh elafim"
40,14,22,"And immediately Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach compelled the talmidim to board a sirah"
40,14,23,"And having sent away the multitudes, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went up to the mountain by himself to daven. Now when erev had come, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was alone there."
40,14,24,"Now the sirah"
40,14,25,"Now in the fourth watch of the night, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came towards them, walking on the lake."
40,14,26,"But Moshiach's talmidim, having seen him walking on the lake, were terribly shaken, saying, It is a ruach refa'im"
40,14,27,"And immediately Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke to them, saying, Chazak! Ani hu."
40,14,28,"And Kefa said in reply to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni, if it is really you, command me to come to you al p'nei hamayim"
40,14,29,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Boh!  And having gone down from the sirah"
40,14,30,"And seeing the strong wind, Kefa was afraid, and having begun to sink, Kefa cried out, saying, Gevalt! Adoni, hoshieini!"
40,14,31,"And immediately Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having stretched out"
40,14,32,"And as they were going up into the sirah"
40,14,33,"And the ones in the sirah"
40,14,34,"And having crossed over, they came onto the land at Gennesaret."
40,14,35,"And having recognized him, the men of that place sent into all the surrounding region around, and they brought to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach all the cholim,"
40,14,36,"and they were appealing to him that they might touch even the Moshiach's tzitzit on his garment, and all who did, received Moshiach's refu'ah"
40,15,1,"Then Perushim and Sofrim"
40,15,2,"Why do your talmidim transgress the Masoret HaZekenim"
40,15,3,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, in reply to them, said, Why [do] also you transgress the mitzvat Hashem on account of your own masoret"
40,15,4,"For Hashem has said, KABED ES AVICHA V'ES IMMECHA"
40,15,5,"But you say, `Whoever says to his father or his mother, whatever support you might have had from me, [it is] a gift [i.e. korban, dedicated to G-d],`"
40,15,6,"by no means does [anyone who says this] honor his father.  And you nullify the Dvar Hashem on account of your masoret.            REBBE,MELECH HAMOSHIACH REBUKES VAIN AVODAH AND POINTS TO THE SOURCE OF TIFLUT"
40,15,7,"You tzevu'im"
40,15,8,"YA'AN KI NIGASH HAAM HAZEH BEFIV U'VISHFATAV KI-B'DUNI V'LIBO RICHAK MIMENI VA'TEHI YIRA'TAM OTI MITZVAT ANASHIM MELUMADAH (This people with their lips honor Me, but their heart is far away from Me,"
40,15,9,"and in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the mitzvot of men, YESHAYAH 29:13.)"
40,15,10,"And having summoned the multitude, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Listen and understand!"
40,15,11,"It is not the thing entering into the mouth that makes the man tameh"
40,15,12,"Then Moshiach's talmidim approached and say to him, Do you know that the Perushim took offense when they heard [this] word?"
40,15,13,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, in reply, said, Every plant which Avi sh'baShomayim did not plant will be uprooted."
40,15,14,"Leave them. They are blind morei derech"
40,15,15,"And Kefa said in reply to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Explain to us the mashal."
40,15,16,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said,  Are you still devoid of binoh"
40,15,17,"Do you not know that everything which enters into the mouth goes into the stomach and passes into a latrine?"
40,15,18,"But the things coming out from the mouth come out from the lev"
40,15,19,"For out of the lev comes evil makhshavot"
40,15,20,"These are the things making the man tameh, but eating with hands lacking the netilat yadayim"
40,15,21,"And having gone from that place, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach withdrew into the districts of Tzor and Tzidon."
40,15,22,"And--hinei--a woman from Canaan came out from those regions, and was shouting, Have mercy on me, Adoni, Ben Dovid!  my bat"
40,15,23,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not answer her a word.  And Moshiach's talmidim having approached, were asking him, saying, Send her away, for she shouts after us."
40,15,24,"But, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply, I was not sent except to the Seh Oveid HaBeth Yisroel"
40,15,25,"But she came and fell down before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, Adoni, azreini"
40,15,26,"But, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply, It is not good to take the lechem of the Banim and throw it to the kelevim"
40,15,27,"But she said, Ken, Adoni, but even the kelevim eat the crumbs falling from the tish"
40,15,28,"Then, in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to her, O woman, great [is] your emunah.  Let it be done for you as you wish.  And the bat"
40,15,29,"And having passed over from that place, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came beside Lake Kinneret, and having gone up the mountain, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was sitting there."
40,15,30,"And great multitudes approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having with them pisechim"
40,15,31,"The result was that the multitude was astounded, witnessing mute people speaking, cripples made whole, the pisechim"
40,15,32,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having summoned his talmidim, said, I have rachamanut"
40,15,33,"And Moshiach's talmidim say to him, From where bamidbar"
40,15,34,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, How much lechem, how many loaves do you have? And they said, Sheva"
40,15,35,"And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave the command for the multitude to recline on the ground,"
40,15,36,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took the loaves numbering sheva and the dagim, and making a beracha, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach offered the betzi'at halechem"
40,15,37,"And everyone ate and they were satisfied, and the shirayim"
40,15,38,"And the ones eating were arba'at elafim"
40,15,39,"And having sent away the multitudes, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach embarked in the sirah"
40,16,1,"And the Perushim and Tzedukim approached, to test Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, asking him to present them with an ot"
40,16,2,"But in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, When it is erev, you say, `It will be fair weather, for the sky is fiery red.`"
40,16,3,"And in the boker"
40,16,4,"A dor rah um'naef"
40,16,5,"When the Moshiach's talmidim arrived at the other side, they had forgotten to take lechem."
40,16,6,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Take special precaution against the se'or"
40,16,7,"But they began reasoning among themselves, saying, We took no lechem."
40,16,8,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, aware of their makhshavot"
40,16,9,"Do you not yet understand or remember the chamesh loaves of the chamesh elafim, and how many baskets full you took up,"
40,16,10,"or the shevah loaves of the arba'at elafim, and how many large baskets full you took up?"
40,16,11,"How is it that you do not chap"
40,16,12,"Then Moshiach's talmidim understood that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not say to beware of the se'or of the lechem, but of the se'or"
40,16,13,"Now, having arrived in the district of Caesarea Philippi, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began asking his talmidim, saying, Who do men say that the Ben HaAdam is?"
40,16,14,"And Moshiach's talmidim said, Some say `Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva,` and others, `Eliyahu,` but still others, `Yirmeyah or one of the Nevi'im.`"
40,16,15,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, But you, who do you consider me to be?"
40,16,16,"And, Shimon Kefa said in reply, You are the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, the Ben Elohim Chayyim!"
40,16,17,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply to him, Ashrey atah"
40,16,18,"And I also say to you that you are Shimon Kefa [rock] and upon this rock I will build my Kehillah"
40,16,19,"I will give you the maftechot Malchut HaShomayim"
40,16,20,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave the command to his talmidim that they should tell no one that he was the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEGINS TO GIVE THE NEVU'AH"
40,16,21,"From that point he began to explain to his talmidim that it was necessary that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach go to Yerushalayim, and suffer many things from the Zekenim"
40,16,22,"And Kefa took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, Chas v'shalom"
40,16,23,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach turned and said to Kefa, Get behind me, Hasatan!  You are a michshol"
40,16,24,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to his talmidim, If anyone wishes to come after me, let him turn in hinnazrut"
40,16,25,"For whoever wishes to save his nefesh shall lose it; but whoever loses his nefesh on account of me [Moshiach], shall find it."
40,16,26,"For what will a man be benefited if he acquires the whole world and forfeits his nefesh, or what will a man give in exchange for his neshamah?"
40,16,27,"For the Ben HaAdam"
40,16,28,"Omein, I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who shall not taste death until they see the Bias of the Ben HaAdam"
40,17,1,"And after shisha yamim"
40,17,2,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was transfigured * before them, and Moshiach's face shone like the shemesh, and his garments became brilliant like the ohr."
40,17,3,"And--hinei!--there appeared before them Moshe and Eliyahu conferring with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
40,17,4,"And Kefa said in reply to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni, it is good for us to be here.  If you wish, I will make shalosh succot"
40,17,5,"While he was speaking--hinei!--a brightly shining anan"
40,17,6,"And having heard this, the talmidim fell on their faces and were filled with pachad"
40,17,7,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came to them, and touched them, and said, Arise, and do not be afraid."
40,17,8,"And lifting their eyes, they saw no one, except only Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach himself, alone."
40,17,9,"And as Moshiach's talmidim were coming down from the mountain, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave them this command, saying, Tell the mar'eh"
40,17,10,"And Moshiach's talmidim asked him, saying, Why then do the Sofrim say that it is necessary for Eliyahu to come first?"
40,17,11,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply,  Eliyahu does indeed have his Bias"
40,17,12,"But I say to you, that Eliyahu already came, and they did not know him, but did to him whatever they willed"
40,17,13,"Then the Moshiach's talmidim understood that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke to them about Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH HEALS THE BOCHUR POSSESSED BY SHEDIM"
40,17,14,"And when they came to the multitude, a man came up to rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, falling down before him."
40,17,15,"And the man said, Adoni, grant rachamim"
40,17,16,"And I brought him to your talmidim, and they could not give him refu'ah."
40,17,17,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply, O perverted generation without emunah, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to me."
40,17,18,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach rebuked it, and the shed"
40,17,19,"Then the talmidim came to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach privately, and said, Why were we not able to cast it out?"
40,17,20,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, On account of your little emunah, for, omein, I say to you, if you have emunah as a mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, `Move from here,`and it shall be moved; and nothing shall be impossible for you."
40,17,21,"But these kinds, i.e. kinds of mazikim"
40,17,22,"And as they were gathering together in the Galil, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, The Ben HaAdam"
40,17,23,"and they will kill him, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach will undergo the Techiyas HaMesim on the Yom HaShlishi.   And Moshiach's talmidim were deeply moved with agmat nefesh."
40,17,24,"And when they had come to  K'far-Nachum, those who collected the two-drachma tax approached Kefa, and said, Does your rebbe not pay the two-drachma tax?"
40,17,25,"Kefa said, Ken.  And when Kefa came into the bais"
40,17,26,"And upon Kefa's saying, From zarim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to Kefa, Veha raya"
40,17,27,"But, lest we give them offense, go to the yam"
40,18,1,"At that time, the talmidim approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, Who then is greatest in the Malchut HaShomayim?"
40,18,2,"And having called a yeled to himself, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach set him before them,"
40,18,3,"and said, Omein, I say to you, unless you change inwardly and have a complete turn-around and become like yeladim, you shall never enter the Malchut HaShomayim."
40,18,4,"Therefore, whoever humbles himself as this yeled, he is the greatest in the Malchut HaShomayim."
40,18,5,"And whoever receives one such yeled in my Name receives me [Moshiach]."
40,18,6,"But whoever causes a michshol"
40,18,7,"Oy l'Olam"
40,18,8,"And if your hand or your foot causes a michshol for you, cut it off, and throw it from you.  It is better for you to enter Chayyim crippled or as one of the pisechim"
40,18,9,"And if your eye causes a michshol for you, pluck it out and throw it from you.  It is better for you to enter Chayyim one-eyed than, having two eyes, to be cast into the Gehinnom HaAish."
40,18,10,"See to it that you do not look down on one of these little ones, for I say to you that their malachim which are in Shomayim continually behold the face of Avi sh'baShomayim"
40,18,11,"missing fehlt/missing"
40,18,12,"What do you think?  If any man owns a hundred kevasim"
40,18,13,"And if it turns out that he finds it, truly I say to you, he has more simcha"
40,18,14,"Thus it is not the ratson Hashem, the will of your Av sh'baShomayim, that one of these little ones perish.  HOW SIN IS BOUND AND SETTLED IN THE BET DIN OF MOSHIACH'S KEHILLAH IF YOU HAVE A TVIA"
40,18,15,"And if your ach b'Moshiach sins against you, go and reprove him in private, just between the two of you; if he listens to you, you have gained your ach b'Moshiach."
40,18,16,"But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more achim b'Moshiach with you, so that by the PI SHNAYIM SHLOSHAH EDIM"
40,18,17,"But if he refuses to listen to them, speak to the shtiebel kehillah, and if he even refuses to hear the kehillah, let him be to you as the Goy and the moches"
40,18,18,"Omein, I say to you, whatever you bind as asur"
40,18,19,"Again, omein I say to you, that if two of you will be in agreement about anything on ha'aretz that you petition for, it will be done for them by Avi sh'baShomayim."
40,18,20,"For where two or three form a kehillah in my name [Moshiach], there I am in the midst of them.                         *A MASHAL OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ABOUT UNFORGIVENESS"
40,18,21,"Then, having approached, Kefa said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni, how often will my brother sin against me and I will grant to him selicha"
40,18,22,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to Kefa, I do not say to you as many as shevah, but as many as shivim"
40,18,23,"Therefore, the Malchut HaShomayim is like a melech, a king, who wished to settle accounts with his servants."
40,18,24,"And having begun to settle accounts, a debtor owing ten thousand talents was brought to the melech."
40,18,25,"And, as this debtor did not have the means to pay what was owed his adon, the king commanded that he and his wife and children and everything he possessed be sold and the debt repaid."
40,18,26,"Therefore, crying out for rachamim and falling down before him, the servant said, `Have zitzfleisch"
40,18,27,"And out of rachamanut"
40,18,28,"Then the debtor went out and found one of the other fellow servants who happened to owe the debtor one hundred denarii. And seizing and choking the servant, the debtor said, `Repay what you owe me!`"
40,18,29,"And, falling down, the servant said to the debtor,`Have zitzfleisch"
40,18,30,"But the debtor was not willing. Then the debtor went and threw the servant into the beit hasohar"
40,18,31,"Therefore, when the man's fellow servants saw what had taken place, they grieved greatly and they went and reported to their adon all that had taken place."
40,18,32,"Then having summoned the debtor, his adon said to him, `Wicked servant, all that choiv"
40,18,33,"Was it not necessary also for you to have rachamim"
40,18,34,"And in charon af"
40,18,35,"Thus also Avi sh'baShomayim will do to you, unless you grant selicha"
40,19,1,"And it came to pass when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach finished these words, he departed from the Galil and came into the regions of Yehudah east of the Yarden River."
40,19,2,"And a great multitude followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach administered refu'ah to them there."
40,19,3,"And the Perushim approached him, and to test him, they asked Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Is it mutar"
40,19,4,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply, Have you not read that the Boreh"
40,19,5,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Because of this, YA'AZAV ISH ES AVIV V'ES IMMO V'DAVAK B'ISHTO V'HAYU L'VASAR ECHAD (a man will leave his father and his mother and will be joined to his isha"
40,19,6,"So they are no longer shnayim"
40,19,7,"They say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Why then did Moshe Rabbenu give the mitzva to give the get, the sefer keritut"
40,19,8,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Moshe, because of your hardness of heart, permitted you to give the get to your wives; from bereshis"
40,19,9,"But I [Moshiach] say to you that whoever, the case of zenut"
40,19,10,"Moshiach's talmidim say to him, If thus is the case of the man with the wife, it is not advantageous to marry."
40,19,11,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Not everyone is able to accept this divrei torah, but rather those to whom it has been given."
40,19,12,"For there are sarisim"
40,19,13,"Then yeladim were brought to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach that he might place his hands on them and offer tefillos. However, Moshiach's talmidim rebuked them."
40,19,14,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Permit the yeladim to come to me, and forbid them not, *  for of such is the Malchut HaShomayim.  YELADIM RECEIVE THE BIRKAT REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH"
40,19,15,"And having placed his hands on the yeladim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach departed from there. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND ONE OF THE BAALE-BATTIM OF YISROEL, WHO BECAUSE OF HIS LACK OF PERCEPTION OF TRUE RICHES, PASSES BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE MOSHIACH'S S'MICHAH TO THE MINISTRY"
40,19,16,"And--hinei--one, having approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, said, Rebbe, what mitzva, what good may I do that I may have Chayyei Olam?"
40,19,17,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Why do you ask me about the good?  There is only One who is good.  But if you wish to enter into Chayyim"
40,19,18,"He says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach,  Which mitzva?  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, LO TIRTZACH, LO TINAF, LO TIGNOV, LO TA'ANEH V'REI'ACHAH AD SHAKER, KABEID ES A'VICHA V'ES IMMECHAH, V'AHAVTAH L'RE'ACHA KAMOCHA (You shall not murder, commit adultery, steal, bear false witness;"
40,19,19,"honor your father and your mother, and You shall love your neighbor as yourself, SHEMOT 20:13"
40,19,20,"The bochur"
40,19,21,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, If you wish to be tamim"
40,19,22,"But having heard the divrei Moshiach, the young man went away with agmat nefesh"
40,19,23,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to his talmidim, Omein, I say to you that a rich person with difficulty will enter into the Malchut HaShomayim."
40,19,24,"And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to  go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the Malchut HaShomayim."
40,19,25,"And when Moshiach's talmidim heard this, they were exceedingly astounded, saying, Who then is able to receive the Yeshuat Eloheinu"
40,19,26,"And having looked upon them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, With bnei Adam it is impossible; but with Hashem all things are possible."
40,19,27,"Then Kefa said in reply to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Hinei! We have left everything and followed you [as Moshiach]!  Where does that leave us?"
40,19,28,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Omein, I say to you, that you, the ones having followed me, when the Bri'ah"
40,19,29,"And anyone who left bais or achim or achayot or Av or Em or banim or sadot"
40,19,30,"And many who are Rishonim"
40,20,1,"The Malchut HaShomayim is like a man, the Ba'al Bayit, who went out early in the boker"
40,20,2,"And having agreed with the po'alim to salary them a denarius for their day's pay, the Ba'al Bayit sent them into his kerem."
40,20,3,"And having gone out around the third hour, the Ba'al Bayit saw others loitering in the marketplace,"
40,20,4,"and he said to those, `You go also into the kerem. And whatever is right, this is what your pay will be.'"
40,20,5,"And they left.  And again, having gone out around the sixth and the ninth hour, the Ba'al Bayit did the same thing."
40,20,6,"And around the eleventh hour, having gone out, the Ba'al Bayit found others standing around, and he says to them,  `Why have you been standing here all the day not working?'"
40,20,7,"The idle workers say to the Ba'al Bayit, `Because no one hired us.` The Ba'al Bayit says to them, `You go also into the kerem.'"
40,20,8,"And when erev had come, another man, the owner of the kerem, says to his foreman, `Call the po'alim and give to them the wage, beginning with the acharonim and going to the rishonim.'"
40,20,9,"And the ones that came around the eleventh hour each received a denarius."
40,20,10,"And when the rishonim came, they were under the impression that they would receive a larger sum; instead, they themselves each received a denarius."
40,20,11,"And when they received the denarius, they were complaining against the Ba'al Bayit,"
40,20,12,"saying `These acharonim worked one hour, and you made them equal to us, the ones having endured the burden and the heat of the whole day.'"
40,20,13,"But the Ba'al Bayit said in reply to one of them, `Chaver, I am not cheating you.  Did you not agree that I would pay you the usual day's wage, a denarius?"
40,20,14,"Take what belongs to you, your denarius, and go.  But it is my ratson, my good pleasure, to give to this one who is last also what I gave to you."
40,20,15,"Or is it not allowable for me to do what I wish with the things that are mine? Or do you look with a jealous 'ayin ra'ah upon my goodness?"
40,20,16,"Thus the Rishonim will be Acharonim, and the Acharonim will be Rishonim.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND HIS THIRD NEVU'AH CONCERNING HIS MAVET AND TECHIYAS HAMESIM"
40,20,17,"And going up to Yerushalayim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took the Shneym Asar Talmidim aside privately, and, on the way, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them,"
40,20,18,"Hinei!  We are going up to Yerushalayim, and the Ben HaAdam"
40,20,19,"And they will hand Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach over to the Goyim in order to mock and to whip and to hang him up pierced al Aitz"
40,20,20,"Then the Em of Zavdai's banim, along with the sons, approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and, prostrating herself before him, she made a bakosha"
40,20,21,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to her, What do you wish? She says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Say that these, my two banim, may sit, one on your right, the other on your left, in your"
40,20,22,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply, You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the Kos which I am about to drink?  They say, We are able."
40,20,23,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Indeed, you will drink my Kos, but to sit on the right and on the left of me, this is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my"
40,20,24,"And having heard this, the Asarah"
40,20,25,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having summoned them, said, You know that those who have the rule over the Goyim domineer them like tyrants."
40,20,26,"But it will not be thus among you. For whoever wishes to be gadol among you will become your mesharet"
40,20,27,"And whoever wishes among you to be rishon"
40,20,28,"Just as the Ben HaAdam"
40,20,29,"And, as they were going out from Yericho, a great multitude followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
40,20,30,"And--hinei!--two ivrim"
40,20,31,"However, the crowd rebuked the two ivrim, that they be silent, but they shouted even more, saying Chaneinu, Adoneinu Ben Dovid!"
40,20,32,"And having stopped, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach called to them and said, What do you wish that I should do for you?"
40,20,33,"They say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoneinu, that our eyes may be opened!"
40,20,34,"And having been filled with rachmei shomayim"
40,21,1,"When they came near to Yerushalayim and arrived at Beit-Pagey on the Mount of Olives, then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sent two talmidim,"
40,21,2,"saying to them, Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey having been tied and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me."
40,21,3,"And if anyone should say to you anything, you say, `The Adon has need of them.' And he will send them immediately."
40,21,4,"And this took place in order that might be fulfilled the thing spoken by the Navi"
40,21,5,"IMRU L'BAT TZIYON!"
40,21,6,"And having accomplished just what Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had commanded them,"
40,21,7,"they brought the donkey and the colt and they put their garments upon them, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sat upon them."
40,21,8,"And the very large multitudes spread out their garments on the road, and others were cutting lulavim from the trees, and were spreading them out on the road."
40,21,9,"And the multitudes going before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and the multitudes following after Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach were crying out, saying, HOSHAN NAH"
40,21,10,"And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had entered into Yerushalayim, the whole city was stirred, saying, Who is this?"
40,21,11,"And the multitudes were saying, This is Yehoshua HaNavi!  From Natzeret in the Galil.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH CLEANSES THE BEIS HAMIKDASH"
40,21,12,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach arrived at the Beis Hamikdash and expelled the ones selling and buying in the Beis Hamikdash.  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach turned over the tishen"
40,21,13,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, It has been written, BEITI BEIT TEFILLAH YIKAREI"
40,21,14,"And iverim"
40,21,15,"And the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim, having seen the niflaot which Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach accomplished and the yeladim shouting in the Beis Hamikdash, Hosha nah to the Ben Dovid, were indignant."
40,21,16,"And they said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Do you hear what these are saying?  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Ken.  Have you never read, MIPI OLELIM V'YONKIM YISSADETAH OZ"
40,21,17,"And having left them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went out of the city to Beit-Anyah"
40,21,18,"Now going up early into the city, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was hungry."
40,21,19,"And observing the aitz te'enah"
40,21,20,"And observing this, the talmidim were astounded, saying, How did the aitz te'enah instantly wither?"
40,21,21,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply, Omein, I say to you, if you have emunah and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the aitz te'enah, but also if you say to this mountain, `Be lifted up and be thrown into the sea,' it will happen."
40,21,22,"And, when you daven, all things whatever you may with emunah make techinah"
40,21,23,"And after Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had gone into the Beis Hamikdash, while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was bringing forth his torah, the Rashei Hakohanim and the Zekenim of the people approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, By what samchut"
40,21,24,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply to them, I also will ask you a question, which, if you will tell me, I also will tell you by what samchut I do these things..."
40,21,25,"the tevilah in the mikveh mayim that Yochanan administered...it was from where, from Shomayim or from bnei Adam"
40,21,26,"But if we say, `From bnei Adam,` we fear the multitude, for everyone considers Yochanan a Navi."
40,21,27,"And in reply to him, they said, We do not know.  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Neither will I tell you by what samchut I do these things. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH GIVES A MASHAL THAT TEACHES TRUE TESHUVA"
40,21,28,"What do you think?  A man had two banim"
40,21,29,"But the first son said in reply, `I will not.`  But later, having changed his mind, he went."
40,21,30,"And having approached the other son, the man spoke similarly. But the second son, in reply, said, `I will go, Adoni.`  Yet he did not go."
40,21,31,"Which of the two did the ratson haAv"
40,21,32,"For Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva came to you in the Derech Tzidkat Hashem"
40,21,33,"Listen to another mashal.  There was a man, a Ba'al Bayit, who planted a kerem"
40,21,34,"And when the time of the Katsir"
40,21,35,"And the koremim, having seized his servants, this one they beat, another they killed, and another they stoned."
40,21,36,"And the Ba'al Bayit sent other servants, more than the rishonim"
40,21,37,"Lemaskana"
40,21,38,"And when the koremim saw the Ben, they said among themselves, This is the Bechor"
40,21,39,"And having seized the Ben, they threw the Ben out of the kerem and they killed him."
40,21,40,"Therefore, when the Ba'al HaKerem"
40,21,41,"They say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Those resha'im"
40,21,42,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Have you never heard in the Kitvei Hakodesh"
40,21,43,"For this reason, I say to you, the Malchut Hashem will be taken from you and it will be given to a people that produces its p'ri."
40,21,44,"[And the one having fallen on this stone will be crushed; and on whom ever it falls it will crush him.]"
40,21,45,"And having heard Moshiach's mashal, the Rashei Hakohanim and the Perushim understood that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke about them."
40,21,46,"And seeking to arrest him, they were afraid of the multitudes, vi-bahlt"
40,22,1,"And, in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach again spoke in meshalim"
40,22,2,"The Malchut HaShomayim is like a man, a Melech"
40,22,3,"And the Melech sent out his servants to summon the Bnei haChuppah"
40,22,4,"Again, the Melech sent out other servants, saying, `Tell the Bnei HaChuppah, the wedding invitees, Hinei! My Seudah I have prepared, my oxen and fatten calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready: Come to the chassuna!`"
40,22,5,"But the Bnei HaChuppah, the chassuna invitees, having treated it all as a mere trifle, departed, one to his farmer's field, one to his business;"
40,22,6,"meanwhile, the others seized the Mesharetim HaMelech"
40,22,7,"So the Melech was angry and, having sent his armies, the King destroyed those ratzchaniyot"
40,22,8,"Then the King says to his ministers, `The chassuna is ready, but the invited ones were not worthy."
40,22,9,"Therefore, go to the intercessions of the streets, and, whoever you find, invite as muzmanim"
40,22,10,"And having gone out to the highways, those ministers congregated everyone they found, rah and tov"
40,22,11,"And the Melech, having entered to see the ones sitting bimesibba"
40,22,12,"And the Melech says to him, `Chaver, how did you get in here, not having attire proper for the chassuna?' But the man had nothing to say.  *"
40,22,13,"Then the King said to the servants, `Bind him feet and hands and expell him into the outer choshech, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND THE YECHIDE SEGULAH"
40,22,14,"For the invited ones are many, but the nivcharim"
40,22,15,"Then, having departed, the Perushim took counsel together so that they might entrap Yehoshua in his own words."
40,22,16,"And they are sending to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach their talmidim with the Herodians, saying, Rabbi, we know that you are an ehrliche Yid"
40,22,17,"Therefore, tell us what to you seems right:  is it mutar"
40,22,18,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having known their rah"
40,22,19,"Show me the coin of the Poll tax.  And they brought to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach a denarius."
40,22,20,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Whose image is this and whose title?"
40,22,21,"They say to him Caesar's. Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Give, therefore, unto Caesar the things of Caesar, and the things of Hashem, unto Hashem."
40,22,22,"And having heard this, they were amazed and, having left Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, they went away.  THE SHEILAH"
40,22,23,"On that day some Tzedukim"
40,22,24,"saying, Rabbi, Moshe Rabbenu  said that if someone dies, not having banim, his brother shall marry his isha"
40,22,25,"Now there were among us shiva achim"
40,22,26,"Likewise, also the second brother and the third, up to the seventh."
40,22,27,"And last of all, the isha died."
40,22,28,"In the Techiyas HaMesim, therefore, she will be the woman of which of the seven? For all had her."
40,22,29,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply to them, You are in error, not having known the Kitvei HaKodesh or the gevurat Hashem."
40,22,30,"For in the Techiyas HaMesim they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the malachim in Shomayim."
40,22,31,"But concerning the Techiyas HaMesim, have you not read the thing spoken to you by Hashem, saying,"
40,22,32,"ANOCHI ELOHEI AVRAHAM ELOHEI YITZCHAK VEELOHEI YA'AKOV"
40,22,33,"And having heard this, the multitudes were amazed at oshiach's torah"
40,22,34,"But the Perushim, having heard that he silenced the Tzedukim, assembled together,"
40,22,35,"and one of them, a Ba'al Torah"
40,22,36,"Rabbi, which mitzva is gedolah"
40,22,37,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave this teshuva"
40,22,38,"This is the gedolah and rishonah mitzva."
40,22,39,"And the second mitzva is like it: V'AHAVTAH L'REI'ACHA KAMOCHA"
40,22,40,"On these two mitzvot hang the entire Torah and the Nevi'im.  MOSHIACH MAKES A DIYUK"
40,22,41,"And, the Perushim, having been assembled, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach confronted with this sh'eilah"
40,22,42,"saying, What do you think concerning the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach?  Whose Ben is he?  The Perushim gave this teshuva"
40,22,43,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, How then can Dovid, in the Ruach HaKodesh, call Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach `Adon`?... saying"
40,22,44,"NE'UM HASHEM LAADONI, SHEV LIMINI AD ASHIT OYVECHA HADOM LERAGLECHA"
40,22,45,"Therefore, if Dovid calls him `Adon,` how is Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach [merely] Ben Dovid?"
40,22,46,"And no one was able to give a teshuva"
40,23,1,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke to the multitudes and to his talmidim,"
40,23,2,"saying, Upon the Kisse Moshe"
40,23,3,"Therefore, everything whatever they may tell you, be frum and be shomer, but according to their ma'asim"
40,23,4,"And they tie up heavy [extra-Biblical, Mt.4:4; 15:3,6-9; 22:29] loads, hard to bear, and they place them upon the shoulders of men, but they, with so much as a finger, are not willing to lift the oppressive burdens.  DO NOT SEEK AFTER CHASHIVUS OR A CHASHUVE POSITION IN THE KEHILLAH"
40,23,5,"And all their ma'asim hamitzvot"
40,23,6,"and they love the places of honor at the seudot"
40,23,7,"and the `Shalom' greetings in the market places, and to be called by Bnei Adam, `Rebbe.'"
40,23,8,"But you are not to have pretentious titles like `Rebbe,' for One is your Rebbe [Moshiach], and all of you are achim."
40,23,9,"And do not refer to anyone in Olam Hazeh as your `Abba,' for One is your Av sh'baShomayim."
40,23,10,"Neither be called `Moreh Torah,' for One is your Moreh --the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
40,23,11,"And the greatest among you will be your mesharet"
40,23,12,"But whoever will lift up himself will be humbled, and whoever will humble himself will be lifted up."
40,23,13,"But oy to you, Sofrim and Perushim, tzevu'im"
40,23,14,"missing fehlt/missing"
40,23,15,"Oy to you, Sofrim and Perushim, tzevu'im, for you travel over the sea and the dry land for the giyyur"
40,23,16,"Oy to you, morei derech ivrim"
40,23,17,"Iverim!"
40,23,18,"`And whoever swears by the Mizbe'ach"
40,23,19,"Ivrim, blind ones, for which is greater, the korban or the Mizbe'ach which gives the korban its kedusha"
40,23,20,"Therefore, the one having sworn by the Mizbe'ach swears by it and everything upon it."
40,23,21,"And the one having sworn by the Beis Hamikdash swears by it and by everything indwelling it."
40,23,22,"And the one having sworn by Shomayim swears by the Kisei Hashem and by the One sitting upon it. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH SPEAKS ABOUT TERUMOS"
40,23,23,"Oy to you, Sofrim and Perushim, tzevu'im, for you give ma'aser"
40,23,24,"Morei derech ivrim"
40,23,25,"Oy to you, Sofrim and Perushim, tzevu'im,  you cleanse the outside of the kos"
40,23,26,"Blind Parush, first cleanse the inside of the kos, that perhaps also the outside may become clean."
40,23,27,"Oy to you, Sofrim and Perushim, tzevu'im, for you are like kevarim"
40,23,28,"Thus on the outside you indeed appear tzodek"
40,23,29,"Oy to you, Sofrim and Perushim, tzevu'im, for you build kevarim of the Nevi'im and decorate matsevot"
40,23,30,"and you say, `If we were in the yamim"
40,23,31,"Therefore, you give edut"
40,23,32,"And you fill up the measure of your Avot."
40,23,33,"Snakes, you yeladim of nachashim, how can you escape the Yom HaDin of Gehinnom?"
40,23,34,"For this reason--hinei!--I send to you Nevi'im and Chachamim and Sofrim, some of whom you will kill and some you will pierce al aitz"
40,23,35,"so that upon you may come all the dahm naki"
40,23,36,"Omein, I say to you, that all these things will come upon this generation. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH GIVES THE NEVU'AH"
40,23,37,"Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, the ones that kill the Nevi'im and stone those having been sent to you!  How often have I wanted to gather your yeladim, as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, but you were not willing!"
40,23,38,"Hinei! Look!  KI LECHARBAHYIH' YEH HABEIT HAZEH (`for this House will become a ruin`"
40,23,39,"For I say to you, by no means will you see me"
40,24,1,"And having exited from the Beis Hamikdash, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach departed, and his talmidim approached to show him the buildings of the Beis Hamikdash."
40,24,2,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply to them, Do you not see all these things? Omein, I say to you, by no means will be left here one stone upon another, for all will be demolished."
40,24,3,"And while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was sitting upon the Mount of Olives, his talmidim approached him privately, saying, Tell us when these things will be and what about the ot"
40,24,4,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in reply to them, See to it that someone does not deceive you."
40,24,5,"For many  will come in my Name, saying `I am  the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.`   And they will deceive many."
40,24,6,"But you are about to hear about milchamot"
40,24,7,"For there will be an intifada of ethnic group against ethnic group, and malchut against malchut.  And there will be famines and earthquakes in place after place."
40,24,8,"But all these things are but the beginning of the Chevlei [Moshiach]."
40,24,9,"Then they will hand you over to tzoros and they will kill you and you will be hated by all the ethnic groups on account of the Name of me"
40,24,10,"And then many will be led into chet"
40,24,11,"And many nevi'ei sheker"
40,24,12,"And because of the increased hefkerut"
40,24,13,"But the one having endured to HaKets"
40,24,14,"And this Besuras HaGeulah of the Malchut will be announced in kol haOlam"
40,24,15,"Therefore, when you see the Shikuts HaMeshomem"
40,24,16,"Then the ones in Yehudah, let them flee to the mountains."
40,24,17,"The one upon the roof, let him not come down to carry away the things from his bais"
40,24,18,"And the one in the field, let him not turn back to get his kaftan."
40,24,19,"But oy to the ones who are `with child` and the ones with nursing infants in those days."
40,24,20,"But offer tefillos that your escape may not be in winter or on Shabbos."
40,24,21,"For then will be Tzarah Gedolah"
40,24,22,"And if those days were not cut short, kol basar"
40,24,23,"Then, if someone says to you, `Hinei, here is the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach!,` or, `Hinei! Here!` do not have emunah"
40,24,24,"For meshichei sheker"
40,24,25,"Hinei!  I have told  you beforehand!"
40,24,26,"If, therefore, they say to you, `Hinei! He"
40,24,27,"For as lightning goes out from the mizrach"
40,24,28,"Wherever the place of the Geviya"
40,24,29,"Immediately after the Tzarah"
40,24,30,"And then will appear the Ot Ben Adam"
40,24,31,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach will send his malachim with a loud blast of the Shofar, and the malachim will gather together Moshiach's Bechirim from the four winds, from one end of Shomayim to the other.  MOSHIACH'S HINT FOR MECHASHVEI KITSIN"
40,24,32,"And from the aitz te'enah"
40,24,33,"thus also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the very doors."
40,24,34,"Omein, I say to you, that this dor"
40,24,35,"Shomayim v'ha'Aretz"
40,24,36,"But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, neither the malachim haShomayim nor HaBen, but only HaAv"
40,24,37,"For as in the days of Noach, thus will be the Bias HaMoshiach, the Coming of the Ben HaAdam."
40,24,38,"For as they were in those days before HaMabbul"
40,24,39,"And they did not know until HaMabbul came and took away everything--thus also will be the Bias HaMoshiach, the Coming of the Ben HaAdam."
40,24,40,"Then two men will be in the field, one is snatched away, and one is left behind"
40,24,41,"Two women are grinding in the mill house, one is snatched away, one is left behind."
40,24,42,"So be shomer, be on your guard, because you do not know on which day will be the Bias of Adoneichem"
40,24,43,"But understand this: if the Ba'al Bayit had known in which watch the Ganav is coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have allowed his bais to be dug through."
40,24,44,"For this reason also you be shomer,  for in the hour when you do not think, then will be the Bias HaMoshiach"
40,24,45,"Who then is the faithful and wise eved"
40,24,46,"Ashrey"
40,24,47,"Omein, I say to you, the Adon will ordain him to oversee all his possessions."
40,24,48,"But if that wicked slave says in his heart, `Adoni"
40,24,49,"and he begins to beat his fellow avadim"
40,24,50,"the Adon of that slave will come on a day which he does not expect, and at an hour which he does not know."
40,24,51,"And the Adon will cut in two that slave, and the slaves' portion he will put with the tzevu'im"
40,25,1,"Then the Malchut HaShomayim will be compared to eser almot"
40,25,2,"Now five of them were foolish and five were wise."
40,25,3,"When the foolish took their menorahs, they neglected to take shemen"
40,25,4,"But the wise took shemen in containers with their menorahs."
40,25,5,"Now the Chosson, being delayed, here's what happened:  all the almot became drowsy and were sleeping."
40,25,6,"And at chatsot halailah"
40,25,7,"Then all the eser almot awakened and they trimmed their menorahs."
40,25,8,"But the foolish said to the wise, `Give us from your shemen"
40,25,9,"But the wise answered, saying, `Perhaps there might not be enough for us and for you.  Instead, you go to the ones selling and buy for yourselves.`"
40,25,10,"And as they were going away to buy, the Bias of the Chosson"
40,25,11,"And later, here comes also the other almot, saying, `Adoneinu, Adoneinu, open the door for us.`"
40,25,12,"But he, in reply, said, `Omein, I say to you, I do not know you.`"
40,25,13,"Be shomer, be on the alert, therefore, for you do not know the Yom or the Sha'ah"
40,25,14,"For it is as a man going on a journey, who called to his own avadim"
40,25,15,"And to this one, he gave five talents, and to this one, two, and to this one, one, each according to his own ability. Then the man went on his journey.  Immediately"
40,25,16,"after the man had gone, the one having received the five talents, went to work with them, and gained five others."
40,25,17,"Likewise, the one having received the two talents--this one gained two others."
40,25,18,"But the one, having received one, went out and dug a hole in the ground and buried the gelt"
40,25,19,"And after much time, here comes the Adon of those servants.  And he conducts a settling of accounts with them."
40,25,20,"Then the one who had received five talents came forward, bringing five more talents, saying, `Adoni, five talents you gave me.  Hinei! Five more talents I gained.`"
40,25,21,"And his Adon said to him, `Shkoyach"
40,25,22,"And having come forward, the one having received two talents, said, `You bestowed upon me two talents. Hinei! Two more talents I gained.`"
40,25,23,"His Adon said to him, `Shkoyach"
40,25,24,"And also the one who had received one talent stepped forward.   He said, `Adoni, I knew that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering from that which you did not scatter seed."
40,25,25,"And having been afraid and having gone away, I hid your talent by burying it in the ground.  Here, see, you have that which belongs to you.`"
40,25,26,"And, in reply, his Adon said to him, `You farbissener"
40,25,27,"Then why was it not necessary for you to deposit my gelt with the bankers, and having returned, I would have received back that which was mine with interest?"
40,25,28,"Take, therefore, from him the talent and give it to the one having the ten talents."
40,25,29,"For to everyone having, it will be given and he will have abundance, but from the one not having, even what he has will be taken from him."
40,25,30,"And as for the useless slave, throw him into the outer choshech. There will be weeping and grinding of teeth.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND THE YOM HADIN OF THE NATIONS"
40,25,31,"And when the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach"
40,25,32,"And there will be assembled all the Goyim, and He will separate them from each other as the Ro'eh"
40,25,33,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach will put the Kevasim on the right of him, but the Izzim on his left."
40,25,34,"Then HaMelech HaMoshiach will say to the ones on his right, `Come! Baruchei Avi"
40,25,35,"For I hungered and you gave me something to eat.  I thirsted and you gave drink to me. I was a sojourner, and you extended hachnosat orchim"
40,25,36,"I was naked and you gave me malbish arumim"
40,25,37,"Then the tzaddikim will answer Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, `Adoneinu, when did we see you hungering and we fed you, or thirsting and we gave you drink?"
40,25,38,"And when did we see you a sojourner and we extended hachnosat orchim"
40,25,39,"And when did we see you ill or in the beit hasohar and we came to you?`"
40,25,40,"And, in reply, Rebbe HaMelech HaMoshiach will say to them, `Omein, I say to you, in as much as you did it to one of the least of these achim of mine, you did it to me.`"
40,25,41,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach will say also to the ones on his left, `Depart from me, the ones having been cursed, into the Aish Olam having been prepared for Hasatan and his malachim."
40,25,42,"For I hungered and you did not give me something to eat, I thirsted and you did not give drink to me."
40,25,43,"I was a sojourner and you did not extend hachnosat orchim to me, I was naked and you did not clothe me, ill and in the beit hasohar and you did not visit me."
40,25,44,"Then also they will answer, saying, `Adoneinu, when did we see you hungering or thirsting or a sojourner or naked or sick or in the beit hasohar and we did not minister to you?"
40,25,45,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach will answer them, saying, `Omein, I say to you, in  as much as you did not do it for one of these least ones, neither for me did you do it."
40,25,46,"And these will go away into Onesh Olam"
40,26,1,"And it came about when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach completed all these divrei torah, he said to his talmidim,"
40,26,2,"You know, that after two days, there is Pesach, and the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach"
40,26,3,"Then the Rashei Hakohanim and the Ziknei haAm"
40,26,4,"And they planned to arrest Yeshoshua by a trap and kill him."
40,26,5,"But they were saying, Not during the Chag"
40,26,6,"And, while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was in Beit-Anyah in the bais of Shimon the leper,"
40,26,7,"an isha"
40,26,8,"And having seen this, Moshiach's talmidim were angry, saying, For what is this waste?"
40,26,9,"For it would have been possible to sell this for a generous sum and give to the aniyim"
40,26,10,"Aware of this, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Why are you bringing about difficulty for the isha for the ma'aseh tov"
40,26,11,"For the aniyim you have with you always, but you do not always have me [Moshiach]."
40,26,12,"For this isha"
40,26,13,"Omein, I say to you, wherever this Besuras HaGeulah is preached b'chol HaOlam"
40,26,14,"Then, one of the Shneym Asar"
40,26,15,"and said, `What are you willing to give me? And I will hand him over to you.'  And they weighed out for him sheloshim shiklei kesef"
40,26,16,"And from then on he was seeking an opportunity that he might hand Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach over."
40,26,17,"But on the first day of Chag HaMatzot, Moshiach's talmidim approached him, saying, Where do you wish we should prepare for you your Seder?"
40,26,18,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Go into the city to such-and-such person and say to him, `Our Rebbe says, my time is at hand.  With you I am observing Pesach with my talmidim.`"
40,26,19,"And the talmidim did as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach commanded them, and they prepared the Seder.  MOSHIACH'S FINAL HAMOTZI AND BERAKHAH OVER THE CUP OF BERACHA"
40,26,20,"When erev came, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was sitting bimesibba"
40,26,21,"And as they were eating with their Rebbe, he said, Omein, I say to you that one of you will be my betrayer.  THE TIME OF CHESHBON HANEFESH OF THE SHLUCHIM AND THE BEDIKAS CHOMETZ OF DENIAL AND BETRAYAL"
40,26,22,"And much distressed, each one began to say to him, Surely I am not the one, Adoni?"
40,26,23,"But, in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, The one having dipped the hand into the bowl [SHEMOT 12:8] with me, this one is my betrayer."
40,26,24,"Indeed the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach"
40,26,25,"And, in reply, Yehudah the betrayer of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, said, Surely I am not the one, Rebbi?  Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to Yehudah, You have said it."
40,26,26,"And at the Seudah, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having taken matzah, having made the ha-Motzi, he offered the betzi'at halechem"
40,26,27,"And having taken the Kiddush Cup"
40,26,28,"For this is my [Moshiach's] Dahm HaBrit HaChadasha, which is being shed LARABBIM"
40,26,29,"And I say to you, I will by no means drink from now on of this p'ri hagefen"
40,26,30,"And having sung the Hallel, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
40,26,31,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, All of you will be offended at me [Moshiach] during this night, for it has been written, HACH ES HARO'EH UTEFUTSEN HATSON"
40,26,32,"But after I undergo Techiyas HaMesim I will go ahead of you to the Galil. [Mt.28:7]"
40,26,33,"And, in reply, Kefa said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, If everyone will be offended at you, I never will be offended."
40,26,34,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Omein, I say to you that balailah hazeh"
40,26,35,"Kefa says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Even if it is necessary for me to die with you, by no means will I deny you. Likewise all the talmidim spoke also.   THE FINAL TEMPTATION OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH; THE ADAM HECHADASH IN THE GAN HANISYONOS"
40,26,36,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes with them to a place being called Gat-Sh'manim, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to the talmidim, Sit here until I go over there and daven."
40,26,37,"And having taken Kefa and the two sons of Zavdai, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to be sorrowful and distressed with agmat nefesh"
40,26,38,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, My nefesh is deadly grieved, even to the point of mavet"
40,26,39,"And having gone forward a short distance, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach fell upon his face, davening and saying, Avi, if it is possible, let this Kos * pass from me. But not as I will but as you will"
40,26,40,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes to the talmidim and finds them sleeping, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to Kefa, So were you not strong enough to be awake for one hour with me?"
40,26,41,"Stay awake and offer tefillos, lest you enter lidey nisayon"
40,26,42,"Again, for a second time, having left, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach davened, saying, Avi, if it is not possible for this to pass by except I drink it, let ye'aseh  r'tzonechah. [Mt.6:10]"
40,26,43,"And having come again, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach found the talmidim sleeping, for their eyes were too heavy to stay open."
40,26,44,"And having left them again and having gone away, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was davening for the shlishit"
40,26,45,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes to the talmidim and says to them, Sleep on now and take your rest.  Hinei!  The hour is at hand, and the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach"
40,26,46,"Arise, and let us go. Hinei!  My betrayer has drawn near."
40,26,47,"And while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was still speaking-- hinei!-- Yehudah, one of the Shneym Asar, came and with him came a great multitude with swords and clubs from the Rashei Hakohanim"
40,26,48,"Now the betrayer had given them a signal, saying, Whomever I may give the neshikah"
40,26,49,"And immediately, he approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and said, Shalom, Rebbe.  And he gave him the neshikah."
40,26,50,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Chaver, do what you came for. Then, having approached, they laid hands on Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and arrested him."
40,26,51,"And--hinei!--one of the ones with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach stretched out his hand, drew his cherev"
40,26,52,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, Return your sword into its place; for all who take the sword will die by the sword."
40,26,53,"Or do you think that I am not able to call upon Avi, and He will provide me now more than Shneym Asar legions of malachim?"
40,26,54,"But how then may the Kitvei Hakodesh be fulfilled that say it must happen thus?"
40,26,55,"At that moment, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to the multitudes, Do you have the chutzpah"
40,26,56,"But this all happened that the Kitvei Hakodesh of the Nevi'im might be fulfilled.  Then the talmidim deserted Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and fled.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEFORE THE SANHEDRIN, THE BEGINNING OF HIS TZA'AR"
40,26,57,"But the ones having arrested Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach led him away to Caiapha the Kohen Gadol, where the Sofrim and the Zekenim"
40,26,58,"And Kefa was following Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach from far away. He followed him as far as the courtyard of the Kohen Gadol and, having gone inside it, Kefa was sitting down with the servants to see the outcome."
40,26,59,"And the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sanhedrin all were seeking edut sheker"
40,26,60,"And they found none, though many with edut sheker came forward. At last, two came forward"
40,26,61,"and said, This one said, `I am able to bring about a churban"
40,26,62,"And having got up, the Kohen Gadol said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Do you answer nothing? For what do these men give edut"
40,26,63,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was silent.  And the Kohen Gadol said to him, I adjure you by Hashem, Elohim Chayyim, to tell us if you are the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Ben HaElohim."
40,26,64,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, You said it.  But I say to you, `From now on you will see the Ben HaAdam"
40,26,65,"Then the Kohen Gadol made the keriah"
40,26,66,"What does it seem to you?  And, in reply, they said, He is deserving of the death penalty."
40,26,67,"Then they spat into his face and they struck him and they slapped him,"
40,26,68,"saying, Give us nevu'ah, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  Who is the one who hit you? KEFA MAKES HAKHCHASHAH"
40,26,69,"Now Kefa was sitting outside in the courtyard. And one maid approached Kefa, saying, And you were with Yehoshua of the Galil!"
40,26,70,"But Kefa denied it before everyone, saying, I do not know what you are saying."
40,26,71,"And having gone out to the gate, another saw Kefa and says to the bystanders, There!  This one was with Yehoshua of Natzeret!"
40,26,72,"And again Kefa denied it with a shevu'ah"
40,26,73,"And after a little while the bystanders came and said to Kefa, Truly also you are one of them, for even your accent gives you away!"
40,26,74,"Then Kefa began to curse and swear, I do not know the man! And immediately a tarnegol"
40,26,75,"And Kefa remembered the word which Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had said: Before a tarnegol"
40,27,1,"Now when boker had come, all the Rashei Hakohenim and the Ziknei haAm took counsel together against Yehoshua to put him to death.  HASHEM'S AKEDAH OF THE REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH, WHO IS HIMSELF THE YITZCHAK OF YISROEL'S REDEMPTION; MATTITYAHU WAS MECHAVEN"
40,27,2,"And having performed the akedah"
40,27,3,"Then when Yehudah, who had betrayed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saw that Yehoshua had been condemned, he felt remorse and returned the sheloshim shiklei kesef"
40,27,4,"saying Chatati"
40,27,5,"And Yehudah threw the shiklei kesef"
40,27,6,"And the Rashei Hakohanim took the shiklei kesef and said, It is asur"
40,27,7,"And they took counsel together and they bought the potter's field as a beit kevarot"
40,27,8,"For this reason that field has been called the `Sadeh HaDahm"
40,27,9,"Then that which was spoken through Yirmeyah HaNavi was fulfilled, saying, And they took the SHELOSHIM KASEF"
40,27,10,"And they gave them for the potter's field as Hashem directed"
40,27,11,"Now Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach stood before the Governor, and the Governor questioned Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, Are you the Melech HaYehudim?  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, It is as you say."
40,27,12,"And while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was being accused by the Rashei Hakohanim and the Zekenim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered nothing."
40,27,13,"Then Pilate said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Do you not hear how many things they give edut against you?"
40,27,14,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not answer him with even one word, so that the Governor was quite amazed. THOUGH IT IS PESACH AND NOT YOM KIPPUR, REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH FULFILLS A YOM KIPPUR MOTIF IN THE QUESTION OF KAPPARAH IN TWO SONS OF THE FATHER, ONE FOR HASHEM, ONE FOR AZAZEL (VAYIKRA 16:6-9]; MOSHIACH MA SHE-EIN KEIN BAR-ABBA"
40,27,15,"Now at the Chag"
40,27,16,"And they were holding at the time a notorious prisoner, called [Yeshua] Bar-Abba [son of the father]."
40,27,17,"When therefore they were gathered together Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release for you, Bar-Abba or Yehoshua who is called Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach?"
40,27,18,"For Pilate knew that because of kin'ah"
40,27,19,"And while Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that Tzaddik; for last night I suffered greatly in a cholom"
40,27,20,"However, the Rashei Hakohanim and the Zekenim persuaded the multitudes to ask for Bar-Abba, but Yehoshua they should destroy."
40,27,21,"But the Governor answered, saying to them, Which of the two do you want me to release for you? and they said, Bar-Abba."
40,27,22,"In reply, Pilate says to them,  What, therefore, may I do with Yehoshua, the one called the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach? Everyone says, Let him be hanged on HaAitz"
40,27,23,"But Pilate said, Why? What ra'ah"
40,27,24,"And when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the multitude, saying, I am innocent of this man's blood; see to that yourselves."
40,27,25,"And, in reply, all the people said, His dahm be on us and on our yeladim. *"
40,27,26,"Then Pilate released Bar-Abba to them.  But after having Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach scourged, he handed him over to be hanged on HaAitz.  MOSHIACH'S KETER OF THORNS"
40,27,27,"Then the soldiers of the Governor took Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach into the praetorium and gathered the whole cohort against Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
40,27,28,"And they stripped him and put a royal scarlet robe on him, and,"
40,27,29,"after weaving a keter of thorns, they placed it on his head and put a reed in his right hand, and they fell down before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and mocked him saying, Hail, Melech HaYehudim!"
40,27,30,"And they spat on Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and took the reed and began to beat him on the head."
40,27,31,"And after they had ridiculed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, they took his robe off and put his garments on him, and led him away to hang him on HaAitz."
40,27,32,"And as they were coming out, they found a man from Cyrene named Shimon, whom they pressed into service to bear Moshiach's Aitz"
40,27,33,"And when they had come to a place called Gulgolta, which means place of a skull,"
40,27,34,"they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And, after tasting it, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was unwilling to drink.        THE HAGBA"
40,27,35,"When they had hanged Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach on HaAitz,  they divided up Moshiach's garments among themselves, casting lots;"
40,27,36,"and, sitting down, they began to keep watch over him there."
40,27,37,"They put up above his head the charge against him which read, THIS IS YEHOSHUA, MELECH HAYEHUDIM."
40,27,38,"At that time, two shodedim"
40,27,39,"And those passing by were hurling Chillul Hashem at Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, wagging their heads,"
40,27,40,"and saying, You who are going to cause the churban"
40,27,41,"Likewise, also the Rashei Hakohanim along with the Sofrim and Zekenim, were mocking him, and saying,"
40,27,42,"He saved others;  yet himself he is not able to save. He is Melech Yisroel?  Let him now come down from the Aitz, and we shall have emunah in him."
40,27,43,"He trusts in Hashem; let Hashem be his Moshi'a and deliver him now, if Hashem takes pleasure in him, for this one said, `Ben HaElohim Ani!`"
40,27,44,"And the shodedim"
40,27,45,"Now, from the sixth hour, choshech fell upon all the land until the ninth hour."
40,27,46,"And about the ninth hour, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach cried out with a kol gadol, saying Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani! *"
40,27,47,"And some of those who were standing there, when they heard, began saying, This one calls for Eliyahu."
40,27,48,"And immediately one of them ran and, taking a sponge, filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave him a drink."
40,27,49,"But the rest of them said, Wait.  We will see whether Eliyahu will come to save him."
40,27,50,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up his ruach."
40,27,51,"And--hinei!--the parochet"
40,27,52,"and the kevarim"
40,27,53,"And coming out of the kevarim after Moshiach's Techiyas HaMesim, they entered the Ir HaKodesh"
40,27,54,"Now when the centurion, and those who were with him keeping guard over Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, they became very frightened and said, Truly this was the Ben HaElohim."
40,27,55,"And many nashim were there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach from the Galil and had ministered to him."
40,27,56,"Among them was Miryam of Magdala, Miryam the Em of Ya'akov and Yosef, and the Em of Zavdai's sons.  THE MOSHIACH'S OWN CHEVRAH KADDISHA FORMS TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE KEVURAH OF THE NIFTAR"
40,27,57,"And when it was erev, there came a rich man from Ramatayim named Yosef who himself had also become a talmid of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
40,27,58,"This man went to Pilate and asked for the guf Yehoshua [TEHILLIM 16:9-10]. Then Pilate ordered it to be given over to Yosef."
40,27,59,"And Yosef took the guf Yehoshua, and wrapped it in a tachrichim,"
40,27,60,"and laid it in his own new kever, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the kever"
40,27,61,"And Miryam of Magdala, and the other Miryam, stayed there, sitting opposite the kever."
40,27,62,"Now on the next day [trans. note: i.e. Shabbos], which is the one after the Preparation,* the Rashei Hakohanim and the Perushim gathered together with Pilate"
40,27,63,"and said, Sir, we remember that when he was still alive that mat'eh"
40,27,64,"Therefore, give orders for the kever to be made secure until the Yom HaShlishi"
40,27,65,"Pilate said to them, You have a guard, go make the kever as secure as you know how."
40,27,66,"And they went and made the kever secure, and, along with the guard, they set a seal on the"

40,28,2,"And--hinei!--a great earthquake had occurred, for a malach Adonoi"
40,28,3,"And his appearance was like lightning and his garment as white as snow."
40,28,4,"And the shomrim shook for fear of him and became like dead men."
40,28,5,"And the malach, in reply, said to the nashim,  Do not be afraid, for I know that you are seeking Yehoshua, who has been hanged on HaAitz. *"
40,28,6,"He is not here. For to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach has come the Techiyas HaMesim, just as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying."
40,28,7,"And go quickly, tell his talmidim about Moshiach's Techiyas HaMesim.  And--hinei!--he is going ahead of you into the Galil.  There you will see him.  Hinei! I have told you!"
40,28,8,"And they departed quickly from the kever with fear and great simcha and ran to report everything to Moshiach's talmidim."
40,28,9,"And--hinei!--Moshiach met them, saying Shalom Alechem.  And they came up and took hold of his feet and fell prostrate before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
40,28,10,"Then he said to them, Do not be afraid; go and take word to my achim that they may go away to the Galil, and there they shall see me."
40,28,11,"Now while they were on their way--hinei!--some of the shomrim came into the city and reported to the Rashei Hakohanim all the things that had happened."
40,28,12,"And when they had assembled with the Zekenim and counseled together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,"
40,28,13,"and said, You are to say, `His talmidim came by night and stole him away while we were asleep,`"
40,28,14,"And if this should come to the Governor's ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble."
40,28,15,"And the ones who took the kesef did as they had been instructed, and this story was widely spread among the Yehudim to this day."
40,28,16,"But the Achad Asar Talmidim proceeded to the Galil, to the mountain which Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had designated."
40,28,17,"And when they saw him, they prostrated themselves before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, but some were doubtful. MOSHIACH'S PROGRAM OF KIRUV RECHOKIM"

41,1,9,"And it was during that period that Yehoshua from Natzeret of the Galil came and submitted to Yochanan's tevilah in the mikveh mayim of the Yarden."
41,1,10,"And ofen ort"
41,1,11,"And there was a bat kol out of Shomayim, ATAH BNI AHUVI ASHER B'CHA CHAFATSTI"

41,1,14,"Now after Yochanan was arrested, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came to the Galil, proclaiming the Besuras HaGeulah of Hashem,      MOSHIACH THE MAGGID OF TESHUVAH"
41,1,15,"and saying, The appointed time has been fulfilled and the Malchut Hashem has come near. Make teshuva, and have emunah in the Besuras HaGeulah.

41,1,16,"And passing along beside Lake Kinneret"

41,1,26,"And, the ruach hatameh, throwing him into convulsions, let out a shrai"
41,1,27,"And all were astounded so that they began to discuss with each other, saying, What is this?  Torah Chadasha with samchut?  He gives orders to the shedim and they obey him?"

41,1,33,"And the whole shtetl gathered together at the delet."
41,1,34,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach administered refu'ah to many cholim suffering from various machalot, and he cast out many shedim. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not permit the shedim to give utterance, for the shedim knew the raz of his identity, that he was the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH MAKES HIS FIRST ITINERARY THROUGH THE GALIL"
41,1,35,"And very early, while it was still dark, having got up, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went out and away to a desolate place, and was davening shacharis there."
41,1,36,"And Shimon and those with him searched for Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
41,1,37,"And they found him and they say to him, Everyone is seeking you [Shir HaShirim 1:4; Chaggai 2:7]."
41,1,38,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Let us go elsewhere into the neighboring shtetlach, so that also there I may preach. For it was for this [purpose] I came. [Yeshayah 61:1]"
41,1,39,"And he came preaching in their shuls"
41,1,40,"And an ish metzorah"
41,1,41,"And being filled with rachmei Shomayim [and] stretching out his hand, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach touched [the man] and says to him, I am willing. Be made tahor"
41,1,42,"And ofen ort"
41,1,43,"And having sternly warned him, ofen ort"
41,1,44,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, See [that] you say nothing to anyone, but rather go show yourself to the kohen and offer [the korban] for the tohorah of you which Moshe"
41,1,45,"But the one having gone out began to preach many things and to spread the dvar, so that no longer was Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach able to openly enter into [the] shtetl, but he was outside in desolate places. And they were coming to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach from every direction."
41,2,1,"And having entered again into K'far-Nachum after [many] yamim, it was heard that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is at home."
41,2,2,"And many were gathered together so that there was no longer any room at the delet, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was speaking the dvar Hashem to them."
41,2,3,"And they come carrying to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach a paralytic being carried along by arba'a anashim."
41,2,4,"And not being able to bring [the paralytic] to him on account of the multitude, they removed the roof where Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was, and having made an opening, they lowered the mat upon which the paralytic was lying."
41,2,5,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having seen the emunah of them, says to the paralytic, Beni, your averos are granted selicha."
41,2,6,"And there were some of the Sofrim"
41,2,7,"Why is this one speaking thus?  He is guilty of Chillul Hashem gidduf.  Who is able to grant selicha to averos except Hashem?  [Yeshayah 43:25]"
41,2,8,"And, ofen ort"
41,2,9,"Which is easier? To say to the paralytic, `Your averos are granted selicha', or to say, `Stand and pick up your mat and walk'?"
41,2,10,"But in order that you may have da'as that the Ben HaAdam"
41,2,11,"To you I say, stand, pick up your mat, and go to your bais."
41,2,12,"And the man arose, and, ofen ort"
41,2,13,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went out again beside the lake; and all the multitude was coming to him, and he was teaching them Torah."
41,2,14,"And as he was passing by, he saw Levi Ben Chalfai sitting in the tax office, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, Follow me. And, rising up, Levi"
41,2,15,"And it came to pass that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach reclined at tish in Levi's house, and many mochesim"
41,2,16,"And the Sofrim"
41,2,17,"And having heard this, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, It's not the strong ones that have need of a rofeh"
41,2,18,"And the talmidim of Yochanan and the Perushim came with tzomot.  And they come and say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Why [do] the talmidim of the Perushim and the talmidim of Yochanan come with tzomot, but your talmidim do not?"
41,2,19,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, said to them, Surely the Bnei HaChuppah of the Chosson"
41,2,20,"But yamim will come when the Chosson is taken away from them, and then they will undergo tzomot HaYom HaHu."
41,2,21,"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise, the patch will pull away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear results."
41,2,22,"And no one puts yayin chadash"
41,2,23,"And it came about [that] on Shabbos, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was passing through the grainfields, and his talmidim began to make [their] way picking the heads of grain. [Devarim 23:25]"
41,2,24,"And the Perushim said to him, Look, why are they on Shabbatot engaging in what is not mutar"
41,2,25,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Have you never read in the Tanakh what Dovid HaMelech did when he was in need and he was hungry, he and the ones with him?"
41,2,26,"How he entered into the Beis Hashem during the yamim of Avyator the Kohen Gadol and the Lechem HaPanim he ate, which to be eaten it is not mutar"
41,2,27,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Shabbos was created for the sake of man and not man for the sake of Shabbos. [Shemot 23:12; Devarim 5:14]"
41,2,28,"Therefore, HaBen HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] is Adon even of Shabbos."
41,3,1,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach entered again into the shul. And there was there a man having a withered hand."
41,3,2,"And they were watching Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach [to see] if on Shabbatot he will heal him, in order that they might accuse him."
41,3,3,"And he says to the man, the one with the withered hand, Stand up here in the center."
41,3,4,"And he says to them, Is it mutar"
41,3,5,"And having looked [at] them with ka'as and having agmat nafesh at the stubborn hardness of their levavot, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to the man. Stretch out your hand, And the man stretched it out, and his hand was restored."
41,3,6,"And ofen ort"
41,3,7,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach with his talmidim went away to the lake, and a great multitude from the Galil and also from Yehudah followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
41,3,8,"And from Yerushalayim and from Idumea and from the other side of the Yarden and from around Tzor-Tzidon area, a great multitude [followed], hearing everything that he was doing, and they came to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach."
41,3,9,"And he said to his talmidim that a sirah"
41,3,10,"For he had brought refu'ah to many, with the result that as many as had afflictions pressed in on him in order to touch him."
41,3,11,"And the ruchot hatemei'ot"
41,3,12,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sternly rebuked them, lest they should make him known."
41,3,13,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach goes up to the mountain and summons those whom he wanted, and they came to him."
41,3,14,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach appointed and gave s'michah to Shneym Asar, whom also he designated Shluchim, that they might be with him [have chavurah with him], and that he might send them out as his maggidim to preach,"
41,3,15,"and to have samchut to cast out shedim."
41,3,16,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach appointed the Shneym Asar: Shimon, to whom he gave the name Kefa,"
41,3,17,"and Ya'akov Ben-Zavdai and Yochanan, Ya'akov's brother. He gave to them the name Bnei-Regesh,"
41,3,18,"And Andrew and Philippos and Bar-Talmai, and Mattityahu, and T'oma, and Ya'akov Ben-Chalfai, and Taddia, and Shimon the Zealot,"
41,3,19,"and Yehudah from K'riot, the one who betrayed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ACCUSED OF CHILLUL HASHEM"
41,3,20,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach goes home; and again the multitude assembles, with the result that they were not able to have okhel."
41,3,21,"And when his own mishpochah heard of this, they went out to constrain him.  For they were saying, He is meshuga."
41,3,22,"And the Sofrim"
41,3,23,"But having called them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was speaking to them in meshalim"
41,3,24,"And if a malchut is divided against itself, it is not possible for that malchut to stand."
41,3,25,"And if a bais is divided against itself, it will not be possible for that bais to stand."
41,3,26,"And if Hasatan has risen up against himself and is divided, it is not possible for him to stand, but his end has arrived."
41,3,27,"But no one is able, having entered into the house of the strong man to plunder his possessions, unless first, he binds the strong man, and then he will plunder the house of the strong man. [Yeshayah 49:24,25]"
41,3,28,"Omein, I say to you that everything--the averos and the Chillul Hashem, whatever they may commit--of the bnei Adam will be granted selicha."
41,3,29,"But whoever commits Chillul Hashem gidduf against the Ruach Hakodesh, can never have selicha, but is guilty of a chet Olam."
41,3,30,"For they were saying, He has a ruach temei'ah. WHO ARE THE TRUE ACHIM OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH?"
41,3,31,"And the Em"
41,3,32,"And a multitude was sitting around him, and they are saying to him, Hinei! Your Em"
41,3,33,"And in reply to them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says, Who is the Em"
41,3,34,"And having looked around at the ones sitting around him, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says, Hinei! The Em"
41,3,35,"For whoever does the ratzon Hashem, this one is my brother and my sister and mother."
41,4,1,"And again Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach began to teach Torah beside the lake. And a huge multitude gathered together to him so that he got into a sirah"
41,4,2,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was teaching them with many meshalim"
41,4,3,"Listen.  Hinei! The Sower went out to sow"
41,4,4,"And it came about that when he went to sow, that some [seeds] fell beside the road. And the birds came and devoured it."
41,4,5,"And other [seeds] fell upon the rocky places where it did not have much soil, and ofen ort"
41,4,6,"And when the shemesh rose, it was scorched and, because it did not have a shoresh"
41,4,7,"And other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them, and it did not yield p'ri."
41,4,8,"And other seed fell into the adamah tovah and it was giving p'ri, rising up and growing, thirty, sixty and one hundredfold."
41,4,9,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
41,4,10,"And when he was alone, the Shneym Asar were asking him for a hezber"
41,4,11,"And he was saying to them. To you the raz"
41,4,12,"in order that `YIRU they may see and not have da'as V'SHIM'U they may hear and not have binah, lest they should turn and they should receive refu'ah and selicha.'"
41,4,13,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Do you not have da'as of the meaning of this mashal? Then how will you have binah of all the meshalim?"
41,4,14,"The one sowing sows the dvar Hashem."
41,4,15,"And these are the ones beside the road where the dvar Hashem is sown.  And when they hear it, ofen ort"
41,4,16,"And these are the ones sown upon the rocky places: when they hear the dvar, ofen ort"
41,4,17,"Yet they do not have a shoresh"
41,4,18,"And others are the ones sown among thorns.  These are the ones having heard the dvar,"
41,4,19,"And the worries of the Olam Hazeh and the seduction of osher"
41,4,20,"And these are the ones sown upon adamah tovah: they hear the dvar Hashem and are mekabel dvar Hashem and bear p'ri, thirty, sixty and one hundredfold."
41,4,21,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them. Surely a menorah is not brought out in order that it may be put under a measuring bucket or under the couch?  Rather, is it not brought out that it may be placed on the shulchan?"
41,4,22,"For there is not [anything] nistar"
41,4,23,"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."
41,4,24,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, Pay attention!  By what measure you measure it will be measured to you, and still more will be added to you."
41,4,25,"For whoever has, it will be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him."
41,4,26,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, Thus is the Malchut Hashem: like a man who casts seed upon the soil,"
41,4,27,"and goes to sleep b'lailah and arises b'yom, and the seed sprouts up and grows in such a way that he does not have da'as of how it does so."
41,4,28,"On its own, the soil bears p'ri: first the blade, then a head of grain, then full wheat in the head."
41,4,29,"But when the crop is ripe, ofen ort"
41,4,30,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, To what should we compare the Malchut Hashem or by what mashal may we present it?"
41,4,31,"The Malchut Hashem is like a mustard seed, which, when it is sown on the soil, is smaller [than] all the seeds on the earth."
41,4,32,"And when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater [than] all the plants of the garden and puts forth large branches, so that the OF HASHOMAYIM can nest under its shade."
41,4,33,"And with many such meshalim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshich was speaking to them the dvar Hashem as they were able to hear."
41,4,34,"But apart from meshalim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was not speaking to them.  Only privately, in a yechidus, was Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach explaining everything to his own talmidim.        REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE BAAL MOFET"
41,4,35,"And on that day, when erev had come, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake."
41,4,36,"And leaving the multitude, they took Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, just as he was, in the sirah"
41,4,37,"And there arose a fierce gale of wind and the waves were beating against the sirah"
41,4,38,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was in the stern on the cushion sleeping, and they woke him up, and they say to him, Rebbe, does it not matter to you that we are perishing?"
41,4,39,"And having been awakened, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach rebuked the wind, and he spoke to the lake, Sha!  Be still!  And there was a great calm."
41,4,40,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Why do you have   morech lev"
41,4,41,"And they were afraid with a terrible pachad"
41,5,1,"And they came to the other side of the lake, to the country of the Gerasenes."
41,5,2,"And as soon as Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach stepped out of the sirah"
41,5,3,"This man had"
41,5,4,"because often he had been bound with shackles and a kaval and the shackles and the kaval had been torn apart by him, and no one had the ko'ach to subdue him."
41,5,5,"And constantly, yomam valailah, among the kevarim and in the mountains, he was crying out and beating himself with stones."
41,5,6,"And, having seen Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach from afar, he ran and fell down before him."
41,5,7,"And having cried out with a kol gadol, he says, Mah lanu valach, Yehoshua, Ben HaElohim HaElyon?  I implore you by Hashem, [do] not torment me."
41,5,8,"For Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had been saying to him, Come out of the man, ruach temei'ah!"
41,5,9,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was questioning him, saying, What is your name? And he says to him, `Legion' [is] my name, for we are many!"
41,5,10,"And he begged Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach again and again not to exorcise him and banish him from that place."
41,5,11,"Now there was a large herd of chazirim feeding nearby on the hillside."
41,5,12,"And they"
41,5,13,"And he permitted them.  And having come out, the ruchot hatemei'ot entered into the chazirim.  And the herd of chazirim rushed down the slope into the lake, and there were about two thousand of them, and they were drowned in the lake. [Michoh 7:19]"
41,5,14,"And the herdsmen feeding them fled and reported it in the village and in the sadot"
41,5,15,"And they come to Yehoshua and they see the one that had been possessed by the shed sitting, clothed and in his right mind -- the very one having had the Legion!  And they were afraid."
41,5,16,"And the edat re'iyah"
41,5,17,"Then they began to implore Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to depart from their region."
41,5,18,"And as Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was stepping into the sirah"
41,5,19,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not permit him, but says to him, Go home to your people and report to them everything that Hashem has done for you and [that] he had rachmanim"
41,5,20,"And the man left and began to preach in the Decapolis everything that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had done for him, and everyone was amazed.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TZITZIT AND TAHARAT HAMISHPOCHAH: EMUNAH AS THE MEANS OF BRINGING WOMEN BACK FROM THE STATE OF ESCHATOLOGICAL NIDDAH"
41,5,21,"And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had crossed over again in the sirah"
41,5,22,"And one of the Roshei Beit HaKnesset comes -- Ya'ir was his name -- and, having seen Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, he falls down at his feet,"
41,5,23,"and he begs him earnestly saying, Biti"
41,5,24,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went with Ya'ir. And a large multitude were following him and they were pressing against Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
41,5,25,"And [there was] an isha having a flow of dahm shteym esreh shanah. [Vayikra 15:25-30]"
41,5,26,"And having suffered much by many rofim"
41,5,27,"And having heard about Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, she came up  behind him in the multitude, and touched his garment."
41,5,28,"For she was saying, If I may touch even the garments of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, I will receive refu'ah."
41,5,29,"And ofen ort"
41,5,30,"And ofen ort"
41,5,31,"And the talmidim of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach were saying to him, You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, `Who touched me?'"
41,5,32,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was looking around to see the one having done this."
41,5,33,"Now the isha, B'YIR'AH"
41,5,34,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to her, Bat, your emunah has brought you refu'ah.  Go in shalom and receive refu'ah from  your affliction."
41,5,35,"While Rebbe Malech HaMoshiach was still speaking, some came from the Rosh Beit HaKnesset, saying, Your yaldah is niftar, are you still causing a shter"
41,5,36,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having overheard what was being spoken, says to the Rosh Beit HaKnesset, Do not be afraid, only have emunah."
41,5,37,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach did not permit anyone to follow after him, except Kefa and Ya'akov and Yochanan, the brother of Ya'akov."
41,5,38,"And they come into the bais of the Rosh Beit HaKnesset, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach beheld much commotion and weeping and loud wailing."
41,5,39,"And having entered, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Why are you distressed and weeping?  The yaldah is not niftar but is only sleeping."
41,5,40,"And they began making leitzonus of him.  But having put everyone out, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach takes the abba of the na'arah and the immah and the ones with him, and goes into where the na'arah was."
41,5,41,"And having grasped the hand of the na'arah, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to her, Talitha Koum, which, being translated, means Little girl, to you I say, arise!"
41,5,42,"And ofen ort"
41,5,43,"And he gave orders to them earnestly that no one should have da'as of this.  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to give her some okhel."
41,6,1,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came out from there and comes into his shtetl and his talmidim follow him."
41,6,2,"And Shabbos having come, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to say shiurim in the shul, and many, listening, were amazed, saying, From where [did] this one get lernen, and what [is] the chochmah that has been given to this one?  And what gevurot are being done by his hands?"
41,6,3,"Is not this one the Naggar"
41,6,4,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, A navi is not without his kavod, except in his own shtetl and among his own mishpochah and in his own bais."
41,6,5,"And he was not able there to do many nissim, except on a few cholim he laid"
41,6,6,"And he wondered on account of their lack of emunah. And he was going around the shtetlach in a circuit, saying shiurim."
41,6,7,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach summons the Shneym Asar, and he began to send them out two by two, and he was giving to them samchut [over] the ruchot hatume'ot"
41,6,8,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave mitzot to them that they should take nothing on [the] derech except a mere walking stick -- not lechem, not a beggar's sack, nor a money belt;"
41,6,9,"but instead, to wear sandals, and not to take an extra kaftan."
41,6,10,"And he was saying to them, Wherever you enter into a bais, stay there until you leave that area."
41,6,11,"And whatever place does not give you the kabbalat panim, and does not listen to you, then, as you are leaving there, let it be NI'ER CHATZNO, shake off the dust of your feet, for an edut to them."
41,6,12,"And having gone out, they preached that bnei Adam should teshuva."
41,6,13,"And many shedim they were casting out, and they were anointing with shemen"
41,6,14,"And Herod the king heard of it, for the name of Yehoshua had become famous, and some were saying, Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva has been made to stand up alive from [the] mesim, and for this reason the nissim"
41,6,15,"But others were saying, It is Eliyahu.  And still others were saying, He is a navi, like one of the nevi'im of old. [Malachi 4:5]"
41,6,16,"But when Herod heard of it, he kept saying, Yochanan whom I beheaded has stood up alive from the mesim!"
41,6,17,"For Herod himself had sent and had Yochanan arrested and bound in the beis hasohar, on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother, Philippos, for he had married her."
41,6,18,"But Yochanan was saying to Herod, It is not mutar"
41,6,19,"And Herodias bore a grudge against Yochanan and desired to kill him. But she could not."
41,6,20,"For Herod feared Yochanan, knowing him [to be] a tzaddik and kadosh, and Herod was protecting Yochanan. And when Herod heard    Yochanan, he was greatly disturbed, and [yet] gladly Herod was listening to Yochanan."
41,6,21,"And, an opportune day having come, when Herod, on his birthday, gave a seudah for the court of his nobles, and the military commanders, and those of chashivut"
41,6,22,"And when his daughter entered and danced, she pleased Herod and the ones reclining at the seudah with him.  And the king said to the the girl, Ask me whatever you wish and I will give [it] to you."
41,6,23,"And he made an shevu'ah"
41,6,24,"And having gone out, she said to her mother, What should I ask [for]?  And her mother said, The rosh Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva."
41,6,25,"And having entered, ofen ort"
41,6,26,"And having become very sad, the king, on account of his shevu'ah and on account of the ones reclining at the seudah [with him], was unwilling to refuse her."
41,6,27,"And, ofen ort"
41,6,28,"And he brought the rosh Yochanan upon a platter and gave it to the young girl, and the young girl gave it to her mother."
41,6,29,"And, having heard this, Yochanan's talmidim came and carried away his geviyah and placed it in a kever.     REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TISH IN THE MIDBAR AND THE MANNA FROM SHOMAYIM SERVED AT HIS FARBRENGEN"
41,6,30,"And the Shluchim gathered together with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and reported to him everything which they did and which they had taught."
41,6,31,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Come away a while, you yourselves, for a yechidus in a quiet place for a Shabbaton.  For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time for okhel."
41,6,32,"And they departed in the sirah"
41,6,33,"And the people, recognizing them, saw them departing, and from all the shtetlach they ran there and arrived ahead of them."
41,6,34,"And having gotten out of the sirah"
41,6,35,"And when it was already a late hour, his talmidim came up to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and were saying, This place is desolate and already [it is] late."
41,6,36,"Send them away, in order that, having departed to the surrounding farms and shtetlach, they may buy for themselves what okhel they may eat."
41,6,37,"But in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, You yourselves give them [something] to eat.  And they say to him, Shall we go and spend two hundred denarii for lechem and give to them to eat? [Melachim Bais 4:42-44]"
41,6,38,"And Rebbe, Melech Hamoshiach says to them, How much lechem do you have?  Go [and] see. And knowing, the talmidim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach say, Chamesh, and dagim, shenayim."
41,6,39,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach commanded them to recline at tish, as it were, everyone group by group, on the green grass."
41,6,40,"And they reclined, group by group, in hundreds and in fifties."
41,6,41,"And, having taken the chamesh loaves and the shnei hadagim and looking up to Shomayim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said a berakhah, and having offered the betzi'at halechem, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was giving to his talmidim in order that they might set them before the people.  And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach divided the shnei hadagim among them all."
41,6,42,"And everyone ate, and they were satisfied,"
41,6,43,"And they picked up shirayim, shneym asar baskets full, and from the dagim."
41,6,44,"And those who had eaten the loaves numbered chamesh elafim.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE BAAL MOFET"
41,6,45,"And ofen ort"
41,6,46,"And having said a Shalom farewell to them, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach departed to the mountain to daven."
41,6,47,"And erev having come, the sirah"
41,6,48,"And having seen them laboring at the oars, for the wind was against them, about the fourth watch of halailah, Moshiach comes to them, walking on the lake. And he wanted to go by them."
41,6,49,"But having seen him on the lake, they thought that it is a ruach refa'im.  And they cried out;"
41,6,50,"for everyone saw him.  And ofen ort"
41,6,51,"And he got into the sirah"
41,6,52,"For they did not understand concerning the loaves [6:43], but their levavot had been hardened."
41,6,53,"And having crossed over onto the land, they came to Gennesaret and anchored [there]."
41,6,54,"And when they disembark from the sirah"
41,6,55,"And the people rushed everywhere in that whole region, and they began to carry about on their mats the cholim to where they heard he was."
41,6,56,"And wherever Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was entering into the shtetlach or into towns or into the countryside, thy laid the cholim in the marketplaces, entreating him that they might just touch the tzitzit of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  And as many as touched it were receiving refu'ah. [Bamidbar 15:38-41; Devarim 22:12]"
41,7,1,"And, when they had come down from Yerushalayim, the Perushim and some of the Sofrim come together around Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach,"
41,7,2,"and they had observed that some of his talmidim were eating their lechem with yadayim temei'ot, that is, unwashed hands."
41,7,3,"[For the Perushim, and indeed this was the Jewish minhag, do not eat without doing n'tilat yadayim and also observing the Masoret HaZekenim [the Torah Sheb'al peh]."
41,7,4,"And when they come from [the] marketplace, unless they do so, they do not eat.  And there are many other things which they have received in order to observe, such as the tevilah of cups and pitchers and copperpots.]"
41,7,5,"And the Perushim and the Sofrim question Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Why do your talmidim not follow the halakhah according to the Masoret HaZekenim, but eat their lechem with yadaym temei'ot?"
41,7,6,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Yeshayah rightly gave nevu'ah of you tzevu'im, as it has been written, HAAM HAZEH BISFATAV KIBDUNI V'LIBO RIKHAK MIMENI VATEHI YIRATAM OTI MITZVAT ANASHIM MELUMMADAH (This people with [their] lips honor me, but their heart is removed far away from me."
41,7,7,"And in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the mitzvot of men.) [Yeshayah 29:13]"
41,7,8,"Abandoning the mitzvat Hashem, you are holding to the Masoret HaBnei Adam."
41,7,9,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, You have a fine knack for setting aside the mitzvat Hashem in order that your own masorah might stand undisturbed."
41,7,10,"For Moshe [Rabbeinu] said, `KABED ES AVICHA V'ES IMMECHA'"
41,7,11,"But you say, `If a man says to his Av or to his Em, whatever by me you might have benefited is Korban' [that is, the taitsh"
41,7,12,"then no longer do you permit him to do anything for his Av  or his Em."
41,7,13,"You nullify and make void the dvar Hashem by means of your masorah you received. And you do many similar things."
41,7,14,"And having summoned again the multitude, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, Give ear to me and have binah."
41,7,15,"There is nothing outside of a ben Adam"
41,7,16,"missing fehlt/missing"
41,7,17,"And when he left the multitude and entered a bais, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim were asking him [about] the mashal."
41,7,18,"And he says to them, Are you so lacking in binah also? Do you not have binah that it is not what is outside and entering into the ben Adam that is able to make him tameh?"
41,7,19,"Because it does not enter into his lev, but into his stomach and goes out into the latrine, making all the okhel tohar."
41,7,20,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, It is the thing proceeding out of the ben Adam that makes him tameh."
41,7,21,"For from within the lev of the ben Adam comes evil cravings and makhshavot: then zenunim"
41,7,22,"ni'ufim"
41,7,23,"All these evil things proceed from within and make the ben Adam tameh.   THE EMUNAH OF THE GOYIM IN SPITE OF THE MECHITZAH OF GENDER AND NATIONALITY SEPARATING THEM FROM REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH"
41,7,24,"And from there Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach arose and departed to the district of Tzor and Tzidon. And having entered into a bais he wanted no one to have da'as, [yet] he was not able to escape notice."
41,7,25,"But, after hearing about Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, ofen ort"
41,7,26,"Now the woman was a Yevanit"
41,7,27,"And he was saying to her, Rishonah allow the banim to be satisfied, for it is not tov to take the lechem of the yeladim and throw it to kelevim."
41,7,28,"But she replied, saying, Ken, Adoni, but even the kelevim under the shulchan eat from the crumbs of the yeladim."
41,7,29,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to her, Because of this teshuva"
41,7,30,"And having departed to her bais, she found the yaldah lying on the bed, the shed having gone out. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH DEPARTS TO LAKE KINNERET"
41,7,31,"When he returned from the region of Tzor, and then went through Tzidon to Lake Kinneret within the region of the Decapolis,"
41,7,32,"they bring to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach [a man who was] cheresh-illem"
41,7,33,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took him aside from the multitude by himself and put his fingers into his ears, and spat, and with that touched the tongue of the mute man;"
41,7,34,"and, looking up to Shomayim with a deep sigh, he says to him, Ephphatha,"
41,7,35,"Ofen ort"
41,7,36,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was directing them not to tell anyone. But the more he ordered them, they were proclaiming [it] all the more."
41,7,37,"And they were all astonished beyond all measure, saying, He has done all things tov me'od, and he makes even the chereshim"
41,8,1,"In yamim hahem"
41,8,2,"I have rachamanut"
41,8,3,"and if I send them away hungry to their batim, they will give out on the way; and some of them have come from faraway."
41,8,4,"And his talmidim answered him, From where will anyone be able to find enough lechem to feed these ones here in the midbar? [Bamidbar 11:21]"
41,8,5,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was asking them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Shevah."
41,8,6,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach directed the multitude to recline at tish, as it were, on the ground. And having taken the sheva kikrot"
41,8,7,"And they also had a few small dagim.  And after he had made the berakhah over them, he directed these to be served as well."
41,8,8,"And they ate and were satisfied. And there was an abundance of shirayim"
41,8,9,"And there were approximately arba'at elafim"
41,8,10,"And ofen ort"
41,8,11,"And the Perushim came out and began to argue with him, seeking from him an ot min HaShomayim"
41,8,12,"And sighing deeply in his ruach, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Why does hador hazeh"
41,8,13,"And having left them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach again embarked and departed to the other side."
41,8,14,"And his talmidim had forgotten to take lechem and did not have anything except one kikar"
41,8,15,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was giving orders to them, saying, Take care!  Beware of the se'or"
41,8,16,"And the talmidim were beginning to discuss among themselves that they do not have [any] kikrot"
41,8,17,"And aware of this, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Why are you discussing that you do not have kikrot? Do you not yet have binah? nor comprehend?  Have your levavot fallen into timtum halev"
41,8,18,"EINAYIM LAKHEM V'LO TIRU V'OZNAYIM LAKHEM V'LO TISHMA'U"
41,8,19,"when I offered the bezi'at halechem with the chamesh kikrot for the chameshet ha'alafim, how many baskets of shirayim you picked up?  And they say to him, Shneym Asar."
41,8,20,"And when I offered the bezi'at halechem over the shevah for the arba'at haalafim, how many baskets full of shirayim did you pick up? And they say to him, Shiva."
41,8,21,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, Do you not yet have binah?"
41,8,22,"And they come to Beit-Tzaidah. And they bring to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach an ivver"
41,8,23,"And having grasped the hand of the ivver, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took him outside the shtetl; and, having put spittle on his eyes, [and] having laid hands upon him, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was questioning him, Do you see anything?"
41,8,24,"And after looking up, the ivver was was saying, I see bnei Adam--they look like trees walking!"
41,8,25,"Then again Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach placed his hands upon his eyes; and the man looked intently and was restored, and  was seeing everything clearly."
41,8,26,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sent the man to his bais, saying, Do not even enter the shtetl.    THE ANI MA'AMIN OF THE CORRECT"

41,8,28,"And the talmidim spoke to him, saying, `Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva;' and others say, `Eliyahu;' but others, `One  of the nevi'im.' [Malachi 4:5]"
41,8,29,"And he continued questioning them, But who do you say that I am?  In reply, Kefa says to him, You are the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
41,8,30,"And he warned them to tell no one about him. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEGINS TO GIVE THE NEVU'AH"
41,8,31,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to teach them that it is necessary [for] the Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] to suffer many things and to be rejected by the Zekenim and the Rashei Hakohanim"
41,8,32,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was speaking about the matter plainly. And Shimon Kefa took him aside and began to rebuke him."
41,8,33,"But having turned around and having looked at his talmidim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach rebuked Kefa, and says, Get behind me, Hasatan; for you are not putting your machshavot"
41,8,34,"And having summoned the multitude along with his talmidim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, If anyone wishes to follow after me, let him make hakhchashah"
41,8,35,"For whoever wishes to save his nefesh will lose it; but whoever loses his nefesh for my sake and for the sake of the Besuras HaGeulah will save it."
41,8,36,"For how is the ben Adam nehneh"
41,8,37,"For what shall a ben Adam give in exchange [for] his neshamah?"
41,8,38,"For whoever feels bushah"

41,9,2,"And after shishah yamim Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach takes Kefa and Ya'akov and Yochanan, and brought them up a high mountain  by themselves. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was transfigured before them;"
41,9,3,"and his garments became like a dazzlingly brilliant kittel, gantz"
41,9,4,"And Eliyahu Hanavi appeared to them along with Moshe"
41,9,5,"And in reply, Kefa says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Rebbe, it is tov [for] us to be here, and let us make shalosh sukkot, one for you and one for Moshe"
41,9,6,"Kefa did not know what he was answering, for they were tzufloigen"
41,9,7,"And there came an anan"
41,9,8,"And suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one in their company any more, except only Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
41,9,9,"And [as] they were coming down from the mountain, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave instructions to them that they should tell no one what they saw, except when the Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] should arise in his Techiyas HaMesim."
41,9,10,"And they retained Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's dvar, discussing among themselves what he might mean by his Techiyas HaMesim."
41,9,11,"And they were questioning Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, Why is it that the Sofrim"
41,9,12,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Eliyahu Hanavi  indeed does come rishonah and brings tikkun to all things.  And yet how is it written of the Ben HaAdam that he must suffer many things and be NIVZEH VACHADAL"
41,9,13,"But I say to you, that Eliyahu Hanavi has indeed come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, just as it has been written concerning him. [Melachim Alef 19:2, 10; Malachi 3:23f"
41,9,14,"And when they returned to the talmidim, they saw a great multitude around them and [the] Sofrim"
41,9,15,"And ofen ort"
41,9,16,"And he questioned them, About what are you arguing with them?"
41,9,17,"And one of the multitude answered Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Rabbi, I brought beni"
41,9,18,"And whenever it seizes him, it throws into convulsions and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. And I told your talmidim in order that they might cast it out, and they did not have the ko'ach."
41,9,19,"In reply to them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says, O dor with emunah, how long will I be with you? How long will I put up with you? Bring the bochur to me!"
41,9,20,"They brought the bochur to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  And when the shed saw Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, it threw the bochur into convulsions, and, falling to the ground, the bochur began rolling around foaming at the mouth."

41,9,22,"And also it has often thrown him into the aish and into the mayim that it might destroy him. But if you can do anything, grant rachamim upon us and help us!"
41,9,23,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, `If you can?`!! All things are possible to him who has emunah!"
41,9,24,"Ofen ort"
41,9,25,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having seen that a multitude was gathering, rebuked the ruach hatemei'ah, saying to it, You cheresh-illem"
41,9,26,"And after shrieking out a shrai"
41,9,27,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having grasped the hand of the bochur, lifted him up; and the bochur stood up."
41,9,28,"And, having entered into a bais, his talmidim began questioning Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach privately, Why were we not able to perform the gerush shedim"
41,9,29,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, This kind of gerush shedim is accomplished only by davening tefillos.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S SECOND NEVU'AH OF HIS SUFFERING AND THE KAVOD TO FOLLOW"
41,9,30,"And from there they went forth and were passing through the Galil, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not want anyone to have da'as."
41,9,31,"For Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was teaching his talmidim and was saying to them, The Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] is to be betrayed into the hands of bnei Adam, and MOSHIACH YIKARET"
41,9,32,"But they were did binah concerning this dvar, and they were afraid to inquire further. A QUESTION FOR REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH: WHO ARE THE GEDOLIM?"
41,9,33,"And they came to K'far-Nachum; And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was in the bais, he began questioning them, What were you arguing about baderech?"
41,9,34,"But they were keeping silent, for baderech they were discussing with one another which of the talmidim was hagadol."

41,9,36,"And having taken a yeled, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach set him in [the] center of them, and, having taken the yeled into his arms, he said to them,"
41,9,37,"Whoever receives one yeled such as this bishmi"
41,9,38,"Yochanan said to him, Rebbe, we saw someone performing a gerush shedim in your name, and we were trying to stop him, because he was not one of your chasidim. [Bamidbar 11:27-29]"
41,9,39,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Do not stop him, for no one who will accomplish nifla'ot bishmi"
41,9,40,"For the one who is not our mitnagged"
41,9,41,"For whoever gives you to drink a kos of mayim bishmi"

41,10,1,"And from there, having got up, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes  into the region of Yehudah and on the other side of the Yarden, and again multitudes gather to him, and as was his minhag"
41,10,2,"And, having approached, the Perushim, testing him, were asking him, Is it mutar"
41,10,3,"But in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, What mitzva did Moshe [Rabbeinu] give you?"
41,10,4,"And they said, Moshe Rabbeinu made it mutar"
41,10,5,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Because of the hardness of your levavot, he wrote you this mitzva. [Tehillim 95:8]"

41,10,11,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Whoever gives a get to his isha and marries another, commits ni'uf"
41,10,12,"And if she gets a gerushim"

41,10,20,"And the man was saying to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Rabbi, from kinder-yoren I have been shomer mitzvot, keeping all these things."
41,10,21,"And looking at him and having ahavah for his neshamah, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, One thing you lack: go and sell all your possessions and give to the aniyim"
41,10,22,"But at the dvar haMoshiach, his face turned gloomy and he departed with agmat nefesh, for he had many possessions."
41,10,23,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, looking around, says to his talmidim, How difficult it will be for the ashirim to enter the Malchut Hashem! [Tehillim 52:7, 62:10]"
41,10,24,"And the talmidim were amazed at his dvarim. But again Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, in reply, says to them, Yeladim, how difficult it is to enter into the Malchut Hashem."
41,10,25,"It is easier [for] a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for an ashir"
41,10,26,"And they were even more amazed, saying to one another, Then who with the Yeshu'at Eloheinu is able to be saved?"
41,10,27,"Having looked at them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says, With bnei Adam [this is] impossible, but not with Hashem. For all things are possible with Hashem."
41,10,28,"Shimon Kefa began to say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Hinei! We left everything and have followed you!"
41,10,29,"Yehoshua said, Omein, I say to you, there is no one who left bais or achim or achayot or imma or abba or banim or sadot for the sake of me and for the sake of the Besuras HaGeulah,"
41,10,30,"but that he shall receive a hundredfold now in the Olam Hazeh, batim"
41,10,31,"And many Rishonim will be Acharonim; and the Acharonim, will be Rishonim. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND HIS THIRD NEVU'AH CONCERNING HIS MAVET AND TECHIYAS HAMESIM"
41,10,32,"And they were on the derech making aliyah leregel to Yerushalayim, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was leading out, walking ahead of them, and they were astounded, and the ones following were afraid. And again Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took the Shneym Asar aside for a yechidus and began to tell them what was to happen to him,"
41,10,33,"saying, Hinei, we are making aliyah leregel to Yerushalayim, and the Ben Adam will be betrayed to the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim"
41,10,34,"And they will mock him and spit on him and scourge him and will kill [him], and on the Yom HaShelishi he in his Techiyas HaMesim stand up alive again. YOCHANAN AND YA'AKOV: SELFISH AMBITION AND THE KOS OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH"
41,10,35,"And Ya'akov and Yochanan, the banim of Zavdai, approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying to him, Rebbe, we wish that whatever bakosha"
41,10,36,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, What do you wish me to do for you?"
41,10,37,"And they said to him, Grant to us that one may sit limin of you"
41,10,38,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, You do not have da'as of what you ask. Are you able to drink the kos which I drink or the tevilah in which I am submerged? [Iyov 38:2]"
41,10,39,"And they said to him, We are able.  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, The kos which I drink you shall drink; and you shall have the tevilah in which I am submerged."
41,10,40,"But to sit limin or lismol of me is not mine to grant, but for the ones for whom it has been prepared."
41,10,41,"And hearing this, the Asarah"
41,10,42,"And having summoned them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, You have da'as that among the Goyim those whom they recognize as their moshlim"
41,10,43,"However, it is not so among you. He who wishes to become gadol among you must be your mesharet."
41,10,44,"And whoever wishes to be Rishon among you must be eved of all."
41,10,45,"For even the Ben HaAdam"
41,10,46,"And they come to Yericho. And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach  was going forth from Yericho with his talmidim and a great multitude, Bar-Timai [son of Timai], an ivver kabbetsan"
41,10,47,"And when he heard that it was Yehoshua from Natzeret coming, he began to cry out and to shout, Ben Dovid Yehoshua, chaneini!"
41,10,48,"And many were rebuking him that he should shekit, but he kept crying out all the more, Ben Dovid, chaneini!"
41,10,49,"Having stopped, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Summon him here.  And they called the ivver, saying to him, Chazak! Cheer up! He is calling you!"
41,10,50,"And having tossed aside his kaftan, and having jumped up, he came to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
41,10,51,"And in reply, Yehoshua said, What do you wish that I may do for you?  And the ivver said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Rabboni, that I may see."
41,10,52,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Go, your emunah  has brought you tikkun. And ofen ort"
41,11,1,"And when they draw near to Yerushalayim at Beit-Pagey and  Beit-Anyah near the Mount of Olives, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sends two of his talmidim,"
41,11,2,"and says to them, Go into the shtetl ahead of you, and ofen ort"
41,11,3,"And if anyone says to you, `Why are you doing this?` you say `The Adon has need of it and will send it again here.`"
41,11,4,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim left and found an AYIR"
41,11,5,"And some of by-standers were saying to them, What are you doing untying the AYIR?"
41,11,6,"And the talmidim spoke to them just as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had instructed them.  And the by-standers permitted them."
41,11,7,"And the talmidim brought the AYIR to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and they lay upon it their garments, and he sat upon it."
41,11,8,"And many spread their garments on the derech, but others spread leafy branches they had cut from the sadot."
41,11,9,"And the vanguard and rearguard of the procession were crying out, HOSHAN NAH"
41,11,10,"A berakhah on the coming Malchut Dovid Avinu!  Hoshan nah in the highest!"
41,11,11,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach entered into Yerushalayim into the Beis HaMikdash and, having looked around at everything, and, the hour now being late, he went out to Beit-Anyah with the Shneym Asar.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH CLEANSES THE BEIS HAMIKDASH--THE AITZ TE'ENAH IS CURSED"
41,11,12,"And on the next day, when they came from Bethany, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was hungry."
41,11,13,"And having seen in the distance an aitz te'enah"
41,11,14,"And in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to it, May no one ever be nourished from p'ri from you again! And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim were listening."
41,11,15,"Then they came to Yerushalayim.  And having entered the Beis HaMikdash, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to drive out the ones buying and selling in the Beis HaMikdash, and he overturned the shulchanot"
41,11,16,"And he was not allowing anyone to carry things through the Beis HaMikdash."
41,11,17,"And he was teaching Torah and he was saying to them, Has it not been written, BEITI BEIT TEFILLAH YIKAREI L'KHOL HA'AMMIM"
41,11,18,"And the Rashei Hakohanim"
41,11,19,"And when it became late, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and his talmidim went out of the city."
41,11,20,"And in the boker early, as they passed by, they saw the aitz te'enah"
41,11,21,"And, having remembered, Shimon Kefa says to him, Rebbe, look, the aitz te'enah"
41,11,22,"And in reply Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Have emunah in Hashem."
41,11,23,"Omein, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, be lifted up and be thrown into the sea, and does not waver in his lev but has emunah that what he says happens, so it will be for him."
41,11,24,"For this reason, I say to you, everything for which you daven tefillos, everything you request in prayer, have emunah that you have received it, and so it will be for you."
41,11,25,"And when you stand davening, grant selicha if something you hold against someone, in order that your Avinu sh'baShomayim may grant you selicha for your peisha'im."
41,11,26,"THE SAMCHUT OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS QUESTIONED BY THE SANHEDRIN"
41,11,27,"And again they come into Yerushalayim. And in the Beis Hamikdash, [when] Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was walking about, the Rashei Hakohanim"
41,11,28,"And they were saying to him, By what kind of samchut do you do these things? Or who gave to you this samchut that you may do these things?"
41,11,29,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, I will ask you one dvar"
41,11,30,"the tevilah [of teshuva] of Yochanan--was it from Shomayim or from bnei Adam? Answer me!"
41,11,31,"And they were discussing among themselves, saying, If we say, from Shomayim, he will say, `Why then did you not with him have emunah?'"
41,11,32,"But [if] we say from bnei Adam?--they were afraid of the multitude, for everyone was considering Yochanan b'emes a navi."
41,11,33,"And in reply to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, they say, We do not have da'as.  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Neither will I tell you by what kind of samchut I do these things."
41,12,1,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to speak to them in meshalim. A man, a Ba'al Bayit, planted a kerem"
41,12,2,"And the Ba'al Bayit sent to the tenants, the koremim, in the season [of Katsir] an eved in order that from the koremim he might receive from the perot of the kerem."
41,12,3,"But they seized the eved and they beat him and sent him away empty."
41,12,4,"And again the Ba'al Bayit sent to the tenants, the koremim, another eved; and that one they struck on the rosh and insulted."
41,12,5,"And the Ba'al Bayit sent another; and that one they killed, and many others, some beating, and others killing."
41,12,6,"Still he had one BEN AHUV [9:7]. Lemaskana"
41,12,7,"But those koremim said to themselves, `This one is the Yoresh"
41,12,8,"And having seized [him], they killed him and threw him out of the kerem."
41,12,9,"What then will the Ba'al Bayit of the kerem do?  He will come and destroy the koremim and will give the kerem to others."
41,12,10,"Have you not read this Kitvei Hakodesh? EVEN MA'ASU HABONIM HAY'TAH LEROSH PINAH; MEI'ET HASHEM HAY'TAH ZOT, HI NIFLAT B'EINEINU (The stone which the ones building rejected, this one has come to be for [the] capstone of [the] corner."

41,12,12,"And they were seeking to seize him, and they were afraid of the multitude, for they knew that against them he told the mashal. And leaving him, they went away.    REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND HIS GAINSAYERS: AN ATTEMPT TO ENTRAP REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH CONCERNING TAXES AND CAESAR"
41,12,13,"And they send to him some of the Perushim and the Herodians in order that they might catch him in a dvar."
41,12,14,"And having come, they say to him, Rabbi, we have da'as that you are an ish of Emes and you do not show deference toward anyone.  Ki ein masso panim with you. but rather on the Derech Hashem you give Divrei Torah in Emes. Is it mutar"
41,12,15,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having seen their tzevi'ut"
41,12,16,"And they brought [one].  And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Whose demut is this and whose inscription?  And they said to him, Caesar's."
41,12,17,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, The things of Caesar, give to Caesar, and the things of Hashem [give] to Hashem. And they were amazed at Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. THE SHEILAH"
41,12,18,"And [the] Tzedukim come to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, the ones who say that there is not to be a Techiyas HaMesim, and they were questioning him, saying,"
41,12,19,"Rabbi, Moshe"
41,12,20,"Now there were shiva achim. And the first took a wife and, dying, did not leave a descendant."
41,12,21,"And the second took her and he died, not having left behind a descendant. And the third likewise."
41,12,22,"And the shiva did not leave a descendant."
41,12,23,"In the Techiyas HaMesim, when they are made to stand up alive, of which of them will she be [the] isha? For shiva had her [as] wife."
41,12,24,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, said to them, Is not this the reason you are in error, having da'as neither of the Kitvei Hakodesh nor of the gevurat Hashem?"
41,12,25,"But concerning the Mesim that are made to stand up alive, they do not marry nor are they given in nissuin"
41,12,26,"But concerning the Mesim, that they are made to stand up alive, have you not read in the sefer of Moshe Rabbeinu at the bush, how Hashem spoke to him, saying, ANOCHI ELOHEI AVRAHAM ELOHEI YITZCHAK V'ELOHEI YA'AKOV"
41,12,27,"Hashem is not the G-d of the Mesim but of the Chayyim. You are greatly mistaken.  THE TALMID CHACHAM"
41,12,28,"And one of the Sofrim"

And no one was daring to put a sh'eilah in front of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach again.    REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH GIVES US THE TRUE DAAS TORAH INTERPRETATION OF TEHILLIM 110:1"
41,12,35,"While Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying shiurim in the Beis Hamikdash, he was saying How is it that the Sofrim"
41,12,36,"Dovid himself said by the Ruach Hakodesh, `NE'UM HASHEM L'ADONI: SHEV LIMINI, AD ASHIT OYVECHA HADOM L'RAGLECHA`"
41,12,37,"Dovid himself calls Moshiach `Adon;` how then is Moshiach [merely] ben Dovid? And the large multitude found it a huge oneg to listen to him.   REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ATTACKS VAIN TRAPPINGS OF CHASHIVUT IN THE SHUL AS WELL AS ABUSES OF SAMCHUT"
41,12,38,"And in his torah, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, Beware of the Sofrim"
41,12,39,"and places of honor in the shuls and places of honor at the seudot"
41,12,40,"Beware particularly of the ones devouring the batim"
41,12,41,"And having sat [down] opposite the Beis Hamikdash Otzar"
41,12,42,"And a poor almanah came and threw [in] two leptas, which is a kodrantes."
41,12,43,"And having summoned his talmidim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach   said to them, Omein, I say to you that this poor almanah has put in more tzedakah than all those contributing to the Otzar,"
41,12,44,"for everyone threw in from their abundance, but this almanah from her need has put in everything she had, all her michyah"
41,13,1,"And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was going out from the Beis HaMikdash, one of his talmidim says to him, Hinei!  Rebbe, what  large stones and impressive binyanim"

41,13,4,"Tell us when these things will be and what [will be] the ot"
41,13,5,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to say to them, Beware lest anyone deceive you."
41,13,6,"For many will come in my name [arrogating my title and authority as Moshiach] saying I am [here].  And they will deceive many. [Yirmeyah 29:8]"
41,13,7,"But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled. It is necessary for these things to occur, but it is not yet HaKetz"
41,13,8,"For there will be an intifada of ethnic group against ethnic group and malchut against malchut, there will be earthquakes in place after place, [and] there will be famines. These things are but the beginning of the Chevlei [Moshiach]."
41,13,9,"But as for yourselves, take heed and be careful.  For they will hand you over to the sanhedrin and in the shuls you will be beaten and before moshlim"
41,13,10,"And it is necessary that the Besuras HaGeulah first be proclaimed to all nations."
41,13,11,"And when they arraign you and hand you over for trial, do not be worried beforehand about what you might say, but whatever is given to you in that hour, this you shall say, for it is not you yourselves who are the ones speaking, but the Ruach Hakodesh."

41,13,33,"Beware, stay shomer, for you do not have da'as when the time is."
41,13,34,"It is like a man, when departing on a journey and leaving his bais and, having put his avadim in charge, each with his assigned avodas, gives orders to the sho'er"

41,14,3,"And he was in Beit-Anyah at the bais of Shimon the leper, reclining at tish, and an isha came, having an alabaster flask of costly mishcha"
41,14,4,"Now some were there who in ka'as said to one another, For what reason has this waste of mishcha taken place?"
41,14,5,"For this mishcha was able to be sold for more than three hundred denarii and to be given to the aniyim.  And they were reproaching her."
41,14,6,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Leave her alone. Why are you bringing about difficulty for the isha? Has she not performed one of the Gemilut Chasadim on me?"
41,14,7,"For always the aniyim you have with you, and when you wish you are able to do ma'asim tovim for them, but me you do not always have. [Devarim 15:11]"
41,14,8,"With what she had she did all she could. She prepared ahead of time to anoint my basar for the kevurah"

41,14,29,"But Shimon Kefa said to him, Even if everyone will fall away, yet I will not."
41,14,30,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, Omein, I say to you, that you today, balailah hazeh"
41,14,31,"But Kefa kept saying with vehemence, If it is neccessary for me to die for you al kiddush ha-Shem, by no means will I make hakhchashah"
41,14,32,"And they come to a place of which the name [was] Gat-Sh'manim and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to his talmidim, Sit down here while I daven."
41,14,33,"And he takes Kefa and Ya'akov and Yochanan with him and he began to be distressed and to be troubled."
41,14,34,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, My agmat nefesh is great, even to the point of mavet. Remain here and stay awake and shomer."
41,14,35,"And having gone forth a little, he was falling on the ground and was davening tefillos that, if it is possible, this sha'ah might pass from him."
41,14,36,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, Abba, Avi, all things [are] possible for you. Take away this KOS [YESHAYAH 51:17] from me. But not what I will, but what you [will]."
41,14,37,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes and finds them sleeping, and he says to Shimon Kefa, Are you sleeping? Were you not chozek to stay awake one hour?"
41,14,38,"Stay shomer and daven that you may not enter lidey nisayon. Indeed the ruach [is] ready but the basar [is] weak."
41,14,39,"And again Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went away and davened the same dvarim as before.[14:36]"
41,14,40,"And once again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were falling shut, and they did not have da'as of what they might answer him."
41,14,41,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes the shlishit"
41,14,42,"Get up, let us go. Behold the one betraying me has drawn near.     THE HANDING OVER OF THE SEH HAELOHIM, REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH, THE PESACH KORBAN"
41,14,43,"And, ofen ort"
41,14,44,"Now the one betraying Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had given a signal to them, saying, Whomever I may give the neshikah"
41,14,45,"And when he came, he ofen ort"
41,14,46,"And they laid their hands on him and arrested him."
41,14,47,"But one of those standing by drew his cherev and struck the servant of the Kohen Gadol and cut off his ear."
41,14,48,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered and said to them, Do you come out swords and clubs as against a ganav to arrest me?"
41,14,49,"Every day I was with you in the Beis HaMikdash teaching Torah and you did not arrest me; but let the Kitvei Hakodesh be fulfilled. [Yeshayah 53:7-12]"
41,14,50,"And, having left Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, everyone fled."
41,14,51,"And a certain bochur was following along with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and the bochur was wearing nothing but a linen garment around his naked body, and they seized the bochur."
41,14,52,"But the bochur ran away naked, leaving the linen garment behind.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEFORE THE SANHEDRIN, THE BEGINNING OF HIS TZA'AR"
41,14,53,"And they led away Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to the Kohen Gadol and all the Rashei Hakohanim"
41,14,54,"And Shimon Kefa from a distance followed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach right into the courtyard of the Kohen Gadol.  And Kefa was sitting together with the servants and warming himself near the ohr of the aish."
41,14,55,"And the Rashei Hakohanim"
41,14,56,"For many gave edut sheker against Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and the eduyot"
41,14,57,"And some, taking the stand, were giving edut sheker against him, saying,"
41,14,58,"We heard him saying, `I will bring churban to this Beis Hamikdash made with human hands, and, after shalosha yamim, another, not made with hands, I will build."
41,14,59,"So their eduyot was not identical."
41,14,60,"And having stood up in their midst, the Kohen Gadol questioned Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, Do you not answer anything to what these bear solemn edut"
41,14,61,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was silent and did not answer anything. [Yeshayah 53:7-8]  Again the Kohen Gadol was questioning him and says to him, Are you the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, HaBen Hamevorakh?"
41,14,62,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Ani hu, and you will see the BEN HAADAM [Daniel 7:13-14] YOSHEV LIMIN HaGevurah [Tehilllim 110:1] UVA IM ANENEI HASHOMAYIM"
41,14,63,"And the Kohen Gadol, making the keriah"
41,14,64,"You heard him commit Chillul Hashem gidduf"
41,14,65,"And some began to spit on Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and to cover his face and to strike him and to say to him, Let's hear a dvar nevu'ah! And the shomrim took custody of him by slapping Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  KEFA MAKES HAKHCHASHAH"
41,14,66,"And Shimon Kefa being below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the Kohen Gadol comes by."
41,14,67,"And having seen Kefa warming himself, having looked him over, she says, You also were with the one from Natzeret, Yehoshua!"
41,14,68,"But he denied [it], saying, I do not have da'as nor binah of what you are saying. And he walked away and went outside into the entryway and a tarnegol crowed."
41,14,69,"And the maid, having seen him, began again to say to the ones having stood by, This one is one of them!"
41,14,70,"But again he made hakhchashah"
41,14,71,"And Kefa began to speak a kelala and to swear, I do not have da'as of this man--I don't know the one of whom you speak!"
41,14,72,"And ofen ort"
41,15,1,"And as soon as it was boker, the Rashei Hakohanim"
41,15,2,"And Pilate questioned Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Are you the Melech haYehudim? And, in reply, he says, You say so."
41,15,3,"And the Rashei Hakohanim were accusing Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach [of] many things."
41,15,4,"And Pilate again questioned him, saying, Do you not answer anything? Look how many things they accuse you [of]."
41,15,5,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach no longer answered anything, so Pilate was astounded. [Yeshayah 53:7]  THOUGH IT IS PESACH AND NOT YOM KIPPUR, REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH FULFILLS A YOM KIPPUR MOTIF IN THE QUESTION OF KAPPARAH IN TWO SONS OF THE FATHER, ONE FOR HASHEM, ONE FOR AZAZEL"
41,15,6,"Now [at] every Chag he was releasing to them one prisoner for whom they were making request."
41,15,7,"Now there was the one being called Bar-Abba, who had been imprisoned with his fellow insurrectionists and who, at the time of the Mered"
41,15,8,"So the crowd came and began to ask Pilate to do for them just as in the past was his custom."
41,15,9,"But Pilate answered them, saying, Do you wish [that] I should release to you the Melech haYehudim?"
41,15,10,"For Pilate knew that because of kinah"
41,15,11,"But the Rashei Hakohanim incited the crowd that Pilate should instead release Bar-Abba to them."
41,15,12,"But Pilate, in reply again, was saying to them, What then do you wish [that] I should do with the one whom you call the Melech HaYehudim?"
41,15,13,"And again they cried out, Let him be hanged on HaAitz! [Devarim 21:22]"
41,15,14,"But Pilate was saying to them, Why? What ra'ah has he committed? But they all the more cried out, Let him be hanged on HaAitz! [Devarim 21:22]"
41,15,15,"So Pilate, desiring to placate the crowd, released to them Bar-Abba, and handed over Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to be scourged [with the flagellum] and to be hanged on HaAitz. [Devarim 21:22] REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S KETER OF THORNS [YESHAYAH 53:6]; THE  COHORT OF THE ARMY OF THE GOYIM IS GATHERED AGAINST MOSHIACH"
41,15,16,"And the chaiyalim"
41,15,17,"And they clothe him [in royal] purple and place upon him a keter of thorns that they had woven together."
41,15,18,"And they began to greet Him, Hail, Melech HaYehudim!"
41,15,19,"And they were striking him [on] the rosh  with a staff and they were spitting on him and bending their knees and bowing down before him. [Tehillim 22:8,17]"
41,15,20,"After mocking him, they stripped him of [royal] purple and clothed him in his garments. And they lead him out that they might pierce him and hang him on HaAitz. [Devarim 21:22]  BEING PRESSED INTO SERVICE TO HELP BEAR REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S AITZ"
41,15,21,"And a certain Shimon from Cyrene was passing by, who was coming in from [the] countryside.  He was the father of Alexander and Rufus. The chaiyalim requisition him in order that he might carry Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's Aitz . [Devarim 21:23; 27:26; Yeshayah 53:4-5]  THE HAGBA"
41,15,22,"And they bring Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to a place called Gulgotha, which means, being translated, `Place of the Skull.`"
41,15,23,"And they were giving to him yayin having been mixed with myrrh, but this one did not take it. [Tehillim 69:22"
41,15,24,"And they hanged Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach on HaAitz and YICHALLEKU VEGADAI"
41,15,25,"Now it was [the] third hour when they hanged Rebbe, Melech  HaMoshiach on HaAitz."
41,15,26,"And the inscription of the charge against him was inscribed above his rosh, HaMelech HaYehudim."
41,15,27,"And with him they also nailed, each to his own aitz, shnei shodedim, one on [the] right and one on [the] left of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
41,15,28,"missing fehlt/missing"
41,15,29,"And the ones passing by were reviling him and shaking their heads and saying, Ha! The one bringing churban on the Beis HaMikdash and rebuilding [it] in shalosha yamim, [Tehillim 22:7; 109:25]"
41,15,30,"Save yourself! Come down from the aitz!"
41,15,31,"Likewise, also, the Rashei Hakohanim along with the Sofrim were also mocking him, saying. He saved others, but himself he is not able to save. [Tehillim 22:7]"
41,15,32,"Let the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, let the Rebbe Melech Yisroel, let [him] come down now from the aitz, in order that we may see and have emunah!  And the ones having been hanged on the aitz on either side of him were reproaching him. [Markos 8:31]"
41,15,33,"And when the sixth hour came [high noon], it became choshech over kol ha'aretz until [the] ninth hour. [Amos 8:9]"
41,15,34,"And at the ninth hour, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach cried out in a kol gadol, Eloi, Eloi lamah sabachthani? which means, being translated, ELI ELI LAMAH AZAVTANI? (My G-d, my G-d,  why have you forsaken me? [Tehillim 22:1]"
41,15,35,"And some of the ones having been standing nearby and having heard, were saying, Hinei! He calls for Eliyahu HaNavi!"
41,15,36,"And someone having run and having filled a sponge with CHOMETZ"
41,15,37,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having uttered a kol gadol and having breathed his last, expired."
41,15,38,"And the parochet [in the Heikhal] in the Beis haMikdash was torn in two from top to bottom."
41,15,39,"And the centurion, having stood nearby opposite Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and having seen that he expired this way, said Truly, this man was the Ben HaElohim!"
41,15,40,"And there were also nashim looking on from a distance, among whom [were] Miryam from Magdala, and Miryam the Imma of the younger Ya'akov and of Yosi, and Shlomit. [Tehillim 38:11]"
41,15,41,"They were with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach in the Galil and they had been following him [as talmidat] and serving him, and there were many other Jewish women who with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had made their aliyah leregel up to Yerushalayim.        REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S OWN CHEVRAH KADDISHA FORMS TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE KEVURAH OF THE NIFTAR"
41,15,42,"And already, erev fast approaching, vi-bahlt"
41,15,43,"Yosef of Ramatayim, a member of the Sanhedrin and a man of chashivut"
41,15,44,"And Pilate was amazed that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was already niftar, and Pilate summoned the centurion to question him whether Yehoshua was niftar already."
41,15,45,"And having found out from the centurion, he gave the geviyah"
41,15,46,"And having bought tachrichim linen cloths and having taken Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach down, he wrapped him in the tachrichim  and placed him in a kever which had been cut from rock, and he rolled a stone against the entrance of the kever."
41,15,47,"And Miryam of Magdala and Miryam the Imma of Yosi were observing [as eye-witnesses] of where Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach  had been laid."
41,16,1,"And when Shabbos had ended, Miryam Magdalene and Miryam Imma of Ya'akov, and Shlomit bought spices in order that they might go and anoint him."
41,16,2,"And at Shachrit on Yom Rishon, the first day of the shavu'a"
41,16,3,"And they were saying to themselves, Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the kever?"
41,16,4,"And having looked up, they observe that the stone, which was extremely large, had already been rolled aside!"
41,16,5,"And having entered into the kever, they saw a young man enrobed in white, sitting on the right side, and they were shocked with astonishment."
41,16,6,"But he says to them, Do not be alarmed.  You seek Yehoshua from Natzeret, who has been hanged on HaAitz. He has been made to stand up alive.  He is not here. Hinei!  The place where they laid him."
41,16,7,"But go tell his talmidim and Kefa that he goes before you into the Galil. There you will see him, just as he told you."
41,16,8,"And having gone out, they fled from the kever, and trembling and amazement seized them. And they told no one anything for they were afraid."
41,16,9,"And now after Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach arose early on Yom Rishon, he appeared rishonah to Miryam of Magdala, from whom he had cast out shiva shedim."
41,16,10,"She went out and announced to the ones who had been with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach while they were in avelut"
41,16,11,"And those who heard that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach lives and he was seen by her, refused to have emunah."
41,16,12,"And after these things, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach appeared in another demut to shenayim of them walking along into the country."
41,16,13,"And those having gone reported to the rest, but the rest did not have emunah either."
41,16,14,"But later Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach appeared to the Achad Asar themselves, reclining at tish, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach reproached them for their lack of emunah and the KESHI [stubbornness, hardness DEVARIM 9:27] of their levavot, because they had no bittachon in those who saw Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach after he had been made to stand up alive."
41,16,15,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Go into kol haOlam, and proclaim the Besuras HaGeulah to all HaBri'ah."
41,16,16,"The one having had emunah and having submitted to a tevilah of teshuva will be delivered in the Yeshu'at Eloheinu, but the one not having emunah will come under the gezar din"
41,16,17,"And these otot will accompany those that have emunah. Bishmi"
41,16,18,"And with their hands they will pick up nechashim"
41,16,19,"And then Adoneinu Yehoshua, after speaking to them, was taken up into Shomayim and V'YASHAV LIMIN HASHEM"
41,16,20,"And those having gone forth preached the Hachrazah"
42,1,1,"Vi-bahlt"
42,1,2,"just as these [masoret haShluchim] have been handed down to us by those who from HaReshit [of the Besuras HaGeulah] were edei re'iyah"
42,1,3,"I thought it expeditous also, having done an iyun, accurately and carefully being meayen in every source and and making a medakdeke investigation of every aspect from HaReshit, to write for you and to mesader"
42,1,4,"that you may have da'as of HaEmes regarding the Divrei Moshiach about which you took shiurim"
42,1,5,"At the time of Herod king of Yehudah, there was an a certain kohen by the name Zecharyah, who belonged to the Aviyah division.  His isha was of the banot Aharon and her name was Elisheva. [Divrey Hayamim Alef 24:10]"
42,1,6,"And they were both tzaddikim before Hashem, walking a derech tamim in all the mitzvot and chukim of the Torah of Adoneinu. [Bereshis 6:9; Devarim 5:33; Melachim Alef 9:4]"
42,1,7,"But they had no ben, because Elisheva was barren, and they were both advanced in their yamim."
42,1,8,"And it came to pass in the performance of his avodas kodesh sherut as a kohen before Hashem in the appointed order of his division, [Divrey Hayamim Alef 24:19; Divrey Hayamim Bais 8:14]"
42,1,9,"according to the minhag"
42,1,10,"And when the hour of the offering ot the ketoket came, all the multitude were davening outside. [Vayikra 16:17]"
42,1,11,"And there appeared to Zecharyah a malach Hashem, standing on the right side of the Mitzbe'ach of ketoret. [Shemot 30:1-10]"
42,1,12,"And, seeing the malach, Zecharyah was terrified, and pachad"
42,1,13,"But the malach said to him, Do not have pachad, Zecharyah. Your tefillah was heard and your isha, Elisheva, will bear a ben to you and you will call his shem Yochanan."
42,1,14,"And he will be a simcha to you and sasson, and there will be sasson rav at his huledet."
42,1,15,"And he will be gadol before Hashem, and he will not drink yayin or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Ruach Hakodesh from the womb of his em"
42,1,16,"and many of the Bnei Yisroel he will turn back in teshuva to Hashem Eloheihem."
42,1,17,"And he will go forth before Adonoi in the Ruach and Ko'ach of Eliyahu, VEHESHIV LEV AVOT AL BANIM"
42,1,18,"And Zecharyah said to the malach, Just how will I have da'as that this is so? For I am old and my isha is advanced in her yamim. [Bereshis 15:8; 17:17]"
42,1,19,"And in reply, the malach said to Zecharyah, I am Gavri'el, I stand before Hashem. And I was sent to speak to you and to announce these things to you. [Daniel 8:16; 9:21]"
42,1,20,"And --hinei!--, you will be ilem"
42,1,21,"And the people were expecting Zecharyah and they were bewildered at his delay in the Beis HaMikdash."
42,1,22,"And when he came out, he was ilem"
42,1,23,"And it came about as the yamim of his sherut as a kohen were fulfilled, he went to his bais."
42,1,24,"And after these yamim, Elisheva, his isha, became with child, and she kept herself in seclusion for chamesh chodashim, saying,"
42,1,25,"Hashem has done this for me.  In these yamim he looked with Chen V'Chesed on me to take away my reproach among bnei Adam. [Bereshis 30:23; Yeshayah 4:1]  THE HULEDET OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH FORETOLD"
42,1,26,"Now in the chodesh shishi the malach Gavri'el was sent from Hashem to a shtetl in the Galil called Natzeret,"
42,1,27,"to a betulah given in erusin"
42,1,28,"And when the malach approached her, he said, Shalom, favored one! Hashem is with you!"
42,1,29,"But she was greatly perplexed at the message, and kept pondering what sort of Shalom greeting this might be."
42,1,30,"And the malach said to her, Do not have pachad, Miryam, for you have found chen before Hashem. [Bereshis 6:8]"
42,1,31,"And--hinei--in your womb you will conceive and bear BEN [Yeshayah 7:14] and you will call SHMO Yehoshua. [Zecharyah 6:11-12]"

42,1,34,"But Miryam said to the malach, How will be this, vi-bahlt"
42,1,35,"And in reply, the malach said to her, The Ruach Hakodesh will come upon you and the gevurah of HaElyon will overshadow you. Therefore, also, the one being born will be called HaKadosh, Ben HaElohim."
42,1,36,"And--hinei-- Elisheva your korev"
42,1,37,"For nothing will be impossible with Hashem."
42,1,38,"And Miryam said, Hinei!--I am the shifcha"
42,1,39,"And in those yamim, Miryam got up and traveled into the hill country with haste to a shtetl of Yehudah."
42,1,40,"And she entered into the bais of Zecharyah and gave Shalom greetings to Elisheva."
42,1,41,"And it came about, when Elisheva heard the greeting of Shalom! of Miryam, the yeled leaped in Elisheva's womb, and Elisheva was filled with the Ruach Hakodesh."
42,1,42,"And Elisheva cried out with a kol gadol, and said, Berukhah at miNashim, and Baruch p'ri"
42,1,43,"And why has this happened to me that the Em Adoni should come to me?"
42,1,44,"For--hinei!--when the sound of your Shalom greeting came into my ears, the yeled leaped with simcha in my womb."
42,1,45,"And ashrey is the one having had emunah that there will be a fulfillment to the things having been spoken to Miryam by Hashem."

42,1,54,"Hashem helped his servant Yisroel, in zikaron of his rachamim,  [Tehillim 98:3]"
42,1,55,"just as Hashem spoke to Avoteinu, to Avraham Avinu and his Zera ad Olam."
42,1,56,"And Miryam remained with Elisheva about shalosha chodashim, and then Miryam returned to her bais. HULEDET AND YOUTH OF YOCHANAN OF THE TEVILAH OF TESHUVA"
42,1,57,"Now when the time of Elisheva to give birth was fulfilled,  she bore a ben."
42,1,58,"And Elisheva's shcheinim"
42,1,59,"And it came about on the yom hashemini they came for the Bris Milah of the yeled, and they were calling him by the name of  his abba, Zecharyah. [Bereshis 17:12]"
42,1,60,"And in reply, his em"
42,1,61,"And they said to her, There is no one from your kroivim who is called by this shem."
42,1,62,"And they began motioning to the yeled's abba to find out what shem he wanted to give him."
42,1,63,"And having asked for a luach, Zecharyah wrote, saying, Yochanan is his shem. And everyone was amazed."
42,1,64,"And Zecharyah's mouth was loosed at once and the lashon of him, and he began speaking, saying Baruch Hashem! [Yechezkel 24:27]"
42,1,65,"And upon all their shcheinim came much yirat Shomayim, and in the entire mountain country of Yehudah everyone was talking about these matters."
42,1,66,"All who heard these things pondered them in their levavot, saying, What then will this yeled become?  For, indeed, the yad Hashem was with him. [Bereshis 39:2]"
42,1,67,"And Zecharyah, his abba, was filled with the Ruach Hakodesh and brought forth a dvar nevu'ah, saying, [Yoel 2:28]"

42,4,43,"But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, It is necessary for me to preach the Malchut Hashem in the other shtetlach, because for this purpose I was sent."
42,4,44,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was preaching in the shuls of Yehudah."
42,5,1,"Now it came about that while the multitude was listening to the dvar Hashem and pressing in upon Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, he had been standing beside Lake Kinneret,"

42,5,17,"And it came about, on one of the yamim when he was teaching Torah, that the Perushim and Sofrim who had come from every shtetl of the Galil and Yehudah and Yerushalayim, were sitting down.  And the power of Hashem was with Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach to bring refu'ah."
42,5,18,"And-- hinei!--bnei Adam were carrying on a mat a man who had been paralyzed and they were seeking to carry in the paralytic and to place him before Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach."
42,5,19,"And not having found by what way they might carry him because of the multitude, and having gone up onto the roof, they let the man down with the mat through the tiles so that he was right in the center in front of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach."
42,5,20,"And having seen their emunah, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, Ish"
42,5,21,"And the Sofrim began to raise kashes"
42,5,22,"But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach having had da'as of their thoughts, said to them in reply, Why are you reasoning in your levavot?"
42,5,23,"Which is easier: to say, `Your chatta'im have been granted selicha,' or to say, `Get up and walk?'"
42,5,24,"But in order that you may have da'as that the Ben HaAdam has samchut"
42,5,25,"And at once the man arose in front of them, picked up the mat upon which he was lying, and departed to his bais, shouting, Baruch Hashem!"

42,5,29,"And Levi arranged a large seudah in his bais for Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, and there was a great number of mochesim and others who were with them, reclining at tish."
42,5,30,"And the Perushim and their Sofrim were murmuring against Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim, saying, Why with the mochesim and chote'im are you eating and drinking?"
42,5,31,"And in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, It is not the bari'im"
42,5,32,"I have not come to call the tzaddikim but chote'im to teshuva.     REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH GIVES HIS TALMIDIM MASHALIM ABOUT TZOMOT"

42,5,34,"But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, You are not able to make the Bnei haChuppah undergo tzomot while the Chosson is with them, are you?"
42,5,35,"But yamim will come when the Chosson is taken away from them; then, in those yamim, they will undergo tzomot.  A DERECH CHADASHA IN REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS NECESSARY FOR JUDAISM'S BRIT CHADASHA, EVEN THOUGH SOME ARE COMPLACENT AND CONTENT WITH WHAT IS NOT CHADASH"
42,5,36,"Now Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was telling also a mashal to them: No one tears a piece from a new garment, and sews it as a patch on old garment. Otherwise, both the new will be torn, and the patch from the new will not match the old."
42,5,37,"And no one puts yayin chadash into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the wineskins and it will be spilled and the wineskins will be destroyed."
42,5,38,"Rather, yayin chadash must be put into new wineskins."
42,5,39,"And no one having drunk the old desires the chadash, for he says, `The alter"
42,6,1,"And it came about on Shabbos that Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach is passing through grain fields, and his talmidim were plucking and eating the heads of grain and rubbing them in their hands. [Devarim 23:25]"
42,6,2,"Now some of the Perushim said, Why are you doing what is asur"
42,6,3,"And in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Have you not read what Dovid HaMelech did when he and those with him were  hungry, [Shmuel Alef 21:6]"
42,6,4,"how he entered into the Beit Hashem and took the Lechem HaPanim"
42,6,5,"And he was saying to them, The Ben HaAdam"
42,6,6,"And it came about on another Shabbos that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach entered into the shul and taught Torah. And there was a man there also whose right hand was withered."
42,6,7,"Now the Sofrim and Perushim were watching Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to see if he brings refu'ah on Shabbos, in order that they might find something to accuse him."
42,6,8,"But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach knew their thoughts, and said to the man having the withered hand, Rise and stand in the midst.  And the man got up and stood."
42,6,9,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, I ask you whether it is mutar"
42,6,10,"And having looked around at all of them, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to the man, Stretch out your hand.  And he did. And his hand was restored."
42,6,11,"But they"
42,6,12,"Now it came about in those yamim that Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach went forth to the mountain to daven, and he was spending the whole night b'tefillah to Hashem."
42,6,13,"And when boker came, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach summoned his talmidim, and having chosen from them Shneym Asar, whom he also named Shluchim:"
42,6,14,"Shimon, whom also he called Kefa, and Andrew his brother, and Ya'akov and Yochanan and Philippos and Bar-Talmai,"
42,6,15,"and Mattityahu and T'oma and Ya'akov Ben-Chalfai, and Shimon, the one being called the Zealot,"
42,6,16,"and Yehudah Ben-Ya'akov, and Yehudah from K'riot, who became the boged"
42,6,17,"And having come down with them, he stood on a level place, and a great multitude of his talmidim, and a great multitude of the Am Berit from all Yehudah and Yerushalayim and the coastal region of Tzor and Tzidon,"
42,6,18,"came to hear him and to receive refu'ah from their machalot, and the ones being troubled by ruchot hatemei'ot"
42,6,19,"and all were seeking to touch Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach because ko'ach"
42,6,20,"And lifting up his eyes to look at his talmidim, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, Ashrey are the the aniyim"
42,6,21,"Ashrey are the ones ra'evim"
42,6,22,"Ashrey are you when bnei Adam have sinas chinam for you and when they ostracize you and they reproach you and cast out your name as rah"
42,6,23,"Have simcha in that day and leap for chedvah"
42,6,24,"But oy to you, you ashirim, for you have already received in full your nechamah"
42,6,25,"Oy to you, the ones having been well fed now, for you will hunger. Oy, the ones laughing now, for you will mourn and weep. [Yeshayah 65:13; Mishle 14:13]"
42,6,26,"Woe when all bnei Adam speak well of you. For according to the same things were their Avot doing to the nevi'ei hasheker"
42,6,27,"But to you I say, to the ones listening, show ahavah to the your oyvim"
42,6,28,"Say a berakhah for the ones cursing you, daven for the ones mistreating you."
42,6,29,"To the one hitting you on the cheek, offer also the other, and from the one taking away your kaftan"
42,6,30,"To everyone asking you, give tzedakah; and from the one taking away your things, do not demand them back. [Devarim 15:7,8; Mishle 21:26]"
42,6,31,"And just as you want that bnei Adam may do to you, do to them similarly."
42,6,32,"And if you show ahavah to the ones showing ahavah to you, what kind of shvakh"
42,6,33,"For even if you do mitzvahs for the ones doing mitzvahs for you, what kind of shvakh to you is that?"
42,6,34,"And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what kind of shvakh to you is that?  Even chote'im lend to chote'im, that they receive in return the same amount."
42,6,35,"But show ahavah to your oyvim and do mitzvahs and Gemilut Chasadim, expecting nothing in return. And your sachar will be rav.  And you will be bnei Elyon"
42,6,36,"Be anashim of rachamanut"
42,6,37,"Judge not, lest you be judged. And do not condemn, and by no means may you be condemned. If you pardon with mechila"
42,6,38,"Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, having been pressed down and having been shaken, overflowing, will be put into your lap. For by what measure you measure it will be measured in return to you. [Tehillim 79:12; Yeshayah 65:6,7]"
42,6,39,"Now Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach told also a mashal to them.  Surely an ivver"
42,6,40,"A talmid is not above his moreh"
42,6,41,"And why do you see the speck in the eye of your ach, but the log in your own eye you do not notice?"
42,6,42,"How are you able to say to your ach, Ach, let me remove the speck in your eye,' while you yourself are not seeing the log in your own eye?  Tzevu'a, remove first the log from your eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck in the eye of your ach.  THE SOURCE OF LASHON HORAH: THE AITZ AND ITS P'RI"
42,6,43,"For there is no aitz tov producing p'ri rah, nor again an Aitz rah producing p'ri tov."
42,6,44,"For each aitz by its own p'ri will be known. For not from thorns do they gather figs nor from a thorn bush do they pick grapes."
42,6,45,"The ish tov from the good storehouse of the lev"
42,6,46,"And why do you call me, `Adoni,' and yet you do not do what I say?"
42,6,47,"Everyone coming to me and hearing my divrei Torah and putting them into practice, I will show you to whom he is likened."
42,6,48,"He is likened to the man building a bais who dug and went down deep and laid a yesod"
42,6,49,"Now the one having heard [Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's divrei Torah], and not having put them into practice, is like a man having built a bais upon the ground without a yesod, which the river struck against, and ofen ort"
42,7,1,"When he completed all his divrei torah in the oznei haAm"
42,7,2,"Of a certain eved of a centurion"
42,7,3,"And having had da'as of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, the centurion sent to him zekenim of the Yehudim, asking him to come and to give refu'ah to his eved."
42,7,4,"And when they had come to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, they were earnestly entreating him, saying, He is a worthy man that you grant this for him."
42,7,5,"For he is one of the hasidei ummot haOlam who loves our Jewish people and he built for us our shul."
42,7,6,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was starting out on his way with them; and when he was already not far from the bais, the centurion sent beloved re'im, saying to him, Adoni, do not trouble yourself further, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof;"
42,7,7,"Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to come to you.  But just say the dvar, and my eved will receive refu'ah. [Tehillim 107:20]"
42,7,8,"For I too am a man placed under the yad memshalah"
42,7,9,"And having heard these things, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was mispoyel"
42,7,10,"And when the ones having been sent returned to the bais, they found the eved being shalem b'guf"
42,7,11,"And it came about on the next day that Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach proceeded to a shtetl called Na'im, and his talmidim were traveling along with him as well as a great company of people."
42,7,12,"Now as Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach approached the sha'ar of the shtetl--hinei!--an ish met"
42,7,13,"And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu saw her, he had rachmonus over her and said, Do not weep."
42,7,14,"And having approached, he touched the aron met"
42,7,15,"And the niftar sat up and he began to speak, and Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach gave him to his em"
42,7,16,"And everyone was filled with yirat Shomayim and they were shouting, Baruch Hashem! And they were saying, A navi gadol is among us, and Hashem has visited his people."
42,7,17,"And this shema"
42,7,18,"And Yochanan's talmidim reported to him about all these things. And when he had summoned a certain two of his talmidim, Yochanan"
42,7,19,"sent them to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu, saying, Are you Hu HaBah [Moshiach] or should we be looking for another?"
42,7,20,"And when the men had come to him, they said, Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva sent us to you, saying, `Are you Hu HaBah [Moshiach] or should we be looking for another?'"
42,7,21,"At genoi"
42,7,22,"And in reply he said to them, Go and tell Yochanan what you have seen [as edey re'iyah]. IVRIM RO'IM, pisechim"
42,7,23,"And ashrey"
42,7,24,"And when the messengers of Yochanan had departed, he began to say to the multitudes about Yochanan, What did you go out bamidbar to see?  A reed shaken by the wind?"
42,7,25,"But what did you go out to see?  A man dressed in a dandy's soft clothing?--Hinei--the ones with glorious apparel are living in luxury as courtiers in the palaces."
42,7,26,"But what did you go out to see?  A navi?  Ken, I say to you, and one more than a navi."
42,7,27,"This one is he about whom it has been written,--HINENI SHOLEIACH MALAKHI (Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your derech in front of you [Malachi 3:1]"
42,7,28,"I say to you, among those born of isha there is no one greater than Yochanan, yet he who is least in the Malchut Hashem is greater than he."
42,7,29,"(And when kol haAm and the mochesim heard this, they acknowledged the Tzidkat Hashem, having been submitted to the tevilah of teshuva of Yochanan."
42,7,30,"But the Perushim and the Ba'alei HaTorah rejected the tachlis of Hashem for their lives, refusing the tevilah of teshuva of Yochanan.)"
42,7,31,"Therefore, to what will I compare the people of haDor hazeh"
42,7,32,"They are like yeladim sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another; and they say, `We played the chalil"
42,7,33,"For Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva has come not eating lechem nor drinking yayin, and you say, `He has a shed"
42,7,34,"The Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] has come eating and drinking, and you say, `Hinei!  A man who is a zolel"
42,7,35,"Yet chochmah is justified by all of her yeladim. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH IN THE BAIS OF SHIMON, ONE OF THE PERUSHIM; A CRITIQUE OF THE PERUSHIM VIS A VIS MOSHIACH; THE SOFEK"
42,7,36,"Now a certain one of the Perushim was requesting Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach at tish, and, he, having entered into the bais of the Parush, reclined to eat."
42,7,37,"And--hinei--an isha"
42,7,38,"She stood behind him, and then she began weeping at his feet, and with her tears she began to wash the feet of Rebbe Melech MaMoshiach and she was drying them with her hair, and she was kissing his feet and was anointing them with shemen bosem"
42,7,39,"But when the Parush who had invited Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach saw this, he said to himself, `If this one were a navi, he would have had da'as who and what sort of isha is touching him, because she is an isha chotet"
42,7,40,"And in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Shimon, I have something to say to you.  And he said, Speak, Rabbi."
42,7,41,"Two persons were debtors to a certain creditor; the one was owing a choiv"
42,7,42,"Not being able to repay, the creditor graciously forgave both debts.  Therefore which of them will have more ahavah for him?"
42,7,43,"In reply, Shimon said, I suppose the one whom the creditor forgave more. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Your judgment is in gantzen nachon"
42,7,44,"And having turned to the isha, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to Shimon, Do you see this isha?  I entered your bais, you did not give me mayim for my feet, but she has washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her rosh. [Bereshis 18:4; Shofetim 19:21]"
42,7,45,"You did not give me neshikah"
42,7,46,"With shemen my rosh you did not anoint. But she with shemen bosem"
42,7,47,"Oib azoi"
42,7,48,"And he said to her, Your averos have been granted selicha."
42,7,49,"And the ones reclining at tish with Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach began to say to themselves, Who is this who even grants selicha to averos?"
42,7,50,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to the isha, Your emunah has gained you Yeshu'at Eloheinu. L'chi L'shalom."
42,8,1,"And it came about afterwards that he was traveling through every shtetl and village preaching and proclaiming the Besuras HaGeulah of the Malchut Hashem; and the Shneym Asar were with Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach."
42,8,2,"And there were some nashim who had received refu'ah from ruchot ra'ot and machalot: Miryam"
42,8,3,"and Yochanah the wife of Kuza, the steward of Herod; Shoshanah, and many others who were giving maamadot"
42,8,4,"Now when a large multitude were coming together and the ones in every shtetl were making their derech to him, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke by way of a mashal:"
42,8,5,"The one sowing went out to sow his seed; and as he sows, some [seeds] fell beside the road; and it was trampled upon, and the birds of the air devoured it."
42,8,6,"And other seed fell upon the rock, and as soon as it grew up,  it dried up because it has no moisture."
42,8,7,"And other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it."
42,8,8,"And other seed fell in the adamah tovah and, having grown up, produced p'ri a hundredfold.  As Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said these things, he was calling out, The one having oznayim"
42,8,9,"Now Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim began questioning him as to what this mashal might be."
42,8,10,"And he said, To you it has been granted to have da'as of the razei Malchut Hashem"
42,8,11,"Now the mashal is this: The seed is the dvar Hashem."
42,8,12,"The ones beside the road are the ones having heard, then Hasatan comes and takes away the dvar Hashem from their levavot, so that they may not have emunah and come to Yeshua'at Eloheinu."
42,8,13,"Now the ones upon the rock are those who when they hear, with simcha they receive the dvar; and these have no shoresh"
42,8,14,"Now the seed which fell among thorns, these are the ones who have heard, and as they go on their derech, they are choked  by the da'agot"
42,8,15,"Now the one in the adamah tova, these are those who have heard the dvar Hashem with a lev tov and yeshar, and retain the dvar Hashem and bear p'ri with zitzfleisch"
42,8,16,"Now no one having lit a menorah covers it with a jar or places it under a bed; but he places the menorah on the shulchan, in order that the ones entering may see the ohr"
42,8,17,"For nothing is nistar"
42,8,18,"Therefore, be shomer how you listen, for whoever has, to  him shall more be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him.  WHO ARE THE TRUE ACHIM OF REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH?"
42,8,19,"And the em of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and his achim came to him, and they were not able to get to him because of the multitude."
42,8,20,"And it was announced to him, Your em"
42,8,21,"But in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, My em and my achim are these: the ones who are shomei dvar Hashem and also shomrei dvar Hashem.  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE BAAL HANES AND THE BAAL MOFET"
42,8,22,"Now it came about on one of those yamim that he and his talmidim embarked into a sirah"
42,8,23,"But as they were sailing, he fell asleep; and a driving storm of wind descended upon the lake, and they began to be swamped and began to be in pikuach nefesh"
42,8,24,"And they came and woke him up, saying, Adoneinu, Adoneinu, we are perishing!  And having been awakened, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach rebuked the wind and the rough waves, and the storm ceased.  And all became calm. [Tehillim 107:29]"
42,8,25,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Where is your emunah?  And they were fearful and amazed, saying to one another, Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the sea and they obey him? [Mishle 30:4]"
42,8,26,"And they sailed down to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite the Galil."
42,8,27,"And as Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach disembarked upon the shore, he was met from the town by a certain ish possessed by shedim; and the ish had not worn clothing for a long time and was not living in a bais but among the kevarim."
42,8,28,"And having seen Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach and having cried out, he fell down before him and said in a kol gadol, Mah li ul'chah, Yehoshua Ben El Elyon?"
42,8,29,"For Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach had been commanding the ruach hatemeiah"
42,8,30,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach questioned him, What is your name? And he said, Legion.  For many shedim had entered him."
42,8,31,"And the shedim were entreating Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, lest he might command them to depart into the abyss."
42,8,32,"Now there was there a herd of many chazirim feeding there on the mountain. And the shedim begged him that he might permit them to enter into those chazirim. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach permitted the shedim."
42,8,33,"And the shedim came out from the ish, and entered the chazirim, and the herd of chazirim rushed down the bank into the lake, and were drowned."
42,8,34,"And when the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the town and on the farms."
42,8,35,"And the people went out to see what had happened; and they came to him and found the ish from whom the shedim had gone out, and the ish was clothed and in his right mind, sitting at the feet of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach; and they were afraid."
42,8,36,"And the edat re'iyah"
42,8,37,"And all the multitude of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach to depart from them; because they were being filled with pachad gadol.  So he embarked into a sirah"
42,8,38,"And the ish from whom the shedim had gone out was begging Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach that he might accompany him. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach sent him away, saying, Return"
42,8,39,"to your bais and tell what great things Hashem has done for you.  And the man went away, preaching throughout the whole town, what great things Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach had done for him.         REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TZITZIT AND TAHARAT HAMISHPOCHAH: EMUNAH AS THE MEANS OF BRINGING NASHIM BACK FROM THE STATE OF ESCHATOLOGICAL NIDDAH"
42,8,40,"Now as Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach returns, the multitude gave him kabbalat panim"
42,8,41,"And--hinei!--there came an ish named Ya'ir and this one was one of the Roshei Beit HaKnesset, and he fell at the feet of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, pleading with him to come to his bais;"
42,8,42,"for he had a bat yachidah about shteym esreh shanah in age, and she was dying. But as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went, the multitudes were pressing around him,"
42,8,43,"and an isha having a flow of dahm for shteym esreh shanah, and who had spent all she had on rofim"
42,8,44,"approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach from behind, and she touched the tzitzit of his garment; and ofen ort"
42,8,45,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, Who is the one who touched me?  And while everyone was denying it, Kefa said, Adoneinu, the multitudes surround you and are pressing against you."
42,8,46,"But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, Someone did touch me, for I had da'as that ko'ach had gone out from me."
42,8,47,"And when the isha saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling and fell down before Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, and declared before the people the reason she touched him, and how ofen ort"
42,8,48,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to her, Biti"
42,8,49,"While he was still speaking, someone comes from the bais of one of the Roshei Beit HaKnesset [Ya'ir], saying, Your bat has died. No longer trouble the rabbi."
42,8,50,"But when Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach heard this, he answered him, Do not be afraid; only have emunah, and she will receive refu'ah."
42,8,51,"And having come to the bais, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach did not permit anyone to enter with him, except Kefa and Yochanan and Ya'akov, and the yaldah's abbah and em."
42,8,52,"And all were weeping and mourning for her; but Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, Stop weeping, for she has not died, but is sleeping."
42,8,53,"And they were making leitzonus of him, having had da'as that she was niftar."
42,8,54,"But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach took her by the hand and called out, saying, Yaldah, get up!"
42,8,55,"And her ruach returned, and she got up ofen ort"
42,8,56,"And her horim were amazed; but Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach instructed them to tell no one what had happened."
42,9,1,"And having called together the Shneym Asar, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach gave to them ko'ach and samchut over all the shedim and to give refu'ah to their illnesses."
42,9,2,"Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach sent them out as his maggidim to preach the Malchut Hashem and to administer refu'ah to the cholim"
42,9,3,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Take nothing for the journey, neither walking stick nor beggar's bag nor lechem nor kesef, nor a extra kaftan."
42,9,4,"And into whatever bais you may enter, remain there, and from there go out."
42,9,5,"And as many as do not receive you, going out from that shtetl, shake off the dust from your feet for an edut against them."
42,9,6,"And they departed and were itinerating throughout the shtetlach, preaching the Besuras HaGeulah and healing everywhere.  HEROD'S PECHADIM"
42,9,7,"Now Herod the Tetrarch heard all the things happening and he was perplexed because it was said by some that Yochanan had experienced the Techiyas HaMesim and come back,"
42,9,8,"by some also that Eliyahu Hanavi had appeared, but by others that some navi of the ancients arose."
42,9,9,"But Herod said, Yochanan I beheaded. Who then is this about whom I hear such things?  And he was seeking to see him. REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TISH AND THE MANNA FROM SHOMAYIM SERVED AT HIS FARBRENGEN"
42,9,10,"And having returned, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's Shluchim told him what things they did. And having taken them for a yechidus, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach withdrew to a shtetl being called Beth-Tzaidah."
42,9,11,"But the multitudes, having realized this, followed him.  And having given them a kabbalat panim"
42,9,12,"Now the day began to decline. And having approached, the Shneym Asar said to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, Send away the multitude, so that having gone into the surrounding shtetlach and farms, they may find lodging and may find provisions, for here we are in a desolate place."
42,9,13,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, You give them [something] to eat. But they said, There are not to us more than chamesh kikrot and dagim, shenayim, unless we go and buy for all this people okhel."
42,9,14,"For there were about chamesh elafim anashim. But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to his talmidim,  Have them recline [as at tish], chamishim in a group. [Tehillim 23:2]"
42,9,15,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim did so, and all reclined, [as at tish]."
42,9,16,"And having taken the chamesh kikrot and the shnei hadagim and having looked up to Shomayim, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said a berakhah over them and offered the betzi'at halechem and was giving to the talmidim to set before the multitude."
42,9,17,"And they ate and all were satisfied, and they picked up shirayim, shneym asar baskets full. THE ANI MA'AMIN OF THE CORRECT"
42,9,18,"And it came about while Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was davening alone, with only his talmidim with him, he questioned them, saying, Whom do the multitudes declare me to be?"
42,9,19,"And in reply they said, Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva, but others, Eliyahu Hanavi, and others, that a certain navi of the ancients has come back to life."
42,9,20,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, And you, whom do you declare me to be?  And in reply, Kefa said, The Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach of Hashem."
42,9,21,"And having warned them, he gave orders to tell no one this  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH BEGINS TO GIVE THE NEVU'AH"
42,9,22,"saying, It is necessary for the Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] to suffer much and to be rejected by the Ziknei HaAm"
42,9,23,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was saying to all, If anyone wishes to come after me"
42,9,24,"For whoever wishes to save his nefesh will lose it.  But whoever loses his nefesh on account of me"
42,9,25,"For what is the revach"
42,9,26,"For whoever is ashamed of me"
42,9,27,"But I say to you, Omein, there are some standing here who will by no means taste mavet until they see the Malchut Hashem. A PREVIEW OF THE BIAS HAREBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH"
42,9,28,"And it came to pass, about shemonah yamim after these divrei Moshiach, that when he had taken Kefa and Yochanan and Ya'akov, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach went up to the har"
42,9,29,"And it came about that while Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach davens, the appearance of his face became different and his kaftan and all his clothing became dazzling white."
42,9,30,"And--hinei--two men were conversing with Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, and these two men were Moshe Rabbeinu and Eliyahu HaNavi,"
42,9,31,"who appeared in kavod and were speaking of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's Exodus, which he was about to fulfill in Yerushalayim."
42,9,32,"But Kefa and the ones with him had been weighed down with sleep. And having awakened fully, they saw the kavod of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach and the two men, the ones having stood with Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach."
42,9,33,"And it came about, just as they departed from Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, Kefa said, Adoni, it is good for us to be here; let us make shalosh sukkot, one for you and one for Moshe Rabbeinu and one for Eliyahu HaNavi."
42,9,34,"And while Kefa was saying these things, an anan"
42,9,35,"And a Bat Kol came from the anan"
42,9,36,"When the Bat Kol became silent, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was found alone.  And they were silent, and reported to no one in those yamim anything of what they had seen.  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH HEALS THE BOCHUR POSSESSED BY SHEDIM"
42,9,37,"And it came about on the following day, when they had descended from the har"
42,9,38,"And--hinei--an ish from the multitude cried out saying, Rabbi, I beg you to look at beni, for to me he is a ben yachid,"
42,9,39,"and--hinei--a shed seizes him and suddenly lets out a shrai and throws the bochur into a convulsion with foam at the mouth and it mauls him and will scarcely depart from him."
42,9,40,"And I begged your talmidim that they might cast out the shed, and they were not able."
42,9,41,"And in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, O perverse dor"
42,9,42,"Even now as the bochur was approaching Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, the shed threw him down and convulsed him.  But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach rebuked the shed"
42,9,43,"And all were amazed at the gedulat Hashem. And while all were beholding the peledike way he was doing everything, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to his talmidim,"
42,9,44,"Let these divrei Hashem lodge in your ears: for the Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] is about to be delivered into the hands of bnei Adam."
42,9,45,"But they had no binah concerning this dvar of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, and it had been hidden from them in order that they might not understand it, and they were afraid to ask him about this dvar.  A SHEILAH FOR REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH: WHO ARE THE GEDOLIM?"
42,9,46,"Now an argument arose among the talmidim of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, as to who might be the Gadol among them."
42,9,47,"And Rebbe Melech Melech HaMoshiach, having perceived the thought of their levavot, took a yeled into his arms and stood him at his side."
42,9,48,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Whoever receives this yeled in ha-Shem of me"
42,9,49,"And in reply Yochanan said, Adoni, we saw someone casting out shedim b'Shem of you and we were trying to stop him, because he is not following as one of the anshei shlomeinu"
42,9,50,"But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Do not stop him. For whoever is not against you, is for you.  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH REBUKES THE SHLUCHIM YA'AKOV AND YOCHANAN FOR KA'AS; HIS TAFKID"
42,9,51,"And it came about that as the Yom of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's aliyah to Shomayim approaches, he set his face bedavka"
42,9,52,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach sent messengers ahead of him. And having gone, they entered into a village of Shomron in order to make arrangements for him."
42,9,53,"And the people of Shomron did not receive Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, because his face was set to go to Yerushalayim."
42,9,54,"And when Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim, Ya'akov and Yochanan, witnessed this, they said, Adoneinu, do you want that we should call aish to come down from Shomayim to consume them? [Melachim Bais 1:10,12]"
42,9,55,"And, having turned around, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach rebuked them."
42,9,56,"And they went to another village. IN THE OLAM HAZEH, THE REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH OF YISROEL REQUIRES TOTAL ALLEGIANCE, WITHOUT WHICH ONE CANNOT BE MEKABEL MOSHIACH"
42,9,57,"And as they were going on the road, a certain one said to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, I will follow you wherever you go."
42,9,58,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Foxes have dens and the OF HASHOMAYIM"
42,9,59,"And he said to another, Follow  me.  But the ish said, Adoni, allow me to go first and bury the Av of me."
42,9,60,"But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Leave the mesim"
42,9,61,"And another said also, I will follow you, Adoni. But first allow me to say l'hitraot to the ones in my bais. [Melachim Alef 19:20]"
42,9,62,"But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, No one having put his hand upon the plow yet looking back to the things behind is fit for the Malchut Hashem. [Bereshis 19:26]"
42,10,1,"And after these things, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu gave s'michah to shivim"
42,10,2,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, Indeed the Katzir is plentiful, but the po'alim of the Katzir are few; therefore, ask the Adon of the Katzir that he might send out po'alim into his Katzir."
42,10,3,"Go--hinei--I send you as kevasim"
42,10,4,"Do not carry a bag for kesef, nor a beggar's bag, nor sandals, and, along the derech, dispense with time-consuming `Shalom Alechem's.'"
42,10,5,"Into whatever bais you enter, first say, `Shalom to this bais.'"
42,10,6,"And if there is a ben hashalom there, your shalom will rest upon him. Otherwise, on you it will return. REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH ORDERS THAT HIS TALMIDIM NOT MOVE FROM BAIS TO BAIS SEEKING BETTER ACCOMMODATIONS AND TRYING TO MAKE A GOOD THING OUT OF THEIR VOCATION AS IF CHASSIDUS WERE A MEANS TO PROFITEER"
42,10,7,"Remain in the same bais eating and drinking the things with them. For worthy is the po'el"
42,10,8,"And into whichever shtetl you enter and they receive you, eat the okhel being set before you,"
42,10,9,"and administer refu'ah"
42,10,10,"And into whatever shtetl you enter and they do not receive you, having gone out into the rehkovot"
42,10,11,"Say, `Even the [the Goyishe unclean] dust from your shtetl, which clings to us, we shake off from our feet as an omen of din"
42,10,12,"I"
42,10,13,"Woe to you, Korazin, oy to you, Beit-Tzaidah, because if in Tzor and Tzidon had occurred the gevurot"
42,10,14,"But for Tzor and Tzidon it will be more bearable in the Yom HaDin than for you."
42,10,15,"And you, K'far-Nachum, surely not up to Shomayim will you be exalted? To Gehinnom you will descend!"
42,10,16,"The one listening to you, listens to me"
42,10,17,"And the Shivim returned with simcha, saying, Adoneinu, even the shedim submit to us b'Shem of you"
42,10,18,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, I was seeing Hasatan falling like lightning from Shomayim. [Yeshayah 14:12]"
42,10,19,"Hinei--! I have given to you the ko'ach and the samchut to walk on nechashim and akrabim, and on all the ko'ach of HaOyev [Hasatan], and nothing may by any means injure you. KATVENU B'SEFER HACHAYYIM LEMA'ANCHA ELOHIM CHAYYIM"
42,10,20,"But in this do not have a lev same'ach, on account of the ruchot"
42,10,21,"In the same hour Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was full of simcha by the Ruach Hakodesh and he said, Baruch Hashem, Avi, Adon HaShomayim v'haAretz, that you concealed these things from those with chochmah and saichel and you revealed them to yeladim, ken, Avi, for thus it was well-pleasing in your sight."
42,10,22,"Everything was handed over to me by Avi, and no one has da'as of HaBen except HaAv.  And no one has da'as of HaAv except HaBen, and whomever HaBen wishes to reveal [him]."
42,10,23,"And, having turned to the talmidim in a yechidus, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Ashrey [are] the eyes seeing what you see."
42,10,24,"For I say to you that many nevi'im and melakhim wanted to see what you see and they did not see them, and to hear what you hear and they did not hear them.  MASHAL OF THE SHOMRONI HATOV"
42,10,25,"And--hinei--a certain Talmid Chacham, a Ba'al Torah, stood up, testing Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, saying, Rabbi, what mitzva must I do to inherit Chayyei Olam?"
42,10,26,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, In the Torah what has been written? How do you read it?"
42,10,27,"And in reply the Ba'al Torah said, V'AHAVTA ES ADONOY ELOHECHA B'KHOL L'VAVCHA UVECHOL NAFSHECHA UVECHOL M'ODECHA [Devarim 6:4,5] and L'RE'ACHA KAMOCHA [Devarim 6:5; Vayikra 19:18]"
42,10,28,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Your answer is frum. Richtik"
42,10,29,"But because the Ba'al Torah wanted to justify himself, to be yitzdak im Hashem"
42,10,30,"In reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, A certain ish was coming down from Yerushalayim to Yericho, and he encountered shodedim"
42,10,31,"It so happened that a certain kohen was coming down by that derech, and, having seen him, he passed by on the other side. [Vayikra 21:1-3]"
42,10,32,"And likewise also a Levi happened upon the place, but when he came and saw him, he passed by on the other side."
42,10,33,"But a certain Shomroni, traveling along on the derech, came upon him; and when he saw him, he was filled with rachamim"
42,10,34,"And when this Shomroni approached, he bandaged the man's wounds, pouring shemen and yayin over them; and when he had placed him upon his own donkey, he brought the man to a malon"
42,10,35,"And on the next day he produced two denarii and gave them to the keeper of the malon and said, Take care of him, and whatever you spend additionally, I will take care of, when I return."
42,10,36,"Who of these shalosha seems to you to have become a re'a"
42,10,37,"And the Ba'al Torah answered, The one having shown the man rachamim. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Go and do likewise. REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH RECEIVED BY MARTA AND MIRYAM AT BEIT-ANYAH"
42,10,38,"And while they were on the derech, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach entered into certain shtetl.  And a certain isha by the name Marta received him."
42,10,39,"And this isha had an achot"
42,10,40,"But Marta was distracted with much avodas. And having stood by, she said, Adoneinu, is it of no concern to you that my achot has left me alone to serve? Speak, then, to her that she may help me."
42,10,41,"And in reply Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu said to her, Marta, Marta, you are anxious and worried about many things,"
42,10,42,"but one is necessary.  For Miryam chose haTov which will not be taken away from her."
42,11,1,"And it came about while Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was in a certain place davening that, when he concluded, a certain one of his talmidim said to him, Adoneinu, teach us to daven, just as also Yochanan taught his talmidim."
42,11,2,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, When you daven, say, `Avinu, yitkadash shmecha`"
42,11,3,"`Es lechem chukeinu ten lanu yom yom'"
42,11,4,"`u-s'lach lanu al chatta'einu'"
42,11,5,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Who among you will have a chaver and will come to him at chatzot halailah"
42,11,6,"`because a chaver of mine has come from a journey to me and I have nothing to set before him';"
42,11,7,"and from inside he shall reply, saying, `Do not bother me; the delet has already been shut, and my yeladim and I are already in bed; I cannot get up and give to you anything.'"
42,11,8,"I say to you, even if he will not get up and give him anything, because he is his chaver, at least because of his persistence he will get up and give to him as much as he needs."
42,11,9,"And I tell you, ask, and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you."
42,11,10,"For everyone asking receives; and he who is seeking, finds; and to the one knocking, it shall be opened."
42,11,11,"And what av among you is there who will ask his ben for a dag"
42,11,12,"Or if the ben will ask for an beytzah"
42,11,13,"If, therefore, you, though you are ra'im, have da'as of how to give matanot tovot to your yeladim, how much more will HaAv sh'baShomayim give the Ruach Hakodesh to the ones asking him. CHILLUL HASHEM AGAINST REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH"
42,11,14,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was casting out a shed from a ish illem"
42,11,15,"But some of them said, He casts out the shedim by Ba'al-zibbul Sar HaShedim."
42,11,16,"And others, to test him, were demanding of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach an ot"
42,11,17,"But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, having had da'as of their makhshavot"
42,11,18,"And if Hasatan also was divided against himself, how shall Hasatan's Malchut stand?  Because you say by Ba'al-zibbul I cast out shedim."
42,11,19,"But if I by Ba'al-zibbul cast out the shedim, by whom do your banim cast them out?  Consequently, they shall be your shofetim"
42,11,20,"But, if I, by the finger of Hashem, cast out the shedim, then the Malchut Hashem has come upon you. [Shemot 8:19]"
42,11,21,"When a Gibbor"
42,11,22,"but when someone stronger than him overpowers him, he takes away from him all his shiryon kaskasim"
42,11,23,"The one who is not with me is against me"
42,11,24,"When the ruach hatameh goes out from the ish, it goes through waterless places seeking a menukhah"
42,11,25,"And when it comes, it finds the bais having been swept and put beseder"
42,11,26,"Then it goes and takes another sheva shedim more ra'ot"
42,11,27,"And it came about while Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach says these things, a certain isha in the multitude, having lifted up her voice, said to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, Ashrey is the womb having carried you and the breasts that nursed you."
42,11,28,"But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, Aderaba"
42,11,29,"And as the multitudes are gathering even more, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach began to say, HaDor HaZeh"
42,11,30,"For just as Yonah became to the Ninevites an ot, so also the Ben HaAdam will be an ot to HaDor HaZeh."
42,11,31,"The Queen of the South will be made to stand up alive at the [Yom HaDin] judgment with the men of HaDor HaZeh and she will declare a gezar din"
42,11,32,"Men of Nineveh will stand up at the mishpat"
42,11,33,"No one having lit a menorah puts it in a hidden place, nor under the measuring bucket, but on the shulchan, in order that the ones entering may see the ohr.  THE FATAL MISTAKE OF RABBINIC JUDAISM WITHOUT HITKHADESHUT"
42,11,34,"The menorah of the guf"
42,11,35,"See to it, then, that the ohr in you is not choshech"
42,11,36,"If therefore, your whole guf"
42,11,37,"Now while Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach spoke, a Parush asks him that he might have betzi'at halechem"
42,11,38,"And the Parush, having seen this, was amazed that Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach did not first do n'tilat yadayim before the meal."
42,11,39,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu said to him, Now you Perushim wash the outside of the kos and the dish you clean, but the inside of you is full of gazel"
42,11,40,"Goylomim! Did not the one having made the outside also make the inside?"
42,11,41,"But as far as what is inside, give tzedakah, and --hinei-- everything is tahor"
42,11,42,"But oy to you, Perushim, because you give as ma'aser"
42,11,43,"Oy to you Parush! Because your ahavah is for the moshavot harishonim in the shuls and the sh'elat shalom greetings in the market places."
42,11,44,"Woe to you, because you are like the unmarked kevarim"
42,11,45,"And, in reply, one of the Ba'alei Torah says to him, Rabbi, by saying these things you insult us also."
42,11,46,"But Rebbe, Melech, HaMoshiach said, Also woe to you Ba'alei Torah, because you burden men with [halachic] loads difficult to carry, and you yourselves with so much as one of your fingers do not touch the loads [with a heter]."
42,11,47,"Woe to you, because you build the matsevot"
42,11,48,"Therefore, you are edim"
42,11,49,"Therefore, also the Chochmah of Hashem said, `I will send to them Nevi'im and Shluchim, some of whom they will kill and persecute, [Lu.20:9-19]"
42,11,50,"`that the Dahm of all the Nevi'im that has been poured out from the hivvased haOlam may be charged to HaDor HaZeh,"
42,11,51,"`from the blood of Hevel to the blood of Zecharyah who was killed al Kiddush ha-Shem between the Mitzbe'ach and the Beis Hashem;' ken, I tell you, it will be required from HaDor HaZeh. [Bereshis 4:8; Divrey Hayamim Bais 24:20,21]"
42,11,52,"Woe to you Ba'alei Torah, because you took the mafte'ach of da'as; you yourselves did not enter in; and the ones entering in you hindered."
42,11,53,"And when he went from there, the Sofrim and the Perushim began to be terribly hostile and to hock"
42,11,54,"plotting to catch him in something from his mouth."
42,12,1,"Meanwhile, when the multitudes by the thousands assembled, to the point of trampling one another, Rebbe, Melech, HaMoshiach said this in a yechidus first to his talmidim, Be shomer regarding the Se'or of the Perushim, which is their tzeviut"
42,12,2,"And nothing that men hide in a cover up is concealed which will not be revealed, and nothing held in secret which will not be laid bare."
42,12,3,"So then, what things you said in the choshech, will be heard in the ohr; and what you whispered in the ear in the secret chadarim"
42,12,4,"I say to you, my chaverim, do not have pachad of the killers of the guf"
42,12,5,"But I will show you Someone of whom you should have yir'ah; fear the one who after killing the body has the samchut to throw into Gehinnom. Ken, I say to you, have yir'ah of this One."
42,12,6,"Are not chamesh sparrows sold for two assarion? And not even one of them has been overlooked in the eynayim of Hashem."
42,12,7,"But even the hairs of your rosh have all been counted.  Never fear. You are of more worth than many sparrows."
42,12,8,"And I say to you, whoever will declare publicly the Ani Ma'amin of me [as Moshiach] before bnei Adam, the Ben HaAdam [Moshiach, Daniel 7:13-14] will make hoda'ah"

42,12,14,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Ben Adam, who appointed me a shofet or an arbitrator over you?"
42,12,15,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Take care and be shomer against all chamdanut, because the Chayyei HaAdam does not consist in the abundance of his possessions. [Iyov 20:20; 31:24; Tehillim 62:10]"
42,12,16,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke a mashal to them saying, An aza"
42,12,17,"And he was thinking to himself saying, `What should I do? Because I do not have a place where I will store my crops.'"
42,12,18,"And he said, `This I will do, I will tear down my asim"

42,12,22,"And Rebbe, Melech, HaMoshiach said to his talmidim, Therefore, I say to you: do not have a LEV ROGEZ"
42,12,23,"For the neshamah is more than okhel and the guf"
42,12,24,"Consider the ravens! They do not sow nor reap, they have no storeroom or asam"
42,12,25,"And can any of you by means of a LEV ROGEZ add one cubit to your span of Chayyim?"
42,12,26,"If then you are not able to do even a small thing, why have a LEV ROGEZ about the rest?"
42,12,27,"Consider the lilies! How they grow! A lily does not labor nor spin. But I say to you, not even Shlomo HaMelech in all his kavod was arrayed like one of these. [Melachim Alef 10:4-7]"

42,12,40,"So you be shomer, for the Ben HaAdam"
42,12,41,"And Kefa said, Adoneinu, are you speaking this mashal for us or for all?"
42,12,42,"And HaAdon said, Who then is the sochen hane'eman and navon"
42,12,43,"Ashrey is that eved, whom, having come, his Adon will find doing thus."
42,12,44,"Omein, I say to you, that he will appoint him over all that he has."
42,12,45,"But if that eved says in his lev, `Adoni delays to come to me,' and he begins to beat ha'avadim and hashefakhot, and to gluttonize and get down in his schnapps,"
42,12,46,"HaAdon of that eved will come on a day which he does not expect and at an hour of which he does not have da'as, and will cut him in pieces and assign him the Apikoros' portion with the unbelievers."
42,12,47,"That eved, who had da'as of the ratzon of his Adon and did not get prepared or do according to his ratzon, will be beaten with klap"
42,12,48,"But the one not having had da'as, but having done things worthy of a klap, will receive but a few. But to everyone to whom much was given, much will be required from him, and to whom was entrusted much, even more achraius"
42,12,49,"I came to throw Aish on the earth, and how I wish it was already kindled!"
42,12,50,"And I have a tevilah I have to be submerged with, and how I am distressed until it is completed."
42,12,51,"Do you think that I came to bring Shalom on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather machaloket"
42,12,52,"For there will be from now chamesh in one bais having been divided, shalosha against shenayim and shenayim against shalosha,"
42,12,53,"`AV will be divided against BEN and BEN against AV, EM"
42,12,54,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying also to the multitudes, When you see the anan rising over the ma'arav"
42,12,55,"And when there is a south wind blowing, you say `It will be kham"
42,12,56,"Tzevu'im! You have da'as how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky; how is it, then, that you do not have da'as of how to interpret HaZman HaZeh?"
42,12,57,"And why also for yourselves do you not judge what is yashar"
42,12,58,"For as you go with your ish riv"
42,12,59,"I say to you, by no means may you come out, until even the last peruta"
42,13,1,"Now on the same occasion there were some present reporting to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach about the men of the Galil whose blood Pilate mixed with their zevakhim"
42,13,2,"And, in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Do you think that these men of the Galil were greater chote'im than all others of the Galil, because they suffered this shud"
42,13,3,"Lo, I say, but unless you make teshuva, you will all likewise perish."
42,13,4,"Or do you think that those shmonah asar"
42,13,5,"Lo, I tell you, but unless you make teshuva, you will all likewise perish."
42,13,6,"And he was speaking this mashal.  A certain man had an aitz te'enah"
42,13,7,"So he said to the keeper of the kerem, `Hinei--shalosh shanim I come seeking p'ri on this aitz te'enah"
42,13,8,"But in reply he says to him, `Adoni, leave it also this year, until I may dig around it and may throw fertilizer on it,"
42,13,9,"`And if indeed it produces p'ri in the future; otherwise, you will cut down it.'  REFU'AH ON SHABBOS"
42,13,10,"Now Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was teaching in one of the shuls on Shabbos."
42,13,11,"And--hinei--an isha which had a ruach hamachla shmonah asar"
42,13,12,"And when he saw her, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach called out to her and said, Isha, you have been set free from your machla"
42,13,13,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach placed his hands upon her. And ofen ort"
42,13,14,"And in reply the Rosh of the Beit HaKnesset, being indignant that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had healed on Shabbos, was saying to the multitude, There are sheshet yamim"
42,13,15,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu answered him and said, Tzevu'im!  Does not each of you on Shabbos untie his ox or his donkey from the evus and lead it away to water him?"
42,13,16,"But ought not this isha, a bat Avraham Avinu as she is, whom Hasatan has bound--hinei, nebbach--these shmonah asar"
42,13,17,"And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said these things, all his mitnaggedim"
42,13,18,"Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, What is the Malchut Hashem like?  And to what shall I make a tzushtel"
42,13,19,"It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and threw into his own garden, and it grew and became an aitz, and the OF HASHOMAYIM nested in its branches."
42,13,20,"And again Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, To what shall I compare the Malchut Hashem?"
42,13,21,"It is like se'or"
42,13,22,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was itinerating throughout the shtetlach"
42,13,23,"And someone said to him, Adoni, are there only a few coming to Yeshu'at Eloheinu? And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them,"
42,13,24,"Strive to enter through the delet hatzarut"
42,13,25,"After the Ba'al Bayit gets us and shuts the delet, and you begin to stand outside and to knock on the delet, saying, `Adoneinu, open up for us!' and in reply, he will say to you, `I do not have da'as of you, of from where you are from.'"
42,13,26,"Then you will begin to say, `We ate and drank in your presence, and in our rehkovot you taught.'"
42,13,27,"And he will speak, saying to you, `I do not know you, from where you are from. Go away from me, kol po'alei resha!'"
42,13,28,"There will be weeping and gnashing of the teeth, when you will see Avraham Avinu and Yitzchak and Ya'akov and all the Nevi'im in the Malchut Hashem, but yourselves being thrown out."
42,13,29,"And they will come from mizrach and ma'arav and from tzafon and darom and they will bimesibba recline at tish in the Malchut Hashem."
42,13,30,"And--hinei--there are some acharonim who will be rishonim and there are some rishonim who will be acharonim."
42,13,31,"In the same hour some Perushim approached Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying to him, Depart and go from here, because Herod wants to kill you."
42,13,32,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Go and tell that fox, `Hinei-- behold I cast out shedim and I accomplish refu'ot"
42,13,33,"Nevertheless, it is necessary for me to travel on hayom and makhar and the yom following, because it cannot be that a navi should perish outside Yerushalayim."
42,13,34,"O Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, she who kills the Nevi'im and stones the ones sent to her!  How often I wanted to gather your yeladim just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing!"
42,13,35,"Hinei-- your Beis is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you shall by no means see me until the zman comes when you say, BARUCH HABAH B'SHEM ADONAI [Yirmeyah 12:17; Tehillim 118:26]"
42,14,1,"And it came to pass when he went into a bais of a certain one of the Rashei HaPerushim on Shabbos for betzi'at halechem, and they were watching him closely."
42,14,2,"And--hinei--there in front of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was a certain ish suffering from dropsy."
42,14,3,"And in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach spoke to the Ba'alei Torah and Perushim, saying, Is it mutar"
42,14,4,"But they kept silent.  And having taken hold of him, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach granted him refu'ah and sent him away."
42,14,5,"And to them Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Who of you having a ben or an ox fall into a well, and will not ofen ort"
42,14,6,"And they were not able to make a reply against this."
42,14,7,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began speaking a mashal to the seudah invitees, when he noticed how they had been picking out the rashei hamoshavot"
42,14,8,"When you are invited by someone to a Chassuna, you should not recline at tish in the rashei hamoshavot"
42,14,9,"and he who invited you both shall come and say to you, `Give place to this one,' and then in bushah you proceed to occupy the moshav shafel"
42,14,10,"But when you are invited, go and recline at tish in the moshav shafel, so that when the one who has invited you comes,  he may say to you, Chaver, move up to a higher place; then you will have kavod in the sight of all who are with you at the tish."
42,14,11,"For everyone exalting himself shall be humbled, and the one humbling himself shall be exalted."
42,14,12,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was speaking also to the one who him invited him, When you prepare a seudah or a Melave Malkah, do not invite your chaverim or your achim or your krovey mishpokhot"
42,14,13,"But when you prepare a seudah, invite the aniyim, the ba'alei hamum, the pisechim, the ivrim,"
42,14,14,"and birkat Shomayim will befall you, because they do not have the means to repay you; for you will be repaid in the Yom Tekumat haTzadikkim."
42,14,15,"And when a certain one of those reclining at tish with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach heard these things, he said to him, Ashrey is he who will eat lechem in the Malchut Hashem!  [Yeshayah 25:6]"
42,14,16,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, A certain man was preparing a big seudah, and he invited many;"
42,14,17,"And at the dinner hour, he sent his eved to say to the seudah invitees, `Come, because everything is ready now.'"
42,14,18,"But each began to come up with a ptur"
42,14,19,"And another said, `I have bought chamesh pair of oxen, and I am going to try them out.  Please accept my ptur"
42,14,20,"And another said, `I took a wife and therefore I am not able to come.'"
42,14,21,"And the eved returned and reported this to his Adon.  Then the Ba'al Bayit became angry and said to his eved, `Go out quickly into the rehkovot and lanes of the shtetl and bring in here the aniyim and the ba'alei hamum, and the ivrim and the pisechim.'"
42,14,22,"And the eved said, `Adoni, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.'"
42,14,23,"And the Adon said to the eved, `Go out to the rehkovot and along the boundaries and urge them to come in, in order that my Beis may be filled."
42,14,24,"`For I say to you that no one of those bnei Adam who were invited will taste my seudah.'    REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TALMIDIM MUST PUT MOSHIACH ABOVE ALL"
42,14,25,"And large multitudes were accompanying him, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach turned and said to them,"
42,14,26,"If someone comes to me, and does not hate his own abba and em"
42,14,27,"Whoever does not carry his own aitz [of self-denial] and come after me [Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach] is not able to be my talmid."
42,14,28,"For who among you, wanting to build a migdal"
42,14,29,"Otherwise, having laid his yesod"
42,14,30,"saying, `This man began to build and was not able to finish.'"
42,14,31,"Or what melech, going out to engage another melech in milkhamah"
42,14,32,"Or else, while the other is noch"
42,14,33,"So, then, none of you can become my talmid if you do not renounce all you possess."
42,14,34,"Therefore, melach"
42,14,35,"It is useless either for adamah or for the dung hill; they throw it away.  The one who has ears to hear, shema!"
42,15,1,"Now all the mochesim and the chote'im were coming near Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to listen to him."
42,15,2,"And both the Perushim and the Sofrim were grumbling, saying, This one welcomes chote'im and eats at tish with them."
42,15,3,"And he told them this mashal, saying,"
42,15,4,"What man of you, if he has me'ah kevasim"
42,15,5,"And when it has found it, he puts it on his shoulders with lev same'ach. [Tehillim 23;119; Yirmeyah 31:10; Yechezkel 34:11-16]"
42,15,6,"And when he returns to his bais, he calls together his chaverim and his sh'khenim, saying to them, Have simcha with me, because I have found my keves"
42,15,7,"I say to you that in the same way there will be more simcha in Shomayim over one chot'eh who becomes a ba'al teshuva than over tishim v'tish'ah tzaddikim who have no need of teshuvah."
42,15,8,"Or what isha having asaret"
42,15,9,"And having found it, she calls together chaverim and sh'khenim saying, `Have simcha with me, for I have found the drachma which I lost.'"
42,15,10,"In the same way, I say to you, there is simcha in the presence of the malachim Hashem over one chot'eh who becomes a ba'al teshuva.  THE MASHAL OF THE BEN HAOVED"
42,15,11,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, A certain ben Adam had shnei banim."
42,15,12,"And the younger of them said to his abba, `Avi, give to me the share of the estate that falls to me.' And he distributed his property to them."
42,15,13,"And not many yamim later, having gathered together everything, the younger ben went on a journey to a far away country, and there he squandered his ashires with loose living."
42,15,14,"And when he had spent everything, there came a severe ra'av"
42,15,15,"And he went and became associated with one of the citizens of that aretz, and he sent him into his fields to feed chazirim, [Vayikra 11:7]"
42,15,16,"and he was longing to fill his stomach with the pods which the chazirim were eating, and no one was giving anything to him."
42,15,17,"When he came to his senses, his saichel told him, How many of my abba's hired men have more than enough okhel and I am perishing here with hunger."
42,15,18,"I will get up and go to my abba, and I will say, `Avi, I sinned against Shomayim and in your sight. [Vayikra 26:40]"
42,15,19,"`I am no longer worthy to be called your ben. Make me as one of your hired men.'"
42,15,20,"And when he arose he came home to his own abba. And while he was still a long way off, his abba saw him, and was filled with rachamim and tears and fell upon his neck and kissed him. [Bereshis 45:14]"
42,15,21,"And his ben said to him, `Avi, I sinned against Shomayim and in your sight, no longer am I worthy to be called your ben.' [Tehillim 51:4]"
42,15,22,"But his abba said to his avadim, `Hizdarez"
42,15,23,"`and bring the fattened calf, and slaughter it, and let us eat and have a simcha,"
42,15,24,"`Because this ben of mine was dead and now he has returned L'Chayyim!  He had been lost and now he is found.' And they began to make a simcha."
42,15,25,"But the abba's alterer ben was in the sadeh. And as he was coming, he drew near to the bais, and he heard the zemirot, and the sound of the klezmer"
42,15,26,"And having summoned one of the avadim, the alterer ben was inquiring what these things might be."
42,15,27,"And the eved said to him, `Your ach is present, and your abba sacrificed the fattened calf, because your abba received him back bari v'shalem"
42,15,28,"And the alterer ben was angry, and he did not want to enter.  But his abba came out and was pleading with him."
42,15,29,"But in reply the alterer ben said to his abba, `Hinei, so many years I serve you and never a mitzvah of you I disobeyed, and never for me did you give even a young goat that with my chaverim I might have a simcha."
42,15,30,"`But when this ben of yours, the one having devoured your property with zonot, came, you sacrificed for him the fattened calf.' [Mishle 29:3]"
42,15,31,"And the abba said to him, `Beni, you are always with me, and everything which is mine is yours."
42,15,32,"`But now it was necessary for us to have lev samei'ach and make a simcha, because the ach of you was dead and he has returned l'Chayyim!  He has been lost and now is found.' [Malachi 3:17]"
42,16,1,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying also to the talmidim, A certain ish ashir"
42,16,2,"And having called him, he said to him, `What is this I hear about you?  Render a cheshbon"
42,16,3,"And the sochen said to himself, `What may I do, because  my Adon takes away the pekuddat from me?  I am not strong enough to dig, I am ashamed to beg."
42,16,4,"`Oh! I have da'as of what I may do, that when I am removed from the work of the sochen, they may receive me into their batim"
42,16,5,"And having summoned his Adon's debtors one by one, he was saying to the first, `How much do you owe Adoni?'"
42,16,6,"And he said, `One hundred jugs of olive oil.'  And the sochen said to him, `Take your bill, sit down, quickly write fifty.'"
42,16,7,"Then to another he said,`And you, how much do you owe?'  And he said, `One hundred containers of wheat.' He says to him, `Take your bill and write eighty.'"
42,16,8,"And the Ba'al Bayit praised the unrighteous sochen because he acted with chochmah.  Because the Bnei HaOlam HaZeh have more saichel in dealing with their own generation than the Bnei HaOhr. [Tehillim 17:14; 18:26]"
42,16,9,"And I say to you, use mammon to make for yourselves chaverim, so that when it fails, they may welcome you into the mishkenot olam."
42,16,10,"The one ne'eman"
42,16,11,"If, then, you were not ne'eman with unrighteous mammon, who will entrust you with true riches?"
42,16,12,"And if you were not ne'eman with that which belongs to another, who will give you what is your own?"
42,16,13,"No eved is able to serve two adonim; for either he will have sin'ah"
42,16,14,"And the Perushim, who were ohavei kesef"
42,16,15,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, You are the ones who in the sight of bnei Adam credit yourself as yitzdak im Hashem, but Hashem has da'as of your levavot.  Because the thing highly esteemed among bnei Adam is a to'eva"
42,16,16,"The Torah and the Nevi'im were proclaimed until Yochanan; vi-bahlt"
42,16,17,"But it is easier for HaShomayim and HaAretz to pass away than for one tag"
42,16,18,"Anyone giving the get to his isha and taking another wife  commits ni'uf"
42,16,19,"Now there was a certain ish ashir"
42,16,20,"And there was a certain evyon ish"
42,16,21,"And the kaptzan El'azar longed to fill his stomach with what fell from the rich man's tish. But even the kelevim were coming and licking the kaptzan's sores."
42,16,22,"And it came to pass that El'azar died, and he was carried away by the malachim to the kheyk"
42,16,23,"And lifting up his eynayim in She'ol, where he was in the torments of agony, he sees Avraham Avinu off in the distance and El'azar at his kheyk."
42,16,24,"And he called, `Avraham Avinu!  Chaneni na and send El'azar that he may dip the tip of his finger into the mayim and cool my leshon, because I am in torment in this moked"
42,16,25,"But Avraham Avinu said, `Beni, have zikaron that you received your tov in the chayyim of you, and El'azar likewise the ra'ah.  But now he is given nechamah"
42,16,26,"`And, in addition to all these things, there has been fixed between us and you a tehom gedolah"
42,16,27,"And he said, `I ask you then, Avraham Avinu, that you may send El'azar to the bais of Avi,"
42,16,28,"`for I have chamesh achim!--that he may warn them, lest also they may come to this place of yisurim"
42,16,29,"But Avraham Avinu says, `They have Moshe Rabbeinu and the Nevi'im.  Let them listen to them.'"
42,16,30,"But he said, `Lo, Avraham Avinu, but if someone from the Mesim should go to them, they will make teshuva."
42,16,31,"But Avraham said to him, `If Moshe Rabbeinu and the Nevi'im they do not listen to, neither if someone from the Mesim should come back again will they be persuaded.'"
42,17,1,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to his talmidim, It is impossible for the nissayon to sin not to come, but oy through whom it comes."
42,17,2,"It is better for him if a millstone is hung around his neck  and he had been thrown into the sea than that he should cause a michshol"
42,17,3,"Pay attention to yourselves. If your ach sins and you rebuke him, and if he makes teshuva,  grant him selicha"
42,17,4,"And if shevah pe'amim"
42,17,5,"And the Shluchim said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu, Increase our emunah."
42,17,6,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu said, If you have emunah like a mustard seed, you would have said to this mulberry aitz, be uprooted and be planted in the sea, and it would have given you mishma'at."
42,17,7,"But who among you, having an eved plowing or tending kevesim, when he comes in from the sadeh, will say to him, `Here, come ofen ort"
42,17,8,"Rather, would he not say, `Prepare something that I may have okhel; gird up your tunic and serve me until I am satisfied, and after that, you may have okhel'?"
42,17,9,"There is no obligatory effusive todah, when the eved only did his chiyuv"
42,17,10,"So also you, when you do all these things which are given you as mitzvot, say, `We are useless avadim, we only did our duty.'  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND PESACH IN YERUSHALAYIM; ONLY ONE OF THE ANASHIM METZORA'IM IS MAKIR OF MOSHIACH; THE MONUMENTAL INGRATITUDE OF THE AM YISROEL FOR THEIR REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH; BE MAKIR DO NOT LOOK FOR ANOTHER!"
42,17,11,"And it came about while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach goes to Yerushalayim, he was traveling through the middle of Shomron and the Galil."
42,17,12,"And entering into a certain shtetl, some anashim metzora'im"
42,17,13,"they shouted, saying, `Yehoshua, Moreinu, chaneinu!'"
42,17,14,"And having seen this, he said to them, `Go and show yourselves to the kohanim.' And it came about while they were going away that they were made metoharim"
42,17,15,"And one of them, having seen that he had received refu'ah, returned with a kol gadol, saying Baruch Hashem!"
42,17,16,"And he fell on his face at the feet of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach giving todot.  And he was a Shomroni"
42,17,17,"And in reply Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, Were there not asarah"
42,17,18,"Was none of them found to return and to give kavod"
42,17,19,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Get up and go. Your emunah"
42,17,20,"Now having been asked by the Perushim, When comes the Malchut Hashem? he replied, The Malchut Hashem is not coming with things observable,"
42,17,21,"nor will they say `Hinei, here it is,' or `There it is,' for hinei, the Malchut Hashem is within you."
42,17,22,"And he said to the talmidim, Yamim are coming when you will long to see one of the yamim of the Ben HaAdam"
42,17,23,"They will say to you, `Hinei, there it is!' or, `Hinei, here it is!'  Do not go out after them nor pursue them."
42,17,24,"For as the lightning flashing out of one part under Shomayim lights up the other part under Shomayim, thus will be the Ben HaAdam"
42,17,25,"But b'rishonah it is necessary for him to suffer many things and to be rejected by HaDor HaZeh."
42,17,26,"And just as it was in the yamim of Noach, thus will it be also in the yamim of the Ben HaAdam"
42,17,27,"They were eating, drinking, marrying, and being given in marriage, until the yom when Noach entered into the Tevah"
42,17,28,"Likewise, just as it was in the yamim of Lot. They were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, and building. [Bereshis 19:1-28]"
42,17,29,"But on the yom when Lot went out from S'dom, from Shomayim it rained down aish and gofrit"
42,17,30,"So it will be on the yom when the Ben HaAdam"
42,17,31,"On that yom let not anyone on the rooftop come down back inside for any of his property in the bais, and the one in a sadeh likewise let him not turn back for things left behind."
42,17,32,"Have zikaron of the isha of Lot. [Bereshis 19:26]"
42,17,33,"Whoever seeks to preserve his Chayyim will lose it, but whoever loses it, will preserve it."
42,17,34,"I say to you, in this lailah there will be two in one bed:  one will be taken and the other will be left."
42,17,35,"There will be two grinding at the same place: one will be taken, but the other will be left."
42,17,36,"missing fehlt/missing"
42,17,37,"And in reply they say to him, Where, Adoneinu? But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Where the guf"
42,18,1,"Now he was speaking a mashal"
42,18,2,"Saying, A certain dayan"
42,18,3,"Now an almanah was in that shtetl and she was coming to him saying, Grant me yashrus"
42,18,4,"And for a zman he was not willing. But after these things he said to himself, `If indeed Hashem I do not fear nor bnei Adam I respect,"
42,18,5,"`yet because this almanah causes me tzoros and is such a nudge, I will grant yashrus"
42,18,6,"Now Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu said, Listen to what the unrighteous dayan says."
42,18,7,"Now will not Hashem by all means do mishpat for his Bechirim  crying out to him yomam valailah?  Will he delay long in bringing them help? [Shemot 22:23; Tehillim 88:1]"
42,18,8,"I say to you that Hashem will bring about their mishpat swiftly, but when the Ben HaAdam"
42,18,9,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said this mashal also to some, who have become soimech"
42,18,10,"Shnei anashim went up to the Beis Hamikdash to daven, one was a Perush and the other, a moches"
42,18,11,"The Perush was standing by himself, davening, and his tefillah went like this: `Adonoi, Modeh Ani that I am not like other men, swindlers, resha'im, mena'afim"
42,18,12,"`I undergo a tzom"
42,18,13,"But the moches"
42,18,14,"I say to you, this one, rather than the other one, went down to his bais having been made yitzdak im Hashem. Because everyone lifting himself up will be brought low, but the one bringing himself low will be uplifted.  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH ON THE SUBJECT OF CHINUCH HABANOS"
42,18,15,"Now also they were bringing to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach ollelim"
42,18,16,"But Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach called for them saying, Permit the yeladim to come to me and do not hinder them, for of such ones is the Malchut Hashem."
42,18,17,"Omein I say to you, whoever does not welcome the Malchut Hashem as a yeled, may by no means enter into it. REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND ONE OF THE BAALE-BATTIM OF YISROEL, WHO BECAUSE OF HIS LACK OF PERCEPTION OF TRUE RICHES, PASSES BY THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S S'MICHAH AND MINISTRY"
42,18,18,"And a certain one of the manhigim"
42,18,19,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Why do you call me tov? No one is tov except Hashem alone."
42,18,20,"You have da'as of the Mitzvot. LO TINAF, LO TIRTZACH, LO TIGNOV, LO TA'ANEH V'REI'ACHAH AD SHAKER, KABEID ES A'VICHA V'ES IMMECHAH. [Shemot 20:12-16; Devarim 5:16-20]"
42,18,21,"And he said, `In all these things I have been shomer mitzvot and frum from my kinder-yoren.'"
42,18,22,"And having heard, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Still one thing for you is lacking. Everything as much as you have, sell and distribute to the aniyim"
42,18,23,"But having heard these things he became very sad.  For he  had much kesef."
42,18,24,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, when he saw him become agmat nefesh, said, How difficult it is for the ones having osher to enter into the Malchut Hashem. [Mishle 11:28]"
42,18,25,"For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for an ish ashir to enter into the Malchut Hashem."
42,18,26,"But the ones having heard said, Then who is able to come to Yeshu'at Eloheinu?"
42,18,27,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, The things impossible with bnei Adam are possible with Hashem."
42,18,28,"And Kefa said, Hinei, we having left everything to follow you."
42,18,29,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Omein, I say to you, that there is no one who left bais or isha or achim or horim"
42,18,30,"who will not receive many times as much in this zman and in the Olam HaBah, Chayyei Olam. REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND HIS THIRD NEVU'AH CONCERNING HIS MAVET AND TECHIYAS HAMESIM; THE BINAH OF THIS NOT YET MEFURSAM"
42,18,31,"And having taken the Shneym Asar aside in a yechidus, he said to them, Hinei, we are making another aliyah leregel to Yerushalayim, and all the things having been written by the Nevi'im about the Ben HaAdam"
42,18,32,"For he"
42,18,33,"and, having laid the shot"
42,18,34,"And they had chochma regarding none of these things and this dvar was nistar"
42,18,35,"And it came about while Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach drew near to Yericho, a certain ivver was sitting beside the road begging."
42,18,36,"And having heard a multitude traveling through, he was asking what this might be."
42,18,37,"And they reported to him that Yehoshua of Natzeret is going by."
42,18,38,"And he cried out saying, Ben Dovid!  Chaneni!"
42,18,39,"And the ones going past him were rebuking him that he should be silent, but he much more was crying out, Ben Dovid, chaneni!"
42,18,40,"And stopping, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach commanded the ivver to be led to him.  Having drawn near, he asked him, What for you do you wish that I may do?"
42,18,41,"And he said, Adoni, that I may regain my sight."
42,18,42,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Regain your sight.  Your emunah"
42,18,43,"And at once he saw again and was following Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach shouting, Baruch Hashem! And all the people who were edey re'iyah"
42,19,1,"And having entered, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was passing through Yericho."
42,19,2,"And, hinei, a man by name Zakkai was there and he was a chief moches"
42,19,3,"And he was seeking to catch a look at Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach  and was not able because of the multitude, and because in stature he was short."
42,19,4,"And having run ahead to the front, he climbed up onto an aitz"
42,19,5,"And as he came to the place, having looked up, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Zakkai, hurry and come down, for hayom in your bais it is necessary for me to remain."
42,19,6,"And having hurried, he came down and welcomed Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach with simcha."
42,19,7,"And everyone, having seen this, were beginning to kvetsh"
42,19,8,"And Zakkai stood there and said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu, Hinei, half of my possessions, Adoni, I give as tzedakah to the aniyim, and if from someone I defrauded of anything I am paying back arbatayim"
42,19,9,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Hayom Yeshu'at Eloheinu has come to this bais, because also he is a Ben Avraham."
42,19,10,"For the Ben HaAdam"
42,19,11,"Now as they were hearing these things, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach added a mashal"
42,19,12,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, A certain man of noble birth traveled to a distant country to get for himself royal power for his malchut and to return."
42,19,13,"And having summoned aseret avadim of his, he gave them asarah minas and he said to them, `Conduct esek"
42,19,14,"But his subjects were hating him and they sent a delegation after him saying, `We do not want this one to rule over us.'"
42,19,15,"And it came about when he returned, having received the royal power of his malchut, he summoned to his presence these avadim to whom he had given the kesef, that he might have da'as of what they had gained by trading."
42,19,16,"And having come, the rishon"
42,19,17,"`Yafeh asita, Eved tov, because you have been ne'eman in a very small thing, have shlita"
42,19,18,"And the sheni"
42,19,19,"And he said also to this one, `And you have shlita over chamash shtetlach.'"
42,19,20,"And the other came saying, `Adoni, hinei!  Your mina which I had put away in a servetke"
42,19,21,"`For I was fearing you, because you are a big machmir"
42,19,22,"He says to him, `From your own mouth I will judge you,  eved rasha.  You had da'as that I am a big machmir"
42,19,23,"`Why did you not then put my kesef into the bank?  Then when I came I would have collected ribit"
42,19,24,"And to the ones having stood nearby he said, `Take from him the mina and give it to the one having asarah minas.'"
42,19,25,"And they said to him, `Adoneinu, he has asarah minas!'"
42,19,26,"`I say to you that to everyone having, more will be given, but from the one not having, even what he has will be taken away."
42,19,27,"`But these oyevim of me, the ones not wanting me to have the shlita over them, bring them here and execute them before me.'"
42,19,28,"And having said these things, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was traveling ahead making his aliyah leregel to Yerushalayim.  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTO YERUSHALAYIM"
42,19,29,"And it came about as he came near to Beit-Pagey and Beit-Anyah to the Mount of Olives, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sent shnayim of the talmidim"
42,19,30,"saying, Go to the shtetl ahead of you, in which entering you will find an AYIR having been tied, upon which none among bnei Adam ever sat, and having untied it, bring it here."
42,19,31,"And if someone asks you, `Why are you untying it?' you will say this, `Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu has need of it.'"
42,19,32,"And having departed, the ones having been sent found it just as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach told them."
42,19,33,"And while untying the AYIR, its owners said to them, Why are you untying the AYIR?"
42,19,34,"And they said, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu has need of it."
42,19,35,"And they led it to him and, having thrown their kaftans on the AYIR, they put Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach on it."
42,19,36,"And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach rode along, the people were spreading their garments on the road. [Melachim Bais 9:13]"
42,19,37,"And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was now approaching the path that makes the descent from the Mount of Olives, all the multitude of the Rebbe's talmidim began with simcha to shout Baruch Hashem! with a kol gadol for all the nifla'ot and gevurot Hashem of which they had been edey re'iyah"
42,19,38,"saying, BARUCH HABAH, HaMelech B'SHEM ADONOI!  Shalom b'Shomayim!  And kavod in the Highest! [Tehillim 118:26]"
42,19,39,"And some of the Perushim from the multitude said to him, Rabbi, rebuke your talmidim!"
42,19,40,"And in reply Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, I say to you if these will be silent, the avanim"
42,19,41,"And as he came near, having seen the Ir, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach wept over it, [Yeshayah 22:4]"
42,19,42,"saying. If you had only had da'as in HaYom HaZeh of the things leading to shalom, but now it was nistar"
42,19,43,"Because yamim will come upon you and your oyevim will construct a siege against you and they will surround you and will hem you in from all directions. [Yeshayah 29:3; Yirmeyah 6:6; Yechezkel 4:2; 28:6]"
42,19,44,"And they will dash you to the ground and your yeladim with you, and they will not leave an even"
42,19,45,"And having entered into the Beis HaMikdash, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach began to throw out the sellers,"
42,19,46,"saying to them, It has been written, BEITI BEIT TEFILLAH YIKAREI, but you made it a ME'ARAT PARITZIM. [Yeshayah 56:7; Yirmeyah 7:11]"
42,19,47,"And he was saying shiurim yom yom in the Beis Hamikdash. But the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim were seeking to kill him and also the Rashei HaAm,"
42,19,48,"and they were not finding what they might do, for HaAm were all hanging on his every word."
42,20,1,"And it came about on one of the yamim Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying shiurim to HaAm in the Beis Hamikdash and was preaching the Besuras HaGeulah, and the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim with the Ziknei HaAm stood by,"
42,20,2,"and they spoke, saying to him, Tell us by what shlita"
42,20,3,"And in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, I will also confront you will a sh'eilah, and you tell me:"
42,20,4,"The tevilah of teshuva of Yochanan--was it from Shomayim or from bnei Adam?"
42,20,5,"And they reasoned to themselves saying, If we say, from Shomayim, he will say, why did you not believe him?"
42,20,6,"But if we say, from bnei Adam, HaAm all will subject us to  sequilah"
42,20,7,"And they answered that they did not have da'as of the origin of the tevilah of teshuva of Yochanan."
42,20,8,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Neither am I telling you by what shlita"
42,20,9,"And he began to tell this mashal to HaAm Yisroel.  A certain ish planted a kerem and leased it to koremim"
42,20,10,"And in season he sent to the koremim"
42,20,11,"And he proceeded to send another eved.  But him also, when they had beaten and dishonored him, they sent away empty."
42,20,12,"And he proceeded to send an eved shlishi. And also this one, having wounded, they threw out."
42,20,13,"And the Adon of the kerem, said, `What should I do?  I will send Beni Ahuvi.  Perhaps this one they will respect.'"
42,20,14,"But having seen him, the koremim"
42,20,15,"And having driven him outside the kerem, they killed him.  What then will the Ba'al HaKerem do to them?"
42,20,16,"He will come and will destroy these koremim"
42,20,17,"But having looked at them, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, What then is this which has been written: EVEN MA'ASU HAY'TAH LEROSH PINAH"
42,20,18,"Everyone having fallen upon that even"
42,20,19,"And the Sofrim and the Rashei Hakohenim sought to lay their hands upon him in the same hour, but they were afraid of HaAm Yisroel, for they knew that he spoke against them this mashal"
42,20,20,"And having watched carefully, they sent spies pretending themselves to be tzaddikim, that they might catch him in his dvar, so as to deliver him to the rulers and the manhigim under the Moshel."
42,20,21,"And they set a sh'eilah before Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, Rabbi, we have da'as that you speak beemes"
42,20,22,"Is it mutar"
42,20,23,"But having noticed their arum"
42,20,24,"Show me a denarius.  Whose demut has it? And whose inscription?  And they said, Caesar's."
42,20,25,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Then give the things of Caesar to Caesar and the things of Hashem to Hashem."
42,20,26,"And they were not able to catch him in his dvar before the people and, having marveled at his teshuvah"
42,20,27,"And some of the Tz'dukim having approached"
42,20,28,"saying, Rabbi, Moshe Rabbenu laid it down in writing to us, if someone's ach dies and has an isha, and UVEN EIN LO"
42,20,29,"Now there were shiva achim. And the first took an isha, and died UVEN EIN LO"
42,20,30,"And the second"
42,20,31,"and the third took her, and likewise also the seventh did not leave behind a ben and they all died."
42,20,32,"And lemaskana"
42,20,33,"The isha, then, in the Techiyas HaMesim, of which of them does she become the wife?"
42,20,34,"For shiva had her as isha. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, The banim of Olam Hazeh marry and are given in marriage,"
42,20,35,"but the ones having been considered worthy to attain to the Olam HaBah and the Techiyas HaMesim neither marry nor are given in marriage."
42,20,36,"For neither is it possible any longer for them to die, for they are like malachim and they are bnei haElohim, being bnei haTechiyas HaMesim."
42,20,37,"But that the Mesim are made to stand up alive, even Moshe revealed at the burning bush, as he calls Adonoi ELOHEI AVRAHAM ELOHEI YITZCHAK V'ELOHEI YA'AKOV. [Shemot 3:6]"
42,20,38,"But Hashem is not the G-d of Mesim but is Elohei HaChayyim, for to Hashem all are alive."
42,20,39,"And in reply some of the Sofrim said, Rabbi, you spoke well."
42,20,40,"For no longer were they daring to set a sh'eilah before him regarding anything. REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH GIVES US THE TRUE DAAS TORAH INTERPRETATION OF TEHILLIM 110:1; REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS MORE THAN DOVID'S BEN, HE IS ALSO DOVID'S ADON"
42,20,41,"And he said to them, How do they say that the Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach is to be Dovid's son?"
42,20,42,"For Dovid himself says in the book of Tehillim, `NE'UM HASHEM L'ADONI: SHEV LIMINI,"
42,20,43,"`AD ASHIT OYVECHA L'RAGLECHA. [Tehillim 110:1]"
42,20,44,"Therefore, if Dovid calls him Adon, how is he [merely] ben Dovid?  REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH ATTACKS VAIN TRAPPINGS OF CHASHIVUT IN THE SHUL AS WELL AS ABUSES OF SAMCHUT"
42,20,45,"In the hearing of all the people, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to his talmidim,"
42,20,46,"Beware of the Sofrim, the ones wanting to strut around in long kaftans and loving formal `Shalom' greetings in the market places and the rashei hamoshavot"
42,20,47,"who devour the batim of the almanot and for the sake of appearance daven lengthy tefillos"
42,21,1,"And having looked up, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw the ashirim putting into Beis Hamikdash Otzar"
42,21,2,"And he saw a certain poor almanah putting in there two leptas."
42,21,3,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Omein, I say to you that this poor almanah put in more tzedakah than everyone."
42,21,4,"For all these from the things abounding to them put in matanot"
42,21,5,"And as some were speaking about the Beis Hamikdash that with beautiful avanim"
42,21,6,"Yamim will come in which of these things which you see there will not be left an even"
42,21,7,"And they questioned him, saying, Rebbe, when therefore will  these things be and what will be the ot"
42,21,8,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Beware, you should not be deceived. For many will come b'Shem of me saying, `I am he [I am the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach]. And, the time has drawn near.'  Do not follow after them."
42,21,9,"But whenever you hear about wars and intifadas, do not be a pachdan"
42,21,10,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, Ethnic group will have an intifada against ethnic group and malchut against malchut, [Divrey Hayamim Bais 15:6; Yeshayah 19:2]"
42,21,11,"There will be great earthquakes and in various places ra'av and makkot, both horrible portents and great moftim in Shomayim. [Yeshayah 29:6; Yoel 2:30]"
42,21,12,"But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and bring redifot on you, handing you over to the shuls and the batei hasohar, being led away before melachim"
42,21,13,"It will turn out for you to be an opportunity for edut"
42,21,14,"Therefore keep in your levavot not to prepare to defend yourselves."
42,21,15,"For I will give to you a peh and chochmah which they will not be able to resist or to contradict, all of your mitnaggedim"
42,21,16,"And you will be handed over also by horim and achim and kerovim and chaverim, and they will have some of you executed to die al kiddush ha-Shem,"
42,21,17,"and you will be the focus of sinas chinam from everyone because of my name"
42,21,18,"And not even a hair of your rosh will by any means perish."
42,21,19,"In your savlanut you will gain your nefashot"
42,21,20,"But when you see Yerushalayim being surrounded by machanot"
42,21,21,"Then the ones in Yehudah, flee to the mountains and the ones inside HaIr, let them get out, and the ones in the sadot let them not enter into HaIr,"
42,21,22,"Because these are the Yemei NaKam"
42,21,23,"Oy to the ones with child and to the ones nursing in  yamim hahem. For there will be Tzarah Gedolah upon Eretz Yisroel and ka'as"
42,21,24,"and they will fall by the edge of the cherev and they will all be led captive into the Golus, and Yerushalayim will be trampled down by the goyim, until the times of the Goyim are fulfilled.  [Yeshayah 5:5; 63:18; Daniel 8:13]"
42,21,25,"And there will be otot"
42,21,26,"bnei Adam will be fainting from pachad and from expectation of the things coming upon the Olam Hazeh, for the kochot"
42,21,27,"And then you will see the Ben HaAdam"
42,21,28,"And when reshit of these things occurs, stand erect and lift up your roshim, because the Geulah of you draws near. THE MASHAL OF THE AITZ TE'ENAH; THE CHIDUSH"
42,21,29,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach told a mashal"
42,21,30,"When they sprout leaves already, you see for yourselves and you have da'as that Kayits"
42,21,31,"So also you, when you see these things happening, you have da'as that the Malchut Hashem is near."
42,21,32,"Omein, I say to you, that HaDor HaZeh will not pass away until all these things may occur."
42,21,33,"HaShomayim and Ha'Aretz will pass away, but my dvarim will by no means pass away."
42,21,34,"And be shomer regarding yourselves lest your levavot may be burdened with dissipation and drunkenness and the cares of the Olam HaZeh and Yom HaHu may come upon you suddenly"
42,21,35,"as a mokesh"
42,21,36,"But be alert, always davening that you may be able to escape all these things that are about to happen and that you may be able to stand before the Ben HaAdam"
42,21,37,"Now in those days Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying shiurim in the Beis Hamikdash, and balailah he was going out  into the Mount of Olives."
42,21,38,"And all the people were getting up early in the boker to come to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach in the Beis Hamikdash to hear him."
42,22,1,"And the Chag HaMatzot was approaching, the feast called Pesach."
42,22,2,"And the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim were seeking how they might destroy him, for they were afraid of the people. BETRAYING THE REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH: THE ACT OF YEHUDAH FROM K'RIOT"
42,22,3,"And Hasatan entered into Yehudah, the one being called Yehudah from K'riot, being one of the Shneym Asar."
42,22,4,"And having departed, Yehudah spoke with the Rashei Hakohanim and Guard of the Beis Hamikdash how he might hand him over to them."
42,22,5,"And they got a lot of geshmak out of this, and they agreed to pay him kesef. [Zecharyah 11:12]"
42,22,6,"And Yehudah consented and he was seeking an opportunity to betray him when there was no multitude with them. PREPARING FOR PESACH WITH REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH"
42,22,7,"Shoin"
42,22,8,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sent Kefa and Yochanan having said, Go and make our preparations that we may eat and have the Pesach Seder."
42,22,9,"And they said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Where do you wish that we should prepare it?"
42,22,10,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Hinei!  When you enter into HaIr, you will meet a man carrying a jar of mayim. Follow him into the bais into which he enters,"
42,22,11,"And you will say to the Ba'al Bayit, `The Rabbi says to you, Where is the mekom linah"
42,22,12,"And that one will show you a large upstairs cheder"
42,22,13,"And having departed they found things just as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had told them and they prepared the Seder."
42,22,14,"And when the hour came, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach reclined at tish and the Moshiach's Shluchim were with him."
42,22,15,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, With great tshuka"
42,22,16,"For I say to you that I may by no means eat it until it is fulfilled in the Malchut Hashem.   REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S FINAL HAMOTZI AND BERAKHAH AT HIS SEUDAH"
42,22,17,"And having taken a [Kiddush Cup) kos, having made the beracha, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Take this and share it among yourselves,"
42,22,18,"For I say to you that by no means may I drink from now from the p'ri hagefen until the Malchut Hashem comes."
42,22,19,"And having taken matzah and having made the ha-Motzi, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach offered the betzi'at halechem and gave it to them, saying, This is my guf"
42,22,20,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took the kos"

42,22,49,"But having seen what was coming, the ones around Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Adoni, should we strike with the cherev?"
42,22,50,"And a certain one of them struck the eved of the Rashei Hakohanim and cut off his right ear."
42,22,51,"And, in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, Blaib shtein!"
42,22,52,"And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to the ones having come against him, the Rashei Hakohenim and the Beis Hamikdash shomrim and the Ziknei HaAm, Do you have the chutzpah to come out as against a ganav with charavot and clubs?"
42,22,53,"Yom Yom I was with you in the Beis Hamikdash and you did not stretch out your hands against me, but this is your hour and the shlita of choshech"

42,22,62,"And having gone outside Kefa wept bitterly."
42,22,63,"And the men, the ones having Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach in custody were ridiculing him and beating him."
42,22,64,"And having blindfolded him, they were setting a sh'eilah in front of him, saying, Give a dvar nevu'ah, who is the one having given you a klap"
42,22,65,"And with much other Chillul Hashem gadfanut they were speaking against Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
42,22,66,"And when boker came, the Ziknei HaAm were gathered together, both the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim, and they led him away to their Sanhedrin,"
42,22,67,"saying, If you are the Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, tell us.  But he said to them, If I say this to you, you will by no means have emunah."
42,22,68,"And if I set a sh'eilah before you, you will by no means give teshuvah."
42,22,69,"But from now on the Ben HaAdam"
42,22,70,"And everyone said, Then you are the Ben HaElohim?  Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, You are saying that I am."

43,1,45,"Philippos finds Natan'el and says to him, He whom Moshe Rabbenu wrote of in the Sefer Torah, he whom the Nevi'im also wrote of--Yehoshua ben Yosef [ben Dovid], from Natzeret--we have found! [Devarim 18:18; Yeshayah 7:14; 9:5[6]; Yechezkel 34:23]"
43,1,46,"And Natan'el said to Philippos, Can anything good come out of Natzeret? [7:41; Yeshayah 11:1; Zecharyah 6:11-12] Philippos says to Natan'el, Bo'u u're'u!"
43,1,47,"Yehoshua saw Natan'el coming to him, and he says,Hinei! A genuine Ben Yisroel, in whom is no tarmit"
43,1,48,"Natan'el says to How do you have da'as of me?  In reply, Yehoshua said to him, Before you received your keri'ah from Philippos, while you were beneath the aitz te'enah"
43,1,49,"In reply, Natan'el said to him, Rebbe, you are the Ben HaElohim [SHEMUEL BAIS 7:14; TEHILLIM 2:7; 89:26-27], the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach of Yisroel.  YEHOSHUA ALLOWS HIMSELF TO BE ADDRESSED AS REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH BUT ADDS THE ADDITIONAL MESSIANIC TITLE FROM DANIEL 7:13-14 OF THE BEN HAADAM"
43,1,50,"In reply, Yehoshua said to Natan'el, Because I told you that I watched you beneath the aitz te'enah, do you have emunah"
43,1,51,"And he says to Natan'el, Omein, omein, I say to you, you will see Shomayim having been opened and malachim"
43,2,1,"On Yom HaShelishi, there was a Chassuna"
43,2,2,"He and his talmidim were also invited to the chassuna"
43,2,3,"And when yayin"
43,2,4,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to her, Mah lanu valach, Isha? [Bereshis 3:15]  My sha'ah"
43,2,5,"The Em"
43,2,6,"Now there were shesh"
43,2,7,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them. Fill with mayim.  And they filled them up to the top."
43,2,8,"And he says to them, Draw now and bring to the Rosh of the Mesibba"
43,2,9,"And when the Rosh HaMesibba tasted the mayim having become yayin, and when he did not have da'as of where it came from"
43,2,10,"And the Rosh HaMesibba says to him,  Everyone sets out the yayin hatov first, and when they have become drunk, he sets out the inferior; you have kept the yayin hatov until now. THE TALMIDIM AND BECOMING MEKABEL REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH, ACCEPTANCE OF YEHOSHUA AS REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH B'VADAY"
43,2,11,"This was the reshit"
43,2,12,"After this he went down to K'far-Nachum and the Em"
43,2,13,"And Pesach was fast approaching, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went up to Yerushalayim [Devarim 16:1-6]."
43,2,14,"And he found in the Beis Hamikdash the ones selling oxen and sheep and doves [Vayikra 1:14; Devarim 14:26] and the coin dealers sitting [Devarim 14:25]."
43,2,15,"And having made a shot"
43,2,16,"And to the ones selling doves, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Take these things from here.  Do not make the bais Avi a bais hasokhareem"
43,2,17,"The talmidim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach remembered that it had been written, KINAT BETECHA AKHALATNI  (The zeal for the your bais will devour me [TEHILLIM 69:9]."
43,2,18,"In reply, those of Yehudah then said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, What ot"
43,2,19,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them Bring churban to this heikhal and in shloshah yamim [Yonah 1:17; Hoshea 6:2] I will raise it."
43,2,20,"Those of Yehudah then said, In forty and six years this heikhal was built and you in shloshah yamim will raise it?"
43,2,21,"But that one was speaking about the heikhal of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's geviyah. [Bereshis 47:18; Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:10-11]"
43,2,22,"Therefore, when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach underwent the Techiyas Hamesim"
43,2,23,"And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was in Yerushalayim during Pesach at the Chag"
43,2,24,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was not entrusting himself to them, because he had da'as of kol Bnei Adam."
43,2,25,"And he had no need that anyone should give solemn edut"
43,3,1,"Now there was a man of the Perushim.  His name was Nakdimon, a manhig haYehudim."
43,3,2,"This one came to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach during the lailah and said to him, Rabbi, we have da'as that from Hashem you have come, a moreh, for no one is able these otot"
43,3,3,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Omein, omein, I say to you, unless someone is born anew [1:13; Devarim 10:16; 30:6; Yirmeyah 4:4; Yeshayah 52:1; Yechezkel 44:7,9], he not able to see the Malchut Hashem."
43,3,4,"Nakdimon says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, How is a man, being old, able to be born? Surely he is not able into the womb of his Em"
43,3,5,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Omein, omein, I say to you: unless someone is born of mayim"
43,3,6,"That which is born of basar is basar, and that which is born of the Ruach is ruach."
43,3,7,"Do not marvel that I said to you, `It is necessary for you to be born anew.'"
43,3,8,"The ruach"
43,3,9,"In reply, Nakdimon said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, How is it possible for these things to happen?"
43,3,10,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, You hold the teaching office of rabbi of Yisroel and of these things you do not have da'as?"
43,3,11,"Omein, omein, I say to you, that of which we have da'as we speak, and of that which we have seen, we give solemn edut"
43,3,12,"If I told you [pl.] about things of the Olam Hazeh and you have no emunah, how will you have emunah if I tell you about the things of the Olam Haba?"
43,3,13,"And no one has ascended into Shomayim except the one having descended out of Shomayim, the Ben HaAdam [Daniel 7:13-14; Mishle 30:4; Devarim 30:12]."
43,3,14,"And as Moshe lifted up the nachash in the wilderness [Bamidbar 21:8,9], so it is necessary for there to be a HAGBA"
43,3,15,"that everyone having emunah [Bereshis 15:6; Bamidbar 14:11; Shemot 14:31] in him may have Chayyei Olam [Daniel 12:2; Yeshayah 52:13]."
43,3,16,"For Hashem so had ahavah"
43,3,17,"For Hashem did not send the Ben HaElohim into the Olam Hazeh that he might judge the Olam Hazeh, but that the Olam Hazeh might be brought to the time of the Geulah and the Olam Haba through him"
43,3,18,"The one of emunah who is mekabel Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach"
43,3,19,"And this is the din"
43,3,20,"For everyone walking in the derech resha'im has sin'ah"
43,3,21,"But the one doing HaEmes comes to the Ohr"
43,3,22,"After these things Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and his talmidim came into the land of Yehudah and there he was staying with them and was administering the mikveh mayim's tevilah."
43,3,23,"And Yochanan was also administering the tevilah near Shalem at Einayim, because there was plenty of water there for a mikveh, and the Jewish people were coming and submitting to the tevilah."
43,3,24,"Yochanan had not yet been incarcerated in the beit hasohar"
43,3,25,"There was then a discussion of Yochanan's talmidim with one of the Yehudim about the subject of tohorah"
43,3,26,"And they came to Yochanan and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Yarden, the one to whom you have given solemn edut, hinei, this one administers the mikveh mayim's tevilah and all Bnei Adam are coming to him."
43,3,27,"In reply, Yochanan said, A man is not able to receive anything, unless it has been given to him from Shomayim."
43,3,28,"You yourselves bear 'ed"
43,3,29,"The one having the Kallah"
43,3,30,"It is necessary for that one"
43,3,31,"The one coming from above"
43,3,32,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gives solemn edut"
43,3,33,"The One who has received Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's edut has thereby set his chatam"
43,3,34,"For he whom Hashem sent speaks the Divrei Hashem"
43,3,35,"Elohim HaAv"
43,3,36,"The one with emunah in HaBen"
43,4,1,"Therefore when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach knew that the Perushim heard that he makes more talmidim and administers the tevilah of teshuva to more talmidim than Yochanan"
43,4,2,"--although Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach himself did not personally administer the mikveh mayim's tevilah, this was administered by his talmidim"
43,4,3,"--then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach left the land of Yehudah and departed again into the Galil. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AT THE WELL OF YA'AKOV AVINU"
43,4,4,"And it was necessary for him to pass through Shomron"
43,4,5,"Therefore, he comes into a city of Shomron"
43,4,6,"Now a be'er"
43,4,7,"An isha"
43,4,8,"For Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim had gone away into the city that they might buy okhal"
43,4,9,"Therefore, the isha"
43,4,10,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to her, If you knew the matanah"
43,4,11,"The isha"
43,4,12,"Surely you are not greater than Ya'akov Avinu who gave the matanah to us of the be'er"
43,4,13,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Everyone drinking from this mayim"
43,4,14,"but whoever drinks of the mayim"
43,4,15,"The isha"
43,4,16,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to her, Go, call your ish, and come here."
43,4,17,"In reply, the isha"
43,4,18,"For beetzem"
43,4,19,"The isha says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni, I see that you are a Navi."
43,4,20,"Avoteinu on this mountain"
43,4,21,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to her, Have emunah"
43,4,22,"You worship that of which you do not have da'as [Melachim Bais 17:28-41]; we worship that of which we have da'as, because Yeshu'at Eloheinu"
43,4,23,"But a sha'ah"
43,4,24,"Hashem is Ruach"
43,4,25,"The isha says to him, I have da'as that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is coming, the one being called the Messiah.  When Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes, he will proclaim to us everything."
43,4,26,"Yehoshua says to her, Ani Hu"
43,4,27,"And at this very moment, the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim arrived, and they were marveling that he was speaking with an isha"
43,4,28,"Therefore, the isha left her waterpot and went away into the city and says to the bnei Adam of the city,"
43,4,29,"Come, see an ish who told me everything I have ever done. Surely this one is not Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, is he?"
43,4,30,"They came out of the city and were coming to him.  THE OKHEL OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS TO DO THE RATZON HASHEM; COMPLETING HIS WORK SHOULD BE THE SHIRAYIM OF THE HARVESTERS"
43,4,31,"Divaile"
43,4,32,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, I have okhel"
43,4,33,"Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim were saying to one another, Surely no one brought him anything to eat?"
43,4,34,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, My okhel"
43,4,35,"Do not say, `Yet arba'ah chodashim"
43,4,36,"the one harvesting receives wages and gathers p'ri"
43,4,37,"For in this the saying is true, `One sows and another harvests.' [Iyov 31: 8; Michoh 6:15]"
43,4,38,"I sent you to harvest that upon which you have not labored; others have labored and you have entered into their labor."
43,4,39,"And from that city of Shomron"
43,4,40,"Then when those of Shomron came to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, they were asking him to remain with them, and he remained with them there two yamim"
43,4,41,"And many more put their emunah [in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach], because of his dvar"
43,4,42,"And to the isha they were saying, No longer because of what you spoke do we have emunah"
43,4,43,"And after two yamim"
43,4,44,"For Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach himself gave solemn edut"
43,4,45,"Therefore, when he came into the Galil, those of the Galil received Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, vi-bahlt"
43,4,46,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came again into Kanah of the Galil where he made the mayim"
43,4,47,"This man, having heard that Yehoshua comes from the land of Yehudah into the Galil, went to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and was asking him to come down and cure his ben. For the yeled was about to die."
43,4,48,"Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Except you see otot"
43,4,49,"The royal official says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni, come down before my yeled dies."
43,4,50,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, Go! Chai benech!"
43,4,51,"And as the man was going, his avadim met Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saying that the man's yeled lives."
43,4,52,"Therefore, the man inquired from them the sha'ah"
43,4,53,"Therefore, the abba knew that it was the same sha'ah"
43,4,54,"Now this was ot hasheni"
43,5,1,"After these things, there was a Chag"
43,5,2,"Now there is in Yerushalayim at the Sha'ar HaTzon"
43,5,3,"In these were laying a multitude of invalids--ivrim"
43,5,4,"missing fehlt/missing"
43,5,5,"and there was a certain man there SHELOSHIM U'SHEMONEH SHANAH [Devarim 2:14] having been in his machla"
43,5,6,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, seeing this man lying there, and having da'as that the man had been in this condition for a long time already, says to him, Do you want to have refu'ah [Yeshayah 53:5]?"
43,5,7,"In reply, the choleh"
43,5,8,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, Rise up, take your mat and walk."
43,5,9,"And immediately the man received his refu'ah"
43,5,10,"So those of Yehudah were saying to the one having been granted refu'ah"
43,5,11,"But the man in reply said to them, The One having given me refu'ah, that One said to me, Take up your mat and walk!"
43,5,12,"They asked him, Who is haIsh"
43,5,13,"But the one having been granted refu'ah"
43,5,14,"After these things Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach finds him in the Beis Hamikdash, and said to him, Hinei, you have received your refu'ah.  No longer commit averos, for fear that something worse happen to you."
43,5,15,"The man went away and reported to the Yehudim that Yehoshua is the one having granted him his refu'ah,"
43,5,16,"and, because of this, those of Yehudah brought redifah"
43,5,17,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach in reply, said them, Avi until now is working and I am working. [Bereshis 2:3]"
43,5,18,"Because of this, therefore, those of Yehudah were seeking all the more to kill Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, because not only was he not Shomer Shabbos, but also Rebbe was saying that his own Av was Hashem, thereby making himself equal with Elohim [1:1]."
43,5,19,"In reply, therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, Omein, omein I say to you, HaBen is not able to do anything from himself except what he sees HaAv doing, for what things that One is doing, these things also the HaBen likewise is doing."
43,5,20,"For HaAv has ahavah for HaBen and all things He shows to Him which He does and ma'asim gedolim"
43,5,21,"For just as HaAv raises the Mesim"
43,5,22,"For not even HaAv judges anyone, but all din"
43,5,23,"that kol Bnei Adam may honor HaBen as they honor HaAv.  The one not honoring HaBen does not honor HaAv who sent him."
43,5,24,"Omein, omein, I say to you, that the one, hearing my dvar and having emunah in the One who sent me, has Chayyei Olam and does not come into the Mishpat Hashem, but has been transferred out of mavet"
43,5,25,"Omein, omein I say to you, that a sha'ah"
43,5,26,"For just as HaAv has Chayyim"
43,5,27,"And samchut"
43,5,28,"Do not marvel at this. For a sha'ah"
43,5,29,"and will come out, the ones having practiced haTov to a Techiyas haMesim of Chayyim"
43,5,30,"I am not able to do from myself anything. As I hear I judge, and mine is mishpat-tzedek [Yeshayah 28:6], because I do not seek my own ratson"
43,5,31,"If I give solemn edut"
43,5,32,"There is another giving solemn edut about me, however, and I have da'as that the edut He testifies about me is ne'emanah"
43,5,33,"You"
43,5,34,"Not that I accept edut from Bnei Adam, but I say these things that you may come to Yeshu'at Eloheinu."
43,5,35,"He [Yochanan] was a menorah burning and shining and you chose to exult for a time in his Ohr"
43,5,36,"but l have edut"
43,5,37,"And HaAv who sent me has Himself given solemn edut"
43,5,38,"and the dvar Hashem you do not have abiding and dwelling in you, because you have no bittachon"
43,5,39,"You search the Kitvei Hakodesh because you think in them you have Chayyei Olam.  And those are the ones giving solemn edut about me."
43,5,40,"And you do not want to come to me that you may have Chayyim."
43,5,41,"I do not accept kavod"
43,5,42,"But I have had da'as of you, that the ahavas Hashem"
43,5,43,"I have come b'Shem Avi and you do not accept me. If another comes in his own name, him you will accept."
43,5,44,"How are you able to have emunah, when you receive kavod from one another, and the kavod from the only Elohim HaEchad you do not seek? [Melachim Bais 19:15,19; Yeshayah 37:20; Daniel 3:45 Targum Ha-Shivim"
43,5,45,"Do not think that I will accuse you before HaAv; however, there is one accusing you: Moshe, in whom you have set your tikvah. [Devarim 31:26-27]"
43,5,46,"For if you were having emunah in Moshe, you would have had emunah in me, for he himself wrote concerning me.[Bereshis 3:15; Devarim 18:15]"
43,5,47,"But if in the Kitvei Hakodesh of that one you lack emunah, how will you have emunah in my dvar?"
43,6,1,"After these things, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach departed beyond Lake Kinneret"
43,6,2,"And a riezige"
43,6,3,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went up to the mountain and there he was sitting with his talmidim."
43,6,4,"Pesach was near at hand, the Jewish Chag"
43,6,5,"Therefore, having lifted up his eyes, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw that a great multitude is coming to Him, and he says to Philippos, From where may we buy lechem that these ones may eat?"
43,6,6,"But he was saying this to test Philippos, for he himself knew what he was about to do."
43,6,7,"In reply, Philippos said, Two hundred denarii worth of lechem would not be enough that each one may take a little something."
43,6,8,"One of his talmidim, Andrew, Shimon Kefa's ach"
43,6,9,"There is a na'ar here who has chamash barley loaves and sheney dagim"
43,6,10,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Instruct the anashim"
43,6,11,"Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took the loaves and, having made the berakhah, distributed to the ones bimesibba"
43,6,12,"Now when they were filled, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach tells his talmidim, Gather the shirayim"
43,6,13,"Therefore, what they gathered filled Sheneym Asar"
43,6,14,"Therefore, the anashim, having seen what ot [miraculous sign] he did, were saying, This one is omein the Navi, Hu HaBah, the one coming into the Olam Hazeh. [Devarim 18:15,18]"
43,6,15,"Therefore, Yehoshua, having had da'as that they are about to come and to seize him that they might force Malkhut"
43,6,16,"And as erev came, his talmidim went down to the sea."
43,6,17,"And having embarked into a sirah"
43,6,18,"And the sea, as a great wind blew, was becoming aroused."
43,6,19,"Therefore, having rowed about esrim v'chamash or sheloshim stadia, they see Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach walking on the sea and coming near the sirah"
43,6,20,"But he says to them, Ani hu. Do not be afraid."
43,6,21,"Therefore, the talmidim were willing to receive him into the sirah"
43,6,22,"On the next day the multitude that had stayed on the other side of Lake Kinneret saw that there had been only one sirah"
43,6,23,"Then some sirot"
43,6,24,"Therefore, when the multitude saw Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is not there, nor his talmidim, they embarked into the sirot"
43,6,25,"And having found him across the sea, they said to him, Rebbe, when did you come here?"
43,6,26,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Omein, omein, I say to you, you are seeking me not because you saw otot"
43,6,27,"Do not work for the okhel"
43,6,28,"Therefore, they said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, What may we do that we may work the pe'ulot of Hashem?"
43,6,29,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, This is the mitzvoh of Hashem, that you may believe in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach whom Hashem has sent."
43,6,30,"They said, therefore, to him, What ot"
43,6,31,"Avoteinu ate the manna in the wilderness [Bamidbar 11:7-9; Shemot 16:4,15; Nechemyah 9:15], as it has been written, Lechem min SHOMAYIM NATAN LAMO LE'EKHOL"
43,6,32,"Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Omein, omein, I say to you, it was not Moshe who has given you the lechem out of Shomayim, but HaAv of me gives you the lechem ha'amiti"
43,6,33,"For the lechem of Hashem is one coming down out of Shomayim and giving Chayyim"
43,6,34,"Therefore, they said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni, always give us this lechem."
43,6,35,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them Ani hu [Shemot 3:14] the lechem haChayyim; the one coming to me never hungers, and the one with emunah in me will never thirst again."
43,6,36,"But I said to you that you have seen me and yet you do not have bittachon, you lack emunah."
43,6,37,"All which HaAv gives to me will come to me, and the one coming to me I will never turn away."
43,6,38,"For I have come down from Shomayim not that I may do the ratson"
43,6,39,"Now this is the ratson"
43,6,40,"For this is the ratson"
43,6,41,"Therefore, those of Yehudah were murmuring about Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, because he said, Ani hu [Shemot 3:14] the lechem having come down out of Shomayim."
43,6,42,"And they were saying, Is this man not Yehoshua Ben Yosef, and do we not know his Av and his Em? How now does he say, Out of Shomayim I have come down."
43,6,43,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered and said to them, Do not grumble among yourselves."
43,6,44,"No one is able to come to me unless HaAv who sent me should draw him, and I will raise him up in Yom HaAcharon. [Yirmeyah 31:3; Hoshea 11:4]"
43,6,45,"It has been written in the Nevi'im, V'CHOL BANAYIHK LIMUDI HASHEM (They shall all be taught of G-d [Yeshayah 54:13; see Yirmeyah 31:33,34] Everyone having heard from HaAv and having learned comes to me."
43,6,46,"Not that anyone has seen HaAv except the One being sent from Hashem; this one has seen HaAv."
43,6,47,"Omein, omein, I say to you, the one having emunah has Chayyei Olam."
43,6,48,"Ani hu the lechem haChayyim. [Bamidbar 14:23; Devarim 1:35]"
43,6,49,"Your Avot ate in the wilderness the manna and died."
43,6,50,"This is the lechem coming down out of Shomayim, so that anyone may eat of it and not die. [Bereshis 3:22]  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH SPEAKS AS THE SEH HAELOHIM"
43,6,51,"Ani hu the lechem haChai"
43,6,52,"Therefore, those of Yehudah were arguing with one another, saying, How is this man able to give us the basar of him to eat?"
43,6,53,"Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Omein, omein, I say to you, unless you eat the basar of the Ben HaAdam and drink his dahm, you do not have Chayyim"
43,6,54,"The one feeding on my basar and drinking dahmi has Chayyei Olam and I will raise him up on the Yom HaAcharon."
43,6,55,"For the basar of me is okhal emes"
43,6,56,"The one feeding on my basar and drinking dahmi abides in and dwells in me and I in him."
43,6,57,"As HaAv haChai sent me and I live because of HaAv, so also whoever is feeding on me even that one will live because of me."
43,6,58,"This is the lechem out of Shomayim having come down, not as the Avot ate and died; the one feeding on this lechem will live l'olam."
43,6,59,"These things Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said in a shul while teaching in K'far-Nachum. THE DIVREI TORAH OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ARE THE DIVREI CHAYYEI OLAM; THE TELUNNAH"
43,6,60,"Therefore, many of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim, having heard, said, Hard is this dvar Torah.  Who is able to hear it? [Yeshayah 53:1]"
43,6,61,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having da'as in himself that his talmidim are grumbling about this, said to them, Does this cause a michshol"
43,6,62,"Therefore, what if you behold the Ben HaAdam ascending where he was Bereshis"
43,6,63,"The Ruach Hakodesh is that which is making alive, the basar does not profit anything.  The devarim which I have spoken to you are as Ruach Hakodesh and they are as Chayyim"
43,6,64,"But there are of you some who do not have emunah"
43,6,65,"And he was saying, Because of this, I have told you that no one is able to come to me unless it has been given to him from HaAv."
43,6,66,"From this time, many of the talmidim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach fell away and no longer followed him as talmidim."
43,6,67,"Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to the Sheneym Asar"
43,6,68,"In reply, Shimon Kefa said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni, to whom will we go? You have the divrei haChayyei Olam."
43,6,69,"And we have bittachon and have trusted with emunah and we have da'as that you are HaKadosh of Hashem"
43,6,70,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Did I not choose you Sheneym Asar"
43,6,71,"Now he was speaking of Yehudah Ben Shimon from K'riot, for, though he was one of the Sheneym Asar, this one was about to betray Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
43,7,1,"And after these things Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach itinerated in the Galil, for he was not wanting to move about in Yehudah, because those of Yehudah were seeking to kill him. THE TIME: NEARLY 15 TISHRI; THE OCCASION: REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH REBUKES HIS HALF-BROTHERS"
43,7,2,"Now the Chag of Sukkot was near.[Vayikra 23:34; Devarim 16:16]"
43,7,3,"His achim then said to him, Leave here and go away into the land of Yehudah, that also your talmidim will see your ma'asim which you do."
43,7,4,"For no one who seeks public notice does anything in besod"
43,7,5,"For not even the achim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach were believing in him. [Tehillim 69:8]"
43,7,6,"Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, My sha'ah has not yet come, but your time is always ready."
43,7,7,"The Olam Hazeh is not capable of sin'ah"
43,7,8,"You make aliyah leregel up to the Chag"
43,7,9,"And having said these things, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach remained in the Galil.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND THE FESTIVAL OF SUKKOT"
43,7,10,"But when the achim of him made aliyah leregel to the Chag"
43,7,11,"Then those of Yehudah were seeking Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach in the Chag"
43,7,12,"And there was much telunnah"
43,7,13,"No one, however, was speaking openly about Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach because of the fear of those of Yehudah."
43,7,14,"But around the middle period of the Chag"
43,7,15,"Therefore, those of Yehudah were marveling, saying, How has this man binah"
43,7,16,"Therefore, in reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, My Torah"
43,7,17,"If anyone wants to do the ratson Hashem, he will have da'as about my Torah, whether it is of Hashem or I speak only from myself. [Tehillim 25:14; 92:16; Bamidbar 16:28]"
43,7,18,"The one speaking from himself seeks his own kavod"
43,7,19,"Has not Moshe given you the Torah? And, as far as the Torah is concerned, none of you is able to be shomer. Why are you seeking to kill me? [Devarim 32:46; Mishle 20:9; Kohelet 7:20; Yeshayah 53:6]"
43,7,20,"The multitude said, You have a shed"
43,7,21,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Of the Pe'ulot of Hashem, I accomplished echad, one pe'ulah, and every one marvels."
43,7,22,"Moshe has given you bris milah--not that bris milah is of Moshe, but it is of the Avot, and on a Shabbos you perpetually perform bris milah. [Bereshis 17:10-14; 21:4; Vayikra 12:3]"
43,7,23,"If a man receives bris milah on Shabbos--and lo tufar Torat Moshe"
43,7,24,"Do not judge according to appearance but judge with mishpat tzedek. [Zecharyah 7:9; Shmuel Alef 16:7; Yeshayah 11:3-4; Vayikra 19:15]  IS THIS THE REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH?"
43,7,25,"Therefore, some of the ones of Yerushalayim were saying, Is it not this man whom they are seeking to kill?"
43,7,26,"And, hinei, he speaks publicly and they say nothing to him. Perhaps the manhigim"
43,7,27,"But this man, we have da'as where he is from; but the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, whenever he comes, no one has da'as where he is from."
43,7,28,"Therefore, in the Beis Hamikdash while teaching, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach cried out, saying, You have da'as of me, and you have da'as of where I am from.  I have not come on my own, but the One who sent me is ne'eman.  He is the One of whom you do not have da'as."
43,7,29,"I have da'as of Him, because from Him Ani hu, and He is the One who sent me."
43,7,30,"Therefore, they were seeking to arrest him, and no one laid a hand on him, because his sha'ah"
43,7,31,"From the multitude, however, many put their bittachon in him, and were saying, The Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, whenever he comes, surely he will not do more otot"
43,7,32,"The Perushim heard the telunnah"
43,7,33,"Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Yet a little time I am with you and I go away to the One having sent me."
43,7,34,"You will seek me and not find me and where Ani hu you are not able to come."
43,7,35,"Therefore, those of Yehudah said to themselves, Where is this man about to journey that we will not find him? Surely he is not about to sojourn to the Golus of the Yevanim"
43,7,36,"What is this dvar which he said, You will seek me and will not find me and where Ani hu, you are not able to come? REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND THE MABBU'A MAYIM CHAYYIM"
43,7,37,"Now on the last day of the Chag, Hoshana Rabbah, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts let him come to me and drink.  [Vayikra 23:36; Yeshayah 55:1; 12:3; 49:10]"
43,7,38,"The one with emunah in me, as the Kitvei Hakodesh said, `Out of the midst of him, rivers of MAYIM CHAYYIM [Zecharyah 14:8] will flow.' [Mishle 18:4; Yeshayah 44:3; 58:11; 43:19f, Yechezkel 47:1-12; Yoel 4:18; Shir HaShirim 4:15]."
43,7,39,"But this Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said about the Ruach Hakodesh which the ones having emunah"
43,7,40,"Some of the multitude, therefore, having heard these dvarim were saying, This man is omein the Navi. [Devarim 18:15]"
43,7,41,"Others were saying, This man is the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. But some were saying, Surely the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes not from the Galil, does he?"
43,7,42,"Has not the Kitvei Hakodesh said that the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is from the zera Dovid and from Beit-Lechem, the shtetl where Dovid lived? [Shmuel Bais 7:12; Tehillim 89:3-4; Michoh 5:1"
43,7,43,"A makhaloket"
43,7,44,"And some of them were wanting to arrest him, but no one laid his hands on Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  MANHIGIM HAVE NO EMUNAH"
43,7,45,"Then the avadim of the Rashei Hakohanim and Perushim came and the Rashei Hakohanim and Perushim said to them, Why did you not bring him?"
43,7,46,"In reply, the avadim said, Never Ish spoke like this Ish."
43,7,47,"In reply, therefore, the Perushim said, Surely not you also have been deceived?"
43,7,48,"Has any of the manhigim put their emunah"
43,7,49,"But this am ha'aretz crowd has no da'as of Torah and is cursed. [Devarim 27:26]"
43,7,50,"Rav Nakdimon, the one having come to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach earlier, being one of their own, says to them,"
43,7,51,"Surely Torateinu"
43,7,52,"They answered and said to Rav Nakdimon, Surely not you also are from the Galil, are you? Search [the Kitvei Hakodesh] and see that from the Galil a Navi does not arise. [Melachim Bais 14:25]"
43,7,53,"And they went each one to him bais."
43,8,1,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went to the Har haZeytim"
43,8,2,"And at shakhar"
43,8,3,"And the Sofrim and the Perushim led an isha"
43,8,4,"they say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Rabbi, this isha"
43,8,5,"Now in our Torah Moshe Rabbeinu gave us a mitzvoh to stone such nashim. You, therefore, what do you say? [Vayikra 20:10; Devarim 22:22-24; Iyov 31:11]"
43,8,6,"But this they were saying to put a nisayon"
43,8,7,"But as they were remaining, questioning him, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach stood up and said to them, The one without chet"
43,8,8,"And again, having stooped down, he was writing in the ground."
43,8,9,"And the ones having heard were departing, one by one, beginning with the zekenim, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was left alone with the isha"
43,8,10,"And having stood up, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to her, Isha, where are they?  Does no one condemn you?"
43,8,11,"And she said, No one, Adoni. And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Neither do I condemn you. Go and practice chet no more. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH THE OHR HAOLAM"
43,8,12,"Then again Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke to them, saying, Ani hu HaOhr HaOlam Hazeh.  The one following me will never walk in choshech"
43,8,13,"Therefore, the Perushim said to him, You give solemn edut"
43,8,14,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Even if I give solemn edut about myself, my edut is ne'emanah, because I have da'as of where I came from and where I go, but you have no da'as of where I come from or where I go."
43,8,15,"You judge according to the basar; I do not judge anyone. [Shmuel Alef 16:7]"
43,8,16,"But even if I judge, my mishpat is emes, because it is not I alone but the one having sent me, HaAv."
43,8,17,"And it has been written even in your Torah, that the edut"
43,8,18,"Ani hu the one giving solemn edut"
43,8,19,"Therefore, they were saying to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Where is HaAv of you? In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, You have da'as of neither me nor HaAv of me. If you had had da'as of me, you would have had da'as of HaAv of me."
43,8,20,"These dvarim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke in the Beis HaOtzar while saying shiurim in the Beis Hamikdash, and no one arrested him, because the sha'ah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had not yet come.  WHERE THE REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS GOING YOU CANNOT COME BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO EMUNAH AND NO KAPPARAH  AND NO HITKHADESHUT"
43,8,21,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, therefore, again to them, I go away and you will seek me, and in your chet you will go to your mavet.  Where I go you are not able to come. [Devarim 24:16; Yechezkel 3:18]"
43,8,22,"Therefore, those of Yehudah were saying, Does he mean he will commit suicide, because he says Where I go you are not able to come?"
43,8,23,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, You are of what is matta"
43,8,24,"I said, therefore, to you that you will go to your mavet in your averos"
43,8,25,"They were saying, therefore, to him, Who are you? Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Why should I even speak to you at all?"
43,8,26,"I have much to speak regarding you, much about you worthy of haresha'ah"
43,8,27,"They did not have da'as that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was speaking to them about Elohim HaAv."
43,8,28,"Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, When you perform the hagba"
43,8,29,"And the One having sent me is with me [Mishle 8:30].  He did not leave me alone, because I always do the things that please Him. [Yeshayah 50:5; 43:10 Targum Ha-Shivim"
43,8,30,"As Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying these things, many put their emunah in him.   THE EMES BRINGS THE EXODUS OF DEROR"
43,8,31,"Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying to the Yehudim who had emunah in him, If you remain in the dvar of me [Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach] then you are my talmidim indeed."
43,8,32,"And you will have da'as of HaEmes"
43,8,33,"They answered Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, We are of the zera Avraham and to no one have we ever been enslaved.  How do you say You will become bnei Chorim"
43,8,34,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them Omein, omein, I say to you that everyone practicing Chet is an eved HaChet. [Bereshis 4:7]"
43,8,35,"But the eved does not remain in the Bais ad Olam. HaBen remains ad Olam. [Bereshis 21:10; Shemot 21:2; Devarim 15:12]"
43,8,36,"If therefore HaBen makes you Bnei Chorim, you shall be Bnei Chorim indeed."
43,8,37,"I have da'as that you are zera Avraham, but you seek to kill me, because my dvar has no place in you."
43,8,38,"What I have seen in the presence of HaAv of me, of that, I make solemn declaration. Therefore, the things  you have heard from your father you do.    THIS SECTION USES MAMZERUT"
43,8,39,"They answered and said unto him, Avinu hu Avraham.  Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, If you were yeladim of Avraham, you would have been doing the ma'asei Avraham."
43,8,40,"But now you are seeking to kill me, a man who has told you HaEmes, which I heard from Hashem; this was not a ma'aseh Avraham did. [Tehillim 15:2]"
43,8,41,"You are doing the ma'asim of your Av. They said, therefore, to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, We are not mamzerim who have been born of zenunim"
43,8,42,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, If Hashem were the Av of you, you would have had ahavah for me, for I came forth from Hashem, and now I am present here, for I have not come on my own, but HaAv sent me."
43,8,43,"Why do you not recognize my lashon? Because you are not able to give obedient shemah"
43,8,44,"You are from the Av of you, Hasatan [Bereshis 3:4-5; Tehillim 58:4"
43,8,45,"But because I speak HaEmes, you do not have bittachon"
43,8,46,"Who among you exposes me concerning chet"
43,8,47,"The one who is of Hashem hears the divrei Hashem. Therefore, you not hear because you are not of Hashem. WHO IS GUILTY OF CHILLUL HASHEM? BEFORE AVRAHAM WAS I AM"
43,8,48,"In reply, those of Yehudah said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Did we not rightly say that you are a Shomroni"
43,8,49,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, I do not have a shed"
43,8,50,"But I do not seek my own kavod; there is one seeking and judging."
43,8,51,"Omein, omein, I say to you, regarding the dvar of me, if anyone is shomer, he will not see mavet l'Olam."
43,8,52,"Therefore, those of Yehudah said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Now we have da'as that you have a shed. Avraham died and the Nevi'im; yet you say if anyone keeps the `dvar of me' he will never taste mavet"
43,8,53,"Surely you are not greater than Avraham Avinu, who died? And the Nevi'im died. Whom do you make yourself to be?"
43,8,54,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, If I give myself kavod, the kavod of me is nothing.  It is HaAv of me who giving me kavod, whom you say, `He is Eloheinu.' [Yeshayah 63:16]"
43,8,55,"And you have not had da'as of him.  But I have had da'as of him.  If I would say that I do not have da'as of him, I will be like you, a shakkeran"
43,8,56,"Avraham your Av had lev same'ach to see the Yom of me [Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach], and he saw it and had simcha. [Bereshis 18:18]"
43,8,57,"Therefore those of Yehudah said to him, You do not yet possess fifty years and yet you have seen Avraham Avinu?"
43,8,58,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Omein, omein, I say to you, before Avraham came into being, Ani hu. [Shemot 3:4; 6:3; Yeshayah 41:4; 43:10,13]"
43,8,59,"Then they took up stones that they might throw at him, but Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was hidden and departed out of the Beis Hamikdash. [Shemot 17:4; Vayikra 24:16; Shmuel Alef 30:6]"
43,9,1,"And passing along, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw a man ivver"
43,9,2,"The talmidim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach asked him, Rebbe, who committed averos, this man or the horim"
43,9,3,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Neither this man sinned nor the horim of him, but that the pe'ulot of Hashem may be manifested in him."
43,9,4,"It is necessary for us to work the pe'ulot of the One having sent me while it is Yom.  Lailah comes when no one is able to work. [Yirmeyah 13:16]"
43,9,5,"When I am in the Olam Hazeh, I am the Ohr HaOlam."
43,9,6,"Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made clay out of the saliva and he anointed the the clay upon his eyes,"
43,9,7,"and said to him, Go wash in the pool of Shiloach! [Melachim Bais 5:10]."
43,9,8,"Therefore, the shakhenim"
43,9,9,"Some were saying, This is the one! Others were saying, No, but it is a man like him.  But the man was saying, I am the one!"
43,9,10,"Therefore, the people were saying to him, How, then, were your eyes opened?"
43,9,11,"In reply, the man said, The one called Yehoshua took clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, Go to Shiloach [Melachim Bais 5:10] and wash. Therefore, having gone, and having washed, I saw!"
43,9,12,"And they said to him, Where is that one?  The man says to them, I do not have da'as of that.  THE PERUSHUIM INVESTIGATE THE HEALING"
43,9,13,"The people lead the man to the Perushim, the man who had formerly been ivver"
43,9,14,"Now it was a Shabbos, during which time period Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach took the clay and opened his eyes."
43,9,15,"Then again also the Perushim were asking him how his eyes were opened, and the man said to them, The man placed clay on my eyes and I washed, and I see."
43,9,16,"Therefore some of the Perushim were saying,This man is not from Hashem, because he is not Shomer Shabbos.  But others were saying, How is a man who is a choteh"
43,9,17,"Therefore, they say to the ivver"
43,9,18,"Therefore, those of Yehudah did not believe that the man had been ivver"
43,9,19,"And they asked the horim, saying, Is this the ben of you, whom you say was born ivver? How, therefore, does he now have sight?"
43,9,20,"In reply, therefore, his horim said, We have da'as that this man is the ben of us and that he was born ivver,"
43,9,21,"but how he sees now we do not have da'as nor do we have da'as of who opened his eyes. Interrogate him.  He is of age.  He will speak for himself."
43,9,22,"His horim said these things, because they were fearing those of Yehudah, for already those of Yehudah had agreed that if any person made hoda'ah"
43,9,23,"Therefore, his horim said, He is of age.  Interrogate him."
43,9,24,"They called a second time, therefore, the man who had been ivver"
43,9,25,"In reply, therefore, he said, If he is a choteh"
43,9,26,"They said, therefore, to him, What did he do to you?  How did he open your eyes?"
43,9,27,"The man answered them, I told you already, and you do not listen.  Why again do you want to hear? Surely not also you want to become his talmidim?"
43,9,28,"And they reviled him and said, You are a talmid of that man, but we are talmidim of Moshe Rabbeinu. [Bamidbar 12:2,8]"
43,9,29,"We have da'as that Hashem has spoken to Moshe Rabbeinu, but this man, we do not have da'as from where he comes."
43,9,30,"In reply, the man said to them, Here is a real cheftza! That you do not have da'as from where he comes, and he opened my eyes!"
43,9,31,"We have da'as that G-d does not listen to chote'im"
43,9,32,"Never vi-bahlt"
43,9,33,"If this man was not from Hashem, he would not be able to do anything."
43,9,34,"They answered and said to him, You were born totally in chatta'im"
43,9,35,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach heard that they threw him out, and, having found him, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Do you have emunah"
43,9,36,"In reply, the man said, And who is he, Adoni, that I have emunah in him [as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach]?"
43,9,37,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, You have seen him, and the one speaking to you is he."
43,9,38,"And the man said, Ani ma'amin, Adoni.  And he fell down prostrate before him."
43,9,39,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, For the sake of Mishpat, I came into the Olam Hazeh, that the ones who are ivver"
43,9,40,"Some of the Perushim heard these things--the ones being with him--and they said to him, Surely we are not ivverim, are we?"
43,9,41,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, If you were ivrim"
43,10,1,"Omein, omein, I say to you, the one not entering through the derech hasha'ar"
43,10,2,"But the one entering through the derech hasha'ar is Ro'eh haTzon"
43,10,3,"To this one the doorkeeper opens, and the tzon hears the Ro'eh's voice and the Ro'eh calls b'shem"
43,10,4,"When the Ro'eh has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the tzon follow the Ro'eh, because they have da'as of the Ro'eh's voice."
43,10,5,"But a zar"
43,10,6,"This figure of speech Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach told them. But those ones did not have binah"
43,10,7,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, therefore, again, Omein, omein, I say to you, Ani hu the derech hasha'ar"
43,10,8,"All who came before me are ganavim"
43,10,9,"I am the derech hasha'ar. Through me, if anyone enters, he will come to yeshu'at Eloheinu and will go in and will go out and will find mir'eh"
43,10,10,"The ganav does not come except in order that he may steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have Chayyim"
43,10,11,"I am the Ro'eh HaTov"
43,10,12,"The hireling, who is not the Ro'eh, of whom the tzon does not belong, sees the ze'ev"
43,10,13,"This happens because he is a hireling and the tzon means nothing to him."
43,10,14,"Ani hu the Ro'eh HaTov, and I have da'as of my tzon and my tzon has da'as of me. [Shemot 33:12]"
43,10,15,"Just as HaAv has da'as of me and I have da'as of HaAv, so I lay down my neshamah for the tzon."
43,10,16,"And another tzon I have which are not of this mikhla"
43,10,17,"Therefore, HaAv has ahavah for me, because I lay down my neshamah that I may take it up again."
43,10,18,"No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have samchut"
43,10,19,"There was a makhaloket"
43,10,20,"And many of them were saying, He has a shed"
43,10,21,"Others said, These dvarim are not of one being possessed of shedim. Surely a shed"
43,10,22,"Then the Chag"
43,10,23,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was walking around in the Beis Hamikdash in the area called Ulam Shlomo"
43,10,24,"Then those of Yehudah encircled Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and were saying to him, How much longer are you going to hold our nishmot in suspense? If you are the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, tell us openly."
43,10,25,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, I did tell you and you do not have emunah.  The pe'ulot"
43,10,26,"But you not have emunah"
43,10,27,"My Tzon hear my voice, and I have da'as of them, and they follow me."
43,10,28,"And I give to them Chayyei Olam and they will never perish and no one will snatch them out of my hand. [Yeshayah 66:22]"
43,10,29,"That which HaAv of me has given me is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch out of the hand of HaAv."
43,10,30,"I and HaAv are echad. [Devarim 6:4; Tehillim 33:6]"
43,10,31,"Again those of Yehudah took up stones that they might stone him."
43,10,32,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Many ma'asim tovim I showed you from HaAv.  Because of which ma'aseh do you stone me?"
43,10,33,"In reply, those of Yehudah said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, For a ma'aseh tov we do not stone you, but for Chillul Hashem and because you being a man make yourself G-d. [Vayikra 24:16]"
43,10,34,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered them, Has it not been written in your Torah, ANI AMARTI ELOHIM ATEM (I said you are g-ds--[Tehillim 82:6] [Shemot 7:1; 22:27 Targum Ha-Shivim"
43,10,35,"If those ones He called g-ds, to whom the Dvar Hashem came-- and lo tufar Kitvei Hakodesh"
43,10,36,"--can you say of the One whom HaAv set apart as HaKadosh and sent into the Olam Hazeh that he commits Chillul Hashem because I said, `Ben haElohim Ani hu?' [Yirmeyah 1:5]"
43,10,37,"If I do not accomplish the pe'ulot of HaAv of me, do not regard me with bittachon."
43,10,38,"But if I do, even if you do not have emunah in me, chotsh"
43,10,39,"They were seeking, therefore, again to seize Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and he eluded their hand.  MANY HAVE EMUNAH IN REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH"
43,10,40,"And he went away again beyond the Yarden to the place where Yochanan was bereshit administering the mikveh mayim's tevilah of teshuvah, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach remained there."
43,10,41,"And many came to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and were saying, Yochanan indeed did no ot"
43,10,42,"And many put their emunah"
43,11,1,"Now there was a certain man, a choleh"
43,11,2,"Now this was the same Miryam [Mk. 14:3-9] that anointed Adoneinu with mishcha"
43,11,3,"Therefore, the achayot"
43,11,4,"And having heard this, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, This machla"
43,11,5,"Now Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had ahavah for Marta, and her achot and El'azar."
43,11,6,"When, therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach heard that El'azar was choleh, then he remained in the place where he was yomayim"
43,11,7,"Then after this Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to his talmidim, Let us go into the land of Yehudah again."
43,11,8,"His talmidim say to him, Rebbe, just now those of the land of Yehudah [Judeans] were seeking to stone you, and you go there again?"
43,11,9,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Are there not Sheneym Asar"
43,11,10,"But if the derech of anyone is a derech baLailah, he stumbles because the Ohr is not in him."
43,11,11,"These things he said.  Then, after this, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, El'azar our chaver haahuv has fallen asleep, but I am setting out to awaken him."
43,11,12,"Therefore, the talmidim said to him, Adoni, if he has fallen asleep, he will be granted refu'ah"
43,11,13,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had spoken about the mavet of El'azar. However, those ones supposed that he was speaking about only sleep."
43,11,14,"Then, therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach told them plainly, El'azar died."
43,11,15,"And I have lev same'ach for your sake, that I was not there, that you may have emunah.  But let us go to him."
43,11,16,"Therefore, T'oma"
43,11,17,"Having arrived, therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach discovered El'azar had already been in the kever"
43,11,18,"Now Beit-Anyah"
43,11,19,"And many of those of Yehudah had come to Marta and Miryam to give them nechamah"
43,11,20,"Therefore, Marta when she heard that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes, met him; but Miryam was sitting shivah in the bais."
43,11,21,"Therefore, Marta said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni, if you were here, achi"
43,11,22,"But even now I have da'as that whatever you ask Hashem, Hashem will give you."
43,11,23,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to her, Achich yakum"
43,11,24,"Marta says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, I have da'as that he will rise in the Techiyas HaMesim on the Yom haAcharon"
43,11,25,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to her, Ani hu the Techiyas haMesim and the Chayyim"
43,11,26,"and everyone living and believing in me, l'Olam never dies. Do you have emunah in this?"
43,11,27,"She says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Ken, Adoni. Ani ma'aminah that you are the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, the Ben HaElohim, Hu Habah into the Olam Hazeh.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH WEEPS"
43,11,28,"And having said this, she withdrew and summoned Miryam her achot, telling her privately, Rabbeinu and Moreinu is here, and summons you."
43,11,29,"And that isha, when she heard, got up quickly and was coming to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
43,11,30,"Now he had not yet had come into the shtetl but was still in the place where Marta met him."
43,11,31,"Therefore, those of Yehudah, the ones sitting shiva with her in the bais and giving her nechamah, when they saw Miryam get up quickly and rush out, followed her, assuming that she is going to the kever"
43,11,32,"Therefore, Miryam, when she came where Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was, and when she saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to Rebbe, Adoni, if you were here, achi"
43,11,33,"Therefore, when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw her weeping and those of Yehudah coming with her and also weeping, he was deeply moved spiritually and was troubled in himself,"
43,11,34,"and said, Where have you laid him? They said to him, Adoni, come and see."
43,11,35,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach wept."
43,11,36,"Therefore, those of Yehudah were saying, Hinei! See how much ahavah he had for him."
43,11,37,"But some of them said, Could not this man, who was able to open the eyes of the ivver, have also prevented this man from becoming niftar?  EL'AZAR BROUGHT TO LIFE BY REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH"
43,11,38,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, therefore, again being deeply moved within himself, comes to the kever"
43,11,39,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says, Lift the stone.  Marta, the achot of the niftar, says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni,  already he smells, for it is now arba'ah yamim"
43,11,40,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to her, Did I not tell you that if you have emunah"
43,11,41,"Therefore, they lifted the stone and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach lifted up his eyes and said, Avi, I thank you that you heard me."
43,11,42,"And I knew that you always hear me, but, because of the multitude standing around, I said it, that they may have emunah"
43,11,43,"And having said these things, with a kol gadol, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach cried out, El'azar, come out!"
43,11,44,"Then the niftar, having been bound feet and hands with the linen cloths of the tachrichim, and with his face covered with a mitznefet"
43,11,45,"Therefore, many of those of Yehudah, the ones having come to Miryam and having seen the things which Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did, put their emunah in him. [Shemot 14:31]"
43,11,46,"But some of them went away to the Perushim and reported to them everything Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did."
43,11,47,"Therefore, the Rashei Hakohanim and the Perushim called a meeting of the Sanhedrin and were saying, What are we doing, for this man is doing many otot"
43,11,48,"If we leave him thus, kol bnei Adam will have emunah"
43,11,49,"But a certain one of them, Caiapha, being Kohen Gadol that year, said to them, You do not have da'as of anything"
43,11,50,"nor do you consider that it is a bedievedike"
43,11,51,"But this he did not utter from himself, but, being Kohen Gadol that year, he uttered a dvar hanevu'ah"
43,11,52,"and not on behalf of Am Yisroel only but also the yeladim of Hashem, the ones having been scattered, that he may gather into echad.[Yeshayah 49:6]"
43,11,53,"From that Yom on, therefore, they planned that they might put him to death."
43,11,54,"Therefore Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach no longer was walking openly among those of Yehudah but went away from there into the region near the wilderness, to a shtetl called Efrayim, and there Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach remained with the talmidim. [Shmuel Bais 13:23]"
43,11,55,"Now Pesach was near and many went up to Yerushalayim from the country before the Pesach for the purpose of hitteharu"
43,11,56,"They were seeking, therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and were saying to one another while they stood in the Beit Hamikdash, What does it appear to you?  Surely he will not come to the Chag"
43,11,57,"Now the Rashei Hakohanim and the Perushim had given orders  that if anyone had da'as of where he is, he should reveal it so that they might arrest him."
43,12,1,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came into Beit-Anyan"
43,12,2,"Then they made Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach a seudah there. And Marta was serving, and El'azar was one of the ones reclining at tish with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
43,12,3,"Then Miryam having taken a pound of mishcha"
43,12,4,"And Yehuda from K'riot, one of the talmidim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, the talmid being about to betray him, says"
43,12,5,"Why was this mishcha not sold for three hundred denarii and given to haAniyim"
43,12,6,"But he said this not because it mattered about haAniyim, but because he was a ganav and he was removing what was put in the aron otzaram"
43,12,7,"Therefore Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Let her alone. She kept this for the Yom haKevurah"
43,12,8,"For haAniyim you have always with you, but you do not always have me. [Devarim 15:11] THE PLOT AGAINST EL'AZAR"
43,12,9,"When the great multitude of the Yehudim had da'as of where  Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was, they came not only because of him but also because of El'azar, that they may see the one whom he made to stand up alive from the mesim."
43,12,10,"But the Rashei Hakohanim took counsel that they also might kill El'azar,"
43,12,11,"because many of the Yehudim were leaving and believing in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach on account of El'azar.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTO YERUSHALAYIM"
43,12,12,"On the next day the great multitude, the one having come to the Chag"
43,12,13,"took the branches of the temarim"
43,12,14,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach found an ayir"
43,12,15,"Do not fear BAT TZIYON, HINEI MALKECH YAVO LACH ROKHEV AL AYIR BEN ATONOT (Do not fear, Daughter of Zion, Look, Your King is coming, siting on a foal of donkeys [Zecharyah 9:9; Yeshayah 35:4; Zefanyah 3:14f Targum Ha-Shivim"
43,12,16,"Regarding these things his talmidim did not have binah"
43,12,17,"So the crowd that had been with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach when he called El'azar out of the kever and made him stand up alive from the mesim were giving solemn edut"
43,12,18,"Therefore, the multitude met Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach because they heard him to have done this ot"
43,12,19,"Therefore the Perushim said to themselves, You see, you can do nothing!  Kol Bnei Adam have gone after him. YEVANIM"
43,12,20,"Now there were some Yevanim among the ones going up to worship at the Chag"
43,12,21,"These ones, therefore, approached Philippos from Beit-Tzaidah of the Galil, and were asking him, Sir, we want to see Yehoshua."
43,12,22,"Philippos comes and tells Andrew and Andrew and Philippos come and tell Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
43,12,23,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answers them, saying, The sha'ah"
43,12,24,"Omein, omein, I say to you, unless the gargeer hakhitah"
43,12,25,"The Ohev of his neshamah will lose it, but the Soneh"
43,12,26,"If anyone serves me, let him follow me, and where I am, there also my eved"
43,12,27,"Now my neshamah"
43,12,28,"Avi, bring kavod to your Name. A kol"
43,12,29,"Therefore, the multitude, that was standing there and heard, said, That was ra'am"
43,12,30,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, Not for my sake has this kol come, but for yours. [Shemot 19:9]"
43,12,31,"Now is the mishpat"
43,12,32,"And if I receive the HAGBA"
43,12,33,"And this Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was saying, signifying by what kind of mavet"
43,12,34,"Then the crowd answered Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, We heard from the Torah that the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach remains l'Olam"
43,12,35,"Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Yet a little time is the Ohr"
43,12,36,"While you have the Ohr"
43,12,37,"Though so many otot"
43,12,38,"that the dvar of Yeshayah the Navi may be fulfilled, which said, Adonoi, MI HE'EMIN LISHMU'ATEINU UZERO'A HASHEM AL-MI NIGLATAH? (Who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of Hashem revealed?--[Yeshayah 53:1]"
43,12,39,"Therefore, they were not able to have emunah, because, again Yeshayah said,"
43,12,40,"`HE HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES, HASHMIN LEV HAAM HAZEH"
43,12,41,"These things Yeshayah spoke because he saw the kavod"
43,12,42,"Nevertheless, however, even among the manhigim"
43,12,43,"For their ahavah was for the kavod anashim rather than the kavod Hashem. [Shmuel Alef 15:30]  JUDGMENT WHEN THE AV BET DIN WILL BE REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH"
43,12,44,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach cried out, The ma'amin in me does not have emunah in me, but in the One having sent me."
43,12,45,"And the one seeing me sees the One having sent me."
43,12,46,"I have come as an Ohr"
43,12,47,"And if anyone hears my dvarim and of my dvarim is not shomer, I do not judge him, for I did not come to bring the Olam Hazeh into mishpat, but that I may save the Olam Hazeh."
43,12,48,"The one setting me aside and not receiving the dvarim has his Shofet: the dvar which I spoke will judge him on the Yom HaAcharon [i.e. the Yom HaDin]."
43,12,49,"Because I do not speak on my own, but the one having sent me--HaAv--he has given me a mitzvoh of what I may say and what I may speak."
43,12,50,"And I have da'as that the mitzvoh of him is Chayyei Olam. Whatsoever things I speak, I speak, therefore, just as HaAv has told me."
43,13,1,"Now before the Chag"
43,13,2,"And seudah taking place, Hasatan already having put into the lev of Yehudah Ben Shimon from K'riot that he should betray him,"
43,13,3,"and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach having had da'as that HaAv had given into his hands all things, and that from Hashem Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came forth and to Hashem he is going,"
43,13,4,"he rises from the seudah and put aside his kaftan and having girded himself with a towel,"
43,13,5,"he puts mayim"
43,13,6,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes then to Shimon Kefa. Kefa says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni, you wash my feet?"
43,13,7,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, What I am doing you do not have da'as of now, but you will receive binah after these things."
43,13,8,"Kefa says to him, Never will you wash my feet l'Olam! Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered him, Unless I wash you you do not have a chelek [alloted portion of inheritance] with me. [Devarim 12:12]"
43,13,9,"Shimon Kefa says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni, then not my feet only but also my hands and my head."
43,13,10,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, The one having been bathed does not have need except his feet to wash, but is wholly tahor, and you are tehorim, though not all."
43,13,11,"For Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach had da'as of the one betraying him.  Therefore, he said, Not all are tehorim."
43,13,12,"Therefore, when he washed their feet and resuited himself into his kaftan, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach reclined at tish again and said to them, Do you have da'as of what I have done for you?"
43,13,13,"You call me Rebbe and Adoneinu, and you say well, for Ani hu."
43,13,14,"If, therefore, I, being Rebbe and Adon, washed your feet, you ought to wash the feet of one another also."
43,13,15,"For I gave you a mofet that as I did to you, you may do also."
43,13,16,"Omein, omein, I say to you, an eved is not greater than his Adon, nor is a shliach"
43,13,17,"If you have da'as of these things, happy are you, if you put them into practice."
43,13,18,"I do not speak about all of you."
43,13,19,"From now on I tell you before the occurrence that you may have emunah"
43,13,20,"Omein, omein, I say to you, the one receiving whomever I may send receives me, and the one receiving me, receives the One having sent me.  THE NAMING OF THE BETRAYER AND MALSHIN"
43,13,21,"Having said these things, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was spiritually troubled and he gave solemn edut"
43,13,22,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's talmidim were looking at one another, being uncertain about whom he speaks."
43,13,23,"One of his talmidim was reclining at tish near the kheyk"
43,13,24,"Therefore Shimon Kefa nods to this one to inquire who it may be about whom Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach speaks."
43,13,25,"Having leaned back, then, that one thus near the chest of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, says to him, Adoni, who is it?"
43,13,26,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answers, That one it is to whom I will dip the [maror into the charoset] morsel and will give to him. Having dipped, therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach takes the  [maror-charoset-matzah] morsel and gives to Yehudah Ben Shimon from K'riot."
43,13,27,"And after he received the [maror-charoset-matzah] morsel, then Hasatan entered into that man; therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, What you are bent on doing, do quickly."
43,13,28,"But no one reclining at tish had da'as of why he said this to him."
43,13,29,"For some were thinking vi-bahlt"
43,13,30,"Therefore, having taken the morsel, that man went out immediately.  And it was lailah"
43,13,31,"When, therefore that man went out, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says, Now the Ben HaAdam [Daniel 7:13-4] receives kavod and Hashem is given kavod in Him."
43,13,32,"If Hashem receives kavod in Him, Hashem will also give him kavod in Himself, and Hashem will give Him kavod immediately."
43,13,33,"Yeladim, yet a little while I am immanu"
43,13,34,"A mitzvah chadasha I give to you, that you have ahavah"
43,13,35,"By this will kol Bnei Adam have da'as that my talmidim you are, if ahavah"
43,13,36,"Shimon Kefa says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni,  where are you going? In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered him, Where I go, you are not able now to follow me, but you will follow later."
43,13,37,"Kefa says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni, why am I not able to follow you now? I will lay down my neshamah for you."
43,13,38,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answers, Your neshamah for me will you lay down? Omein, omein, I say to you, a tarnegol will not crow until you make hakhchashah"
43,14,1,"Let not you levavot be troubled [14:27].  You have emunah"
43,14,2,"In the Beit Avi there are many me'onot"
43,14,3,"And if I go and prepare a makom for you, I am coming again and will receive you to myself that where I am there you may be also."
43,14,4,"And where I go you have da'as of HaDerech. [Tehillim 1:6]"
43,14,5,"T'oma says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni, we do not have da'as of where you are going; how are we able to have da'as of HaDerech?"
43,14,6,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, I am HaDerech, HaEmes, and HaChayyim. No one comes to HaAv except through me.  PHILIPPOS, HOW CAN YOU BE SO SHVACH"
43,14,7,"If you have had da'as of me, also you will have had da'as of Avi.  And from now on, you have had da'as of Him and have seen Him.  A PIDYON NEFESH"
43,14,8,"Philippos says to him, Adoni, show us [Elohim] HaAv and it is enough for us."
43,14,9,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to Philippos, So long a time with you I am and you have not had da'as of me, Philippos? The one having seen me has seen [Elohim] HaAv [Col.1:15; Yeshayah 9:5"
43,14,10,"Do you not have emunah"
43,14,11,"In me have emunah, that Ani hu in HaAv and HaAv is in me;  but if not, have emunah because of the pe'ulot themselves."
43,14,12,"Omein, omein, I say to you, the one believing in me the pe'ulot which I do he will do, and gedolot than these will he do, because I am going to HaAv."
43,14,13,"And whatever you ask b'Shem of me I will do, that HaAv may receive kavod in HaBen."
43,14,14,"If anything you ask me b'Shem of me, I will do it. THE HAVTACHAH"
43,14,15,"If you have ahavah for me, you will be shomer mitzvot regarding my commandments. [Tehillim 103:18]"
43,14,16,"And I will ask HaAv and another Melitz Yosher [Advocate, Counsellor, Helper in Court, 14:26; 15:26; 16:7; I Yochanan 2:1] he will give you that He may be with you l'Olam,"
43,14,17,"the Ruach HaEmes, which the Olam Hazeh is not able to receive, because it does not see Him nor have da'as of Him.  But you have da'as of Him, because He remains with you and He will be in you."
43,14,18,"I will not leave you yetomah"
43,14,19,"Yet a little time and the Olam Hazeh no longer sees me, but you see me. Because Ani Chai, so you will live also."
43,14,20,"On Yom Hahu"
43,14,21,"The one having the mitzvot of me and being shomer mitzvot, that one is the one having ahavah for me.  And the one having ahavah for me will receive ahavah from HaAv of me, and I will have ahavah for him and I will manifest myself to him."
43,14,22,"Yehudah"
43,14,23,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach  said to him, If anyone has ahavah for me, of my dvar he will be shomer and HaAv of me will have ahavah"
43,14,24,"The one not having ahavah"
43,14,25,"These things I have told you while abiding with you."
43,14,26,"But the Melitz Yosher"
43,14,27,"Shalom Hashem I leave with you, my Shalom I give to you, [Bamidbar 6:26; Tehillim 85:8; Malachi 2:6] not as the Olam Hazeh gives, I give to you; let not your levavot be troubled [14:1] nor let them be ones of morech lev"
43,14,28,"You heard me say to you, I am going [14:12], and I am coming to you [14:18]. If you were having ahavah for me you would have simcha, because I go to HaAv, for HaAv is greater than me [Yochanan 1:1,14]."
43,14,29,"And now I have told you before it happens, that when it happens, you may have emunah"
43,14,30,"No longer many things I will speak with you, for the Sar HaOlam Hazeh is coming; and in me he does not have anything."
43,14,31,"But in order that HaOlam may have da'as that I have ahavah for HaAv, as HaAv gave me mitzvoh, so I do.  Arise, let us go from here."
43,15,1,"I am HaGefen HaAmitit"
43,15,2,"Every sarig"
43,15,3,"You are already metoharim"
43,15,4,"Remain in me and I in you.  As the sarig is not able to bear p'ri from itself, unless it remans on the gefen"
43,15,5,"Ani Hu"
43,15,6,"Unless someone remains in me, he is cast out as the sarig and is dried up and they gather them, and into the Aish they throw them, and they are burned. [Yechezkel 15:1-8; 19:10]"
43,15,7,"If you remain in me and the dvarim of me remain in you, whatever you want, ask, and it will be done for you!"
43,15,8,"By this HaAv of me was given kavod, that much p'ri you bear, and so be my talmidim."
43,15,9,"As HaAv has ahavah for me, so I have ahavah for you.  Remain in my ahavah."
43,15,10,"If you are shomer of my mitzvot, you will remain in my ahavah, as I of the mitzvot of HaAv of me have been shomer, and I remain in His Ahavah."
43,15,11,"These things I have spoken to you that the simcha of me may be in you and the simcha of you may be made shleimah."
43,15,12,"This is my mitzvah for you, that you have ahavah"
43,15,13,"Ahavah"
43,15,14,"You are my chaverim if you are shomer for my mitzvot. [Iyov 16:20; Mishle 18:24]"
43,15,15,"No longer do I call you avadim because the eved does not have da'as of what his Adon is doing, but you I have called chaverim, because all things which I heard from HaAv of me, of all these things I gave you da'as. [Shemot 33:11]"
43,15,16,"It was not that you chose me, but I chose you, and have  given you s'michah that you go and bear p'ri and the p'ri of you remain, that whatever you ask HaAv b'Shem of me"
43,15,17,"I am giving you these mitzvot, that you have ahavah"
43,15,18,"If the Olam Hazeh has sin'as chinom"
43,15,19,"If you were of the Olam Hazeh, the Olam Hazeh would have had ahavah for its own.  But because from the Olam Hazeh you are not, but I chose you out of the Olam Hazeh, therefore the Olam Hazeh has sin'as chinom for you."
43,15,20,"Put in zikaron"
43,15,21,"But all these things they will do to you on account of the Shem of me [Yeshayah 66:5], because they do not have da'as of the One having sent me."
43,15,22,"If I did not come and speak to them, [Yechezkel 2:5] they would not have chet; but now they have no ptur"
43,15,23,"The one having sin'as chinom"
43,15,24,"If I did not do pe'ulot among them which no other man did, they would not have chet, but now they have beheld and they have had sin'as chinom for both me and HaAv of me."
43,15,25,"But this was that the dvar having been written in their Torah might be fulfilled, SONE'AI CHINOM ATZMU"
43,15,26,"But when the Melitz Yosher"
43,15,27,"And you [Shluchim] will give solemn edut"
43,16,1,"I have spoken these things to you that no cause of michshol"
43,16,2,"They will put you under the cherem ban in the shuls; a sha'ah"
43,16,3,"And these things they will do because they did not have da'as of HaAv or of me."
43,16,4,"But these things I have spoken to you, that, when the sha'ah"
43,16,5,"But now I am going to the One who sent me.  And none of you asks me, Where are you going?"
43,16,6,"But because I have spoken these things to you, agmat nefesh"
43,16,7,"But I tell HaEmes"
43,16,8,"And having come, that one will expose and convict [in court] the Olam Hazeh concerning Chet and concerning Tzedek and concerning Mishpat:"
43,16,9,"concerning Chet"
43,16,10,"concerning Tzedek [Daniel 9:25] because I go to HaAv and no longer do you see me;"
43,16,11,"and concerning Mishpat"
43,16,12,"Yet many things I have to tell you but you are not able to bear them now."
43,16,13,"But when that One has come, the Ruach Hakodesh, the Ruach HaEmes, He will guide you in all truth. [Tehillim 25:5] For He will not speak on His own, but what things He will hear, He will speak, and the things that are to come He will announce to you."
43,16,14,"That One will give kavod to me, because He will receive of what is mine, and will announce it to you."
43,16,15,"All things which HaAv has are mine; therefore, I said that of mine He receives and will announce it to you. AGMAT NEFESH WILL TURN TO SIMCHA"
43,16,16,"A little time and you no longer see me.  And again a little time, and you will see me."
43,16,17,"Therefore, some of the talmidim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to one another, What is this which he says to us?  `A little time and you do not see me.' And `Again a little time and you will see me'?  And `Because I go to HaAv'?"
43,16,18,"Therefore, they were saying, What is this, which he says, `A little time'?  We do not have da'as of what he says."
43,16,19,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach knew that they were wanting to ask him. And he said to them, About this you inquire of one another that I said, `A litle time and you do not see me. And again a little time and you will see me'?"
43,16,20,"Omein, omein, I say to you, that there will be bechi"
43,16,21,"The isha"
43,16,22,"Therefore, you have agmat nefesh"
43,16,23,"And on that day you will not ask me anything. Omein, omein, I say to you, whatever you ask HaAv b'Shem of me, He will give it to you."
43,16,24,"Until now you did not ask anything b'Shem of me.  Ask and you will receive that the simcha of you may be shleimah. REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH HAS CONQUERED THE OLAM HAZEH"
43,16,25,"Regarding these things I have spoken figuratively. [Tehillim 78:2; Yechezkel 20:49] A sha'ah comes when no longer I will speak figuratively to you, but will announce plainly to you concerning HaAv."
43,16,26,"On that day b'Shem of me you will ask, and I do not say to you that I will ask HaAv concerning you."
43,16,27,"For HaAv Himself has ahavah for you, because you have ahavah for me and have emunah that I came forth from HaAv."
43,16,28,"I came from HaAv and I have come into the Olam Hazeh.  Again I leave the Olam Hazeh and go to HaAv."
43,16,29,"The talmidim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach say, Hinei! See now you speak plainly and no longer figuratively do you speak."
43,16,30,"Now we have da'as that you have da'as of all things, and you have no need that any test you with any sh'eilah"
43,16,31,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered them, Do you have emunah?"
43,16,32,"Hinei! A sha'ah"
43,16,33,"These things I have spoken to you that in me you may have shalom.  In the Olam Hazeh you have tribulation; but have lev same'ach.  I have conquered the Olam Hazeh."
43,17,1,"These things said Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. And having lifted up his eyes to Shomayim, said, Avi, the sha'ah"
43,17,2,"vi-bahlt"
43,17,3,"And this is Chayyei Olam, that they may have da'as of the only Elohei HaEmes"
43,17,4,"I have given you kavod on ha'aretz, having completed the melakhah"
43,17,5,"And now You give me kavod, Avi, along with Yourself with the kavod which I was having with You before HaOlam came to be [Yochanan 1:1-3]."
43,17,6,"I manifested the Shem of You to the bnei Adam whom you gave me out of the Olam Hazeh. They were Yours and to me You gave them and regarding the dvar of You they have been shomer."
43,17,7,"Now they have da'as that all things whatsoever You have given to me are from You."
43,17,8,"Because the dvarim which You gave me, of these I have been shomer, and they received them, and they have da'as b'emes that from You I came forth, and they have emunah that You sent me."
43,17,9,"I make bakash"
43,17,10,"And all things that are mine are Yours, and Your things are mine, and I have been given kavod in them."
43,17,11,"And I am no longer in the Olam Hazeh, and they are in the Olam Hazeh, and I am coming to You, Avi HaKadosh.  Guard them in the Shem of You, which You have given me, that they may be Echad as we are Echad. [Tehillim 133:1; Devarim 6:4]"
43,17,12,"When I was with them, I was keeping them in the Shem of You, which you have given me, and I kept watch, and none of them perished or was lost, except the Ben HaAvaddon"
43,17,13,"And now to you I am coming, and I speak these things in the Olam Hazeh that they may have my simcha made shleimah in themselves."
43,17,14,"I have given to them the dvar of You and the Olam Hazeh has had sin'as chinom"
43,17,15,"I do not make bakash"
43,17,16,"They are not of the Olam Hazeh, just as I am not of the Olam Hazeh."
43,17,17,"Set them apart for a use that is kadosh in HaEmes"
43,17,18,"As You sent me into the Olam Hazeh, so also I send them into the Olam Hazeh. [Tehillim 119:142, 160]"
43,17,19,"And for their sake, I set myself apart as kadosh that they also may be set apart for use that is kadosh in HaEmes."
43,17,20,"However, I do not make bakash"
43,17,21,"That all may be echad, as you, Avi, are in me and I am in You, [Yirmeyah 32:39] that also they may be in us, that the Olam Hazeh may have emunah"
43,17,22,"The kavod which You have given me, I have given them, that they may be echad just as we are echad."
43,17,23,"I in them and You in me that they may become tamim"
43,17,24,"Elohim Avi, as to that which You have given me, I desire that where I am, those also may be with me, that they may behold my Kavod, which You have given me, because You had ahavah for me before the hivvased haOlam"
43,17,25,"Avi haTzaddik, indeed the world did not have da'as of You, but I knew You, and these ones knew that You sent me."
43,17,26,"And I have made known to them the Shem of You and will make it known, that the ahavah with which you loved me may be in them and I in them."
43,18,1,"These things having said, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach went out with his talmidim across the Kidron Valley, [Shmuel Bais 15:23] where there was a Gahn"
43,18,2,"Now also Yehudah from K'riot, the one betraying Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, had da'as of the place, because often Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gathered there with his talmidim."
43,18,3,"Then, Yehudah from K'riot, having taken the band of chaiyalim"
43,18,4,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, therefore, having had da'as of everything coming upon him, went out and says to them, Whom do you seek?"
43,18,5,"They said in reply, Yehoshua, the one from Natzeret. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Ani Hu. Now also Yehudah, the one betraying him, had stood with them."
43,18,6,"When therefore Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach told them, Ani Hu, they recoiled and fell to the ground."
43,18,7,"Therefore, again Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach questioned them, Whom do you seek?  And they said, Yehoshua, the one from Natzeret."
43,18,8,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, I told you that Ani Hu. If therefore you seek me, let these bnei Adam go away,"
43,18,9,"that may be fulfilled the dvar which said, `Those whom you have given me, I did not lose any one of them.' [Yochanan 17:12; 10:11]"
43,18,10,"Then Shimon Kefa, having a cherev"
43,18,11,"Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to Kefa, Put the cherev"
43,18,12,"Then the band of chaiyalim, their commander, and the avadim"
43,18,13,"First they led Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to Anan"
43,18,14,"Now Caiapha was the one having given counsel to those of Yehudah that it is a bedievedike thing"
43,18,15,"Now Shimon Kefa and another talmid were following Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  And that other talmid was known to the Kohen Gadol, and that other talmid entered with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach into the court of the Kohen Gadol."
43,18,16,"But Kefa had stood at the sha'ar outside.  Therefore, the other talmid went out, the one known to the Kohen Gadol, and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought in Kefa."
43,18,17,"Therefore, the maid says to Kefa, Surely you are not also of this man's talmidim?  He said, I am not."
43,18,18,"And the avadim and the mesharetim had made a hadlakah"
43,18,19,"Then the Kohen Gadol interrogated Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach about his talmidim and his torah"
43,18,20,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said,  In public I have spoken to the Olam Hazeh; I always taught in the Beit Haknesset and in the Beis Hamikdash, where all the Yehudim come together.  In secret I spoke nothing. [Yeshayah 45:19]"
43,18,21,"Why do you put a sh'eilah"
43,18,22,"But these things having said, one of the mesharetim, one standing nearby, struck Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, saying, Is this the way to answer the Kohen Gadol? [Shemot 22:27]"
43,18,23,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach spoke, If I spoke wrongly, give edut"
43,18,24,"Then Anan sent Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, still in the akedah, to Caiapha the Kohen Gadol.  KEFA DENIES REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AGAIN"
43,18,25,"Now with Shimon Kefa still standing and warming himself,  they said, therefore, to him, Surely you are not also of the his talmidim, are you? In reply, he said, I am not."
43,18,26,"One of the avadim of the Kohen Gadol, one who was a relative of him whom Kefa cut off the ear, says, Did I not see you in the Gahn"
43,18,27,"Therefore, again Kefa made hakhchashah"
43,18,28,"Therefore, they led Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach from Caiapha to the Praetorium. And it was early. They themselves did not enter into the Praetorium so as not to become tema'im"
43,18,29,"Pilate went forth outside to them and says, What sitnah"
43,18,30,"In reply, they said to him, If this man were not an evil-doer, we would not have handed him over to you."
43,18,31,"Therefore, Pilate said to them, Take him and judge him according to the your Torah.  Those of Yehudah said to him, It is not lawful for us to kill anyone."
43,18,32,""
43,18,33,"Therefore, Pilate again entered into the Praetorium and called Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and said to him, Are you HaMelech HaYehudim?"
43,18,34,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach asked,  From yourself you say this? Or another told you about me?"
43,18,35,"In reply, Pilate said, Am I a Yehudi? Your nation and your Kohen Gadol handed you over to me.  What did you do?"
43,18,36,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, My Malchut is not of the Olam Hazeh. If my Malchut were of the Olam Hazeh, my mesharetim would have fought, that I should not be delivered to those of Yehudah; but now my Malchut is not from here."
43,18,37,"Therefore, Pilate said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, So you are a Melech"
43,18,38,"Pilate says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, What is HaEmes?  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH SENTENCED TO DIE BUT BAR-ABBA IS RELEASED"
43,18,39,"But there is a minhag"
43,18,40,"Therefore, they cried out again, saying, Not this man but Bar-Abba.  Now Bar-Abba was a shoded"
43,19,1,"Therefore, then, Pilate took Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and had him scourged. [Devarim 25:3; Yeshayah 50:6; 53:5]"
43,19,2,"And the [Roman] chaiyalim"
43,19,3,"And they were coming up to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and they were saying, Hail! You Melech HaYehudim! And they were repeatedly striking him in the face."
43,19,4,"And Pilate went outside again and says to them, Hinei! I bring him outside to you, in order that you may have da'as that I find no avon"
43,19,5,"Therefore, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came forth outside, wearing the wreath of thorns and the purple robe.  And Pilate says to them, Hinei! haIsh!"
43,19,6,"Therefore, when the Rashei Hakohanim and the mesharetim saw Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, they cried out, saying, Hang him on haAitz! Hang him on haAitz!  Pilate says to them, You take him and you hang him on haAitz! I find no avon in him. [Devarim 21:22]"
43,19,7,"In reply, those of Yehudah said, We have a Torah and, according to the Torah, he must die [Vayikra 24:16], because he made himself to be the Ben HaElohim."
43,19,8,"Therefore, when Pilate heard this dvar he was afraid even more."
43,19,9,"And Pilate entered into the Praetorium again and says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, From where are you? But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not give an answer"
43,19,10,"Therefore, Pilate says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, To me you do not speak? Do you not have da'as that I have samchut"
43,19,11,"In reply, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach answered him, You do not have samchut"
43,19,12,"From this point, Pilate began seeking to free Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach; but those of Yehudah cried out, saying, If this man you free, you are no friend of Caesar's; everyone making himself a Melech speaks against Caesar."
43,19,13,"Therefore, Pilate, having heard these dvarim, led Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach out, and Pilate sat down upon a tribunal"
43,19,14,"Now it was Erev Pesach, the sha'ah"
43,19,15,"Therefore, these cried out, Away, away, hang him on haAitz! Pilate says to them, Shall I hang on haAitz your Melech? In reply, the Kohen Gadol said, We do not have a Melech except Caesar."
43,19,16,"Then, therefore, Pilate delivered Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to them that he should be hanged on HaAitz. [Devarim 21:22] THE HAGBA"
43,19,17,"And carrying by himself the Aitz"
43,19,18,"There they hanged Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach on HaAitz and with him shenayim"
43,19,19,"And, also, Pilate wrote out an inscription and had it placarded on top of the Aitz"
43,19,20,"This inscription, therefore, many of those of Yehudah read, because the place where Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was hanged on the Aitz was near the Ir Hakodesh.  And it had been written in Ivrit, in Latin, and in Greek."
43,19,21,"Therefore, the Judean Rashei Hakohanim were saying to Pilate, Do not write Melech HaYehudim.  Rather write, That one said I am Melech HaYehudim."
43,19,22,"In reply, Pilate said, What I have written, I have written."
43,19,23,"Therefore the chaiyalim"
43,19,24,"Therefore, they said to one another, Let us not tear it but let us cast lots for it"
43,19,25,"But there had stood beside the Aitz"
43,19,26,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, therefore, having seen his Em"
43,19,27,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to the talmid haahuv, Hinei, Emmecha"
43,19,28,"After this, having had da'as that already everything has become shleimah, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, that the Kitvei Hakodesh may be fulfilled, says, Ani tzameh"
43,19,29,"A k'li"
43,19,30,"Therefore, when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach received the vinegar, he said, Nishlam!"
43,19,31,"Therefore, those of Yehudah, vi-bahlt"
43,19,32,"Therefore the chaiyalim"
43,19,33,"But having come to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, when they saw that he was already niftar"
43,19,34,"But one of the chaiyalim pierced [Zecharyah 12:10] his side with a romakh and immediately out came dahm and mayim."
43,19,35,"And the ed re'iyah"
43,19,36,"For these things happened that the Kitvei Hakodesh [19:24, 28,37] might be fulfilled, V'ETZEM LO TISHVERU VO"
43,19,37,"And again the Kitvei Hakodesh says, V'HIBITU ELAV ES ASHER DAKARU"
43,19,38,"Now after these things, Yosef from Ramatayim, being a talmid of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, but besod"
43,19,39,"And also Rav Nakdimon came, the one having come first to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach balailah, bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred pounds."
43,19,40,"Therefore, they took the Guf haRebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and bound it in linen cloths with spices as is the burial minhag with the Yehudim."
43,19,41,"Now there was in the place where Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was pierced on haAitz a gahn"
43,19,42,"And so, because it was Erev Pesach and because the kever was nearby, they laid Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach there."
43,20,1,"Now on the Yom Rishon, Miryam of Magdala comes early, while it was still dark, to the kever"
43,20,2,"Miryam of Magdala runs therefore and comes to Shimon Kefa and to the talmid ha'ahuv and says to them, They have taken Adoneinu from the kever"
43,20,3,"Therefore, Shimon Kefa went forth and the other talmid, and they were coming to the kever"
43,20,4,"and were running, the two together and the other talmid ran ahead faster than Kefa, and came first to the kever"
43,20,5,"and having stooped down, the talmid ha'ahuv sees the tachrichim linen cloths lying there. However, he did not enter the kever.  SHIMON KEFA IS THE FIRST ED RE'IYAH"
43,20,6,"Then comes also Shimon Kefa following him and Shimon Kefa entered into the kever"
43,20,7,"And also the mitznefet"
43,20,8,"Then, therefore, entered also the other talmid, the one having come first to the kever"
43,20,9,"For they did not yet have da'as of the Kitvei Hakodesh that it is necessary for Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to have his Techiyas HaMesim [Tehillim 16:9; Yeshayah 53:10]"
43,20,10,"Then the talmidim went away again to their own homes.  THE APPEARANCE OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH TO MIRYAM OF MAGDALA:   HAYITOCHEN"
43,20,11,"Now Miryam had stood at the kever"
43,20,12,"and sees two malachim"
43,20,13,"And those ones say to her, Isha, why do you weep?  She says to them, They took Adoni, and I don't have da'as of where they placed him."
43,20,14,"When she had said these things, she turned back around, and she sees Yehoshua standing there, and she did not have da'as that it was Yehoshua."
43,20,15,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to her, Isha, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? Miryam, supposing that he was the shomer hagahn"
43,20,16,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to her, Miryam. She turns and she says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach in Ivrit, Rabboni."
43,20,17,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to her, Stop touching me, for I have not yet made the aliyah ascent to HaAv; but go to my achim and tell them, I make the aliyah ascent to Avi"
43,20,18,"Miryam from Magdala comes announcing to the talmidim, I have seen Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu. And she told them that he had said to her these things.  THE APPEARANCE OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH TO HIS TALMIDIM"
43,20,19,"On that Yom Rishon, when it was erev, and the delatot"
43,20,20,"And having said this, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach showed his hands and his side to them. Therefore, the talmidim were filled with simcha at having seen Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu."
43,20,21,"Therefore Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them again, Shalom Aleichem! As HaAv has sent me, so also I send you. [Bereshis 2:7; Yechezkel 37:9]"
43,20,22,"And having said, Moshiach breathed on them and says to them, Receive the Ruach Hakodesh.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S SHLUCHIM AND THE POWER VESTED IN THEM BY HIM TO ESTABLISH AND DISCIPLINE HIS KEHILLAH"
43,20,23,"If you grant selicha to the averos of any, they have selicha; if there be any whose averos you retain, they are retained. [Mt.16:19; 18:18; Acts 8:17-24]      REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND T'OMA"
43,20,24,"But T'oma, one of the Sheneym Asar"
43,20,25,"Therefore the other talmidim were saying to him, Ra'i'nu es Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu"
43,20,26,"And after shmonah yamim"
43,20,27,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to T'oma, Bring your finger here and see my hands, and bring your hand and put it into my side, and do not be without emunah but be a ma'amin"
43,20,28,"In reply, T'oma said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni and Elohai! [Tehillim 35:23]"
43,20,29,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, Because you have seen me, you have emunah"
43,20,30,"Therefore, many other otot"
43,20,31,"But these things have been written that you might have emunah that Yehoshua is the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, the Ben HaElohim, and that, believing, you may have Chayyim"
43,21,1,"After these things Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach manifested himself again to his talmidim at Lake Tiberias. Now Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was manifested thus."
43,21,2,"Together there were Shimon Kefa and T'oma"
43,21,3,"Shimon Kefa says to them, I am going to fish.  They say to Shimon Kefa, We are coming also with you.  They went forth and embarked into the sirah"
43,21,4,"Now early morning already having come, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach stood on the shore. The talmidim had not, however, realized it was he."
43,21,5,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says, therefore, to them, Yeladim, surely not any dagim"
43,21,6,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, Throw the reshet"
43,21,7,"Therefore, the talmid ha'ahuv says to Shimon Kefa, It is Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu!  Therefore, Shimon Kefa, having heard this, strapped his gartel around his kaftan, for he was unclothed, and threw himself into the sea."
43,21,8,"But the other talmidim in the sirah"
43,21,9,"Therefore, when the talmidim disembarked onto the shore, they see a hadlakah"
43,21,10,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Bring from the dagim which you caught now."
43,21,11,"Therefore, Shimon Kefa went up and dragged the reshet"
43,21,12,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Come, eat!  Now not one of the talmidim was daring to ask him, Who are you? having had da'as that it is Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu."
43,21,13,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes and takes the lechem and gives to them, likewise the dagim."
43,21,14,"This was now the shlishit"
43,21,15,"Then when they ate, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to Shimon Kefa, Shimon Ben Yochanan, do you have ahavah for me more than these?  Shimon Kefa says to him, Ken, Adoni, you have da'as that I have ahavah for you. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, Feed my lambs."
43,21,16,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach again a second time says to him, Shimon Ben Yochanan, do you have ahavah for me?  Shimon Kefa says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Ken, Adoni, you have da'as that I have ahavah for you. Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, Take care [as a ro'eh"
43,21,17,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, the shlishit time, Shimon Ben Yochanan, do you have ahavah for me?  Kefa was grieved because Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him the shlishit time, Do you have ahavah for me? and he says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni, you have da'as of all things. You have da'as that I have ahavah for you.  Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, Feed my kevasim."
43,21,18,"Omein, omein, I say to you, then when you were young, you were girding yourself and were walking where you wanted, but when you grow old you will extend your hands and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go."
43,21,19,"And this Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said signifying by what mavet Shimon Kefa will glorify Hashem.  After this, he said to him, Follow me.     REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND THE TALMID HA'AHUV"
43,21,20,"Having turned, Kefa sees the talmid ha'ahuv following them,  who also was reclining at tish during the seudah upon the kheyk"
43,21,21,"Then Kefa, having seen this one, says to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Adoni, and what about this man?"
43,21,22,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to him, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?  You follow me."
43,21,23,"Therefore, a dvar of rumor went out saying to the achim that that talmid would not die.  But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not tell him that he would not die, but rather, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?"
43,21,24,"This is the talmid, the ones giving solemn edut"
43,21,25,"And there are many other things which Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did, which if they are written one by one, not the Olam Hazeh itself I suppose would have room enough for the sfarim being written."
44,1,1,"In the sefer harishon I wrote about everything, O Theophilus, about Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua both what he began to do and the shiurim he began to give,"
44,1,2,"until HaYom, when he made aliyah ascent to Shomayim, having given Moshiach's mitzvot through the Ruach HaKodesh to the  Shluchim whom he chose,"
44,1,3,"to whom also he presented himself chai, after his Messianic innuyim, by many convincing proofs, during arba'im yamim appearing to his Shluchim and speaking concerning the Malchut Hashem."
44,1,4,"And while gathering them at a yechidus, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave instructions to them not to depart from Yerushalayim, but to wait for the havtachah of HaAv which he said, You heard of from me. [Tehillim 27:14]"
44,1,5,"For Yochanan gave a tevilah of teshuvah with a mikveh mayim, but you will receive a tevilah in the Ruach HaKodesh not many yamim from now. MOSHIACH'S ALIYAH ASCENT TO SHOMAYIM"
44,1,6,"And at yechidus, having come together, they were asking him saying, Adoneinu, is it at this time that you are restoring the Malchut Hashem to Am Yisroel?"
44,1,7,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, It is not for you to have da'as of the itim"
44,1,8,"But you will receive ko'ach when the Ruach HaKodesh has come upon you, and you all will be HaEd"
44,1,9,"And having said these things, while they were looking on, in an aliyah ascent to Shomayim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was taken up, and an anan"
44,1,10,"And as they were gazing intently into Shomayim, while he was going--hinei--two beings enrobed in white had been present with them."
44,1,11,"Also, these said, Men of the Galil, why do you stand looking into Shomayim? This Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, the one having been taken up from you into Shomayim, will also come again in like manner as you saw him going into Shomayim.      THE CHOICE OF SUCCESSOR FOR YEHUDAH FROM K'RIOT"
44,1,12,"Then they returned to Yerushalayim from the Mount of Olives, which from Yerushalayim is a Shabbos walk."
44,1,13,"And when they entered, they went up into the upstairs where they were staying, that is, Kefa and Yochanan and Ya'akov and Andrew and Philippos and T'oma and Bar-Talmai and Mattityahu and Ya'akov Ben-Chalfai and Shimon the Zealot and Yehudah Ben Ya'akov."
44,1,14,"These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to tefillah, with the nashim and with Miryam the em"
44,1,15,"And at this time, having stood up, Kefa, in the midst of the achim b'Moshiach, [there were 120 persons in the place]"
44,1,16,"said, Achim b'Moshiach, the Kitvei HaKodesh had to be fulfilled, which the Ruach Hakodesh foretold through the peh of Dovid Hamelech concerning Yehudah, who became a guide to the ones arresting Yehoshua."
44,1,17,"For he had been numbered among us, and he received his ministry in the avodas Kodesh of the Moshiach's Shluchim."
44,1,18,"(Now this man therefore acquired a sadeh out of the sachar [reward] of his peysha and, having fallen headlong, he plotst [burst] open in the middle and all the inward parts of him were poured out."
44,1,19,"And this became known to all the ones inhabiting Yerushalayim, so that the sadeh [field] became known in their language as `Akeldama', that is `Sadeh of Dahm.')"
44,1,20,"For it has been written in the sefer Tehillim, TEHI the place of him NESHAMMAH, V'AL YEHI YOSHEV"
44,1,21,"It is necessary, therefore, that one of the anashim who accompanied us during all the time in which Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua went in and went out among us,"
44,1,22,"beginning from  the tevilah of teshuva of Yochanan until the day when Moshiach was taken up from us--one of these should become an Ed"
44,1,23,"And they put forward two anashim, Yosef Bar-Sabba, also called Justus, and Mattityahu."
44,1,24,"And having davened, they said, Adonoi, you have da'as of the levavot of Kol B'nei Adam. Therefore, show which of these two you chose [Shmuel Alef 14:41]"
44,1,25,"to take the place of this avodas Kodesh and shlichut from which Yehudah turned aside to go to his own place."
44,1,26,"And they drew lots, and the lot fell to Mattityahu and he was numbered with the Achad Asar of Moshiach's Shluchim."
44,2,1,"And when the day of Shavuos is fulfilled, they were all together at the same place. [Vayikra 23:15,16]"
44,2,2,"And there was mitamuhl"
44,2,3,"And leshonot appeared to them, being divided as aish"
44,2,4,"and all were filled with the Ruach HaKodesh, and they began to speak in other leshonot as the Ruach HaKodesh was giving the ability to them to speak."
44,2,5,"Now there were in Yerushalayim frum, Charedi Yehudim from all the nations under Shomayim."
44,2,6,"And at this sound, the multitude assembled and was bewildered, because they were hearing, each one in his own native language, the Achim b'Moshiach speaking."
44,2,7,"And they were mishpoyel"
44,2,8,"And how are we hearing, each in our own language in which we were born"
44,2,9,"--we Parthians and Medes and Elamites; the ones living in Mesopotamia, Yehudah, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,"
44,2,10,"Phrygia, Pamphylia, Mitzrayim"
44,2,11,"both Yehudim and Gerim"
44,2,12,"And all had real hispailus"
44,2,13,"But others, mocking, were saying, Of sweet wine they have been filled. SHIMON KEFA'S DRASHAH AT SHAVUOS; THE MOSHIACH'S SHLIACH WAS MOIDIA"
44,2,14,"But Kefa, having stood with the Achad Asar, lifted up his voice and declared to them, Anashim Yehudim! And the ones inhabiting Yerushalayim, have da'as of all this and be goires to my dvarim."
44,2,15,"For these ones are not, as you assume, in their schnaps, for it is only the third hour of the day"

44,2,33,"Having been exalted to the right hand of Hashem and having received the havtachah of the Ruach Hakodesh from HaAv, Moshiach poured out this which you also see and hear."

44,4,22,"For the man was more than arba'im shanah"
44,4,23,"And, after having been released, the Moshiach's Shluchim came to their own, and reported all the things the Rashei Hakohanim and the Zekenim had said to them."
44,4,24,"And having heard this, the people lifted their voices to Hashem with one mind, and said, Rabbono shel Olam, you are the one BARAH ES HASHOMAYIM V'ES HA'ARETZ and the yam and all that is  in them, [Bereshis 1:1; Nechemyah 9:6; Iyov 41:11; Yeshayah 37:16; Tehillim 146:6; Shemot 20:11]"
44,4,25,"and you are the one who by the Ruach Hakodesh through the mouth of Avinu Dovid your eved, said, LAMMAH RAGSHU GOYIM UL'UMMIM YEHIGU RIK"
44,4,26,"YITYATZVU MALKHEI ERETZ V'ROZNIM NOSEDU YACHAD AL HASHEM V'AL MOSHIACHO"
44,4,27,"For be'emes in this Ir, keneged"
44,4,28,"to do whatever that was by your hand and by your ratzon  nigzar merosh"
44,4,29,"And now, Adonoi, look upon their threats and grant that your avadim may speak your dvar with all ometz lev"
44,4,30,"while you stretch out your hand for refu'ah and otot and moftim to occur through the Shem of your Eved HaKadosh Yehoshua."
44,4,31,"And after they had davened, the place in which they had assembled was shaken and everyone was filled with the Ruach Hakodesh and they were speaking the dvar Hashem with ometz lev"
44,4,32,"Now the velt"
44,4,33,"And with gevaltike"
44,4,34,"For there was no one needy among them, for as many as were owners of sadot or batim were selling them and were bringing the proceeds of the sale"
44,4,35,"and were placing them at the feet of Moshiach's Shluchim and were distributing to each one as anyone was nitzrach"
44,4,36,"And Yosef, a Levi from Cyprus, a man having been named Bar-Nabba, by the Moshiach's Shluchim, a name which being translated means, Son of Encouragement,"
44,4,37,"this one owned a sadeh and, when he sold it, brought the kesef and laid it at the feet of Moshiach's Shluchim."
44,5,1,"And a certain man by the name Chananyah, with his wife Shappira, sold property"
44,5,2,"and he, with his wife in collusion as to da'as, misappropriated from the price, and, having brought a certain part, laid it at the feet of the Moshiach's Shluchim. [Yehoshua 7:11]"
44,5,3,"But Kefa said, Chananyah, why has Hasatan filled your lev"
44,5,4,"While it remained with you, did it not remain yours? And after it was sold, were the proceeds not under your samchut"
44,5,5,"And hearing these dvarim, having fallen down, Chananyah died; and there came great yirat Shomayim upon all the ones listening. [Tehillim 5:6]"
44,5,6,"And having got up, the bochrim threw a tachrichim over him and, having carried him out, they buried him in a kever."
44,5,7,"And there was an interval of lav davka"
44,5,8,"And in reply to her, Kefa said Tell me, you sold the sadeh for such and such a price, did you? And she said, Ken, for such and such a price, that was the amount."
44,5,9,"And Kefa said to her, Why was it agreed by the two of you to put the Ruach Hakodesh of Hashem to the test? --Hinei-- the feet of the ones having buried your ish are at the petach"
44,5,10,"And she fell immediately at his feet and died.  And, the bochrim, having entered, found her dead; and, having carried her out, they buried her with her ish."
44,5,11,"And there came great yirat Shomayim upon the whole kehillah and upon all the ones hearing these things. MANY OTOT AND MOFTIM ACCOMPLISHED"
44,5,12,"Now by the hands of the Moshiach's Shluchim were being effected many otot"
44,5,13,"But none of the rest was daring to be mishtatef in a chavura"
44,5,14,"And more and more ma'aminim hameshichiyim in Adoneinu were being added, multitudes of anashim and nashim,"
44,5,15,"so much so that even out into the rehkovot they would carry  the cholim and put them on pallets and mats, that when Kefa came by, at least his shadow might fall upon some of them."
44,5,16,"And also the multitudes from the shtetlach surrounding Yerushalayim were coming together, carrying the cholim and the ones being tormented by ruchot teme'ot"
44,5,17,"But there was an uprising of the Kohen Gadol and all the ones with him being of the kat the Tzedukim"
44,5,18,"And they laid their hands upon the Moshiach's Shluchim and they put them in a public beis hasohar."
44,5,19,"And a malach Adonoi"
44,5,20,"Go and stand and speak in the Beis Hamikdash to the people kol divrei HaChayyim haelleh."
44,5,21,"And having heard, the Moshiach's Shluchim entered the Beis Hamikdash at Shachrit and were giving shiurim.  And when the Kohen Gadol and the ones with him had come, they called together the Sanhedrin and all the assembly of Zekenim of the bnei Yisroel, and they sent to the beis hasohar for the prisoners to be brought to them."
44,5,22,"But their mesharetim, having come, did not find them in the beis hasohar.  And having returned, they reported these things"
44,5,23,"saying, We found the beis hasohar locked tight and the shomrim standing at the doors; but when we opened up, we found no one inside."
44,5,24,"And when the Sar Tzeva haHeichal of the Beis Hamikdash and the Rashei Hakohanim heard these words, they were perplexed about them, as far as what would come of all this."
44,5,25,"But someone came and reported to them, Hinei! The men whom you put in the beis hasohar are in the Beis Hamikdash standing and giving shiurim to the people."
44,5,26,"Then the Sar Tzeva haHeichal went along with the mesharetim and brought the Moshiach's Shluchim back, but not with force"
44,5,27,"And when they had brought them, they stood the Moshiach's Shluchim before the Sanhedrin, and the Kohen Gadol questioned them,"
44,5,28,"saying, Did we not with a strict command charge you not to give shiurim b'Shem haZeh and, hinei, you have filled Yerushalayim with your torah and are determined to bring upon us the dahm of this man."
44,5,29,"And in reply Kefa and the Moshiach's Shluchim said, It is necessary to obey Hashem rather than bnei Adam. [Shemot 1:17]"
44,5,30,"Elohei Avoteinu made Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua to stand up alive again, the very one whom you killed, having hung him on an aitz"
44,5,31,"This one Hashem exalted as Sar and Moshi'a"
44,5,32,"And we are edim of these matters and so is the Ruach Hakodesh whom Hashem gave to the ones obeying him."
44,5,33,"And the ones having heard were cut to the quick and in fury were deciding to do away with them.  AN EITZA FROM RABBAN GAMLI'EL"
44,5,34,"But a certain Parush got up in the Sanhedrin, a moreh of Torah by name Rabban Gamli'el, respected by kol Am Yisroel, and gave orders to put the men outside for for a little while."
44,5,35,"And Rabban Gamli'el said to them, Anshei Yisroel, pay attention to yourselves what you are about to do with these anashim."
44,5,36,"For at an earlier tekufa"
44,5,37,"After this there was Yehudah HaGelili in the yamim of the census; who misled the people to follow after him and that man perished and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered."
44,5,38,"And now I say to you, stay away from these anashim, and leave them alone, because if this cheshbon"
44,5,39,"but if it is from Hashem, you are not able to overthrow them, lest also you may be found fighting keneged"
44,5,40,"And having called together the Moshiach's Shluchim and having flogged them, they warned them not to speak in the Shem of Yehoshua, and they released them."
44,5,41,"Therefore Moshiach's Shluchim were going rejoicing from the presence of the Sanhedrin, that they were considered worthy to suffer shame for the Shem."
44,5,42,"And every day in the Beis Hamikdash and from bais to bais they did not stop giving shiurim and drashot about Yehoshua as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
44,6,1,"Now in these yamim of the talmidim being increased and hosafa"
44,6,2,"And the Sheneym Asar, having called the multitude of the talmidim together, said, It is not desirable for us to neglect the dvar Hashem in order to serve tishen."
44,6,3,"But select from among you Achim b'Moshiach, that is, shivah anashim, being of shem tov"
44,6,4,"but we will be devoted to tefillah and to the avodas kodesh of the Dvar of the Besuras HaGeulah."
44,6,5,"And this dvar found approval before all the multitude and they chose Stefanos, a man full of emunah"
44,6,6,"whom they placed before the Moshiach's Shluchim.  And having davened, Moshiach's Shluchim gave them s'michah, laying their hands on them. [Bamidbar 8:10; 27:18]"
44,6,7,"And the Dvar Hashem was increasing, and the number of talmidim was being greatly multiplied in Yerushalayim, and a kama"
44,6,8,"And Stefanos, full of the Chen v'Chesed Hashem and ko'ach"
44,6,9,"But some of the men from the shul called the Beit Knesset of the Meshuchrarim"
44,6,10,"and they were not able to contradict the chochmah and the Ruach Hakodesh with which he was speaking."
44,6,11,"Then they secretly induced anashim to say, We have heard him commit Chillul Hashem in the words he spoke keneged"
44,6,12,"And they aroused the people and the Zekenim and the Sofrim and they came upon Stefanos and they seized him and they brought him to the Sanhedrin,"
44,6,13,"and edey sheker"
44,6,14,"For we have heard him saying that this Yehoshua from Natzeret will destroy this place [the Beis Hamikdash] and will change the chukim of the Torah which Moshe Rabbenu handed down to us."
44,6,15,"And having stared intently at him, all the ones sitting in the Sanhedrin saw his ponem like the face of a malach."
44,7,1,"And the Kohen Gadol said, Are these things so?"
44,7,2,"And Stefanos said, Achim and Avot, hear me! Elohei Hakavod appeared to Avraham Avinu while he was in Mesopotamia before he lived in Haran [Tehillim 29:3; Bereshis 11:31; 15:7]"
44,7,3,"and YAYOMER HASHEM EL AVRAM, `LECH LECHA MEARTZECHA UMIMOLADTECHA U'MIBEIS AVICHA EL HAARETZ ASHER ARECHA'"
44,7,4,"Then having departed from the land of the Chaldeans, he settled in Charan.  And from there, after the mavet of his Av, he was settled by Hashem here in this land in which we now are living, [Bereshis 12:5]"
44,7,5,"and he did not give to him a nachalah"
44,7,6,"And Hashem spoke thus, that GER YIHIYEH ZAR'ACHA (your seed will be strangers"
44,7,7,"V'GAM ES HAGOY ASHER YA'AVODU DAN ANOKHI (And whatever nation to which they shall be in bondage I myself will judge said Hashem, VACHAREI KHEN YETZU"
44,7,8,"And he gave to him the Brit Milah.  And thus Avraham Avinu became the father of Yitzchak and he did his Brit Milah on the Yom HaShemini and Yitzchak became the father of Ya'akov and Ya'akov of the Sheneym Asar HaAvot. [Bereshis 17:9-14; 21:2-4; 25:26; 29:31-35; 30:5-13, 17-24; 35:16-18,22-26]"
44,7,9,"And the Avot had kinah toward Yosef and sold him into Mitzrayim"
44,7,10,"And Hashem delivered Yosef from all his tzoros and gave to him Chen v'Chesed Hashem and chochmah before Pharaoh king of Mitzrayim"
44,7,11,"Now a famine came over all Mitzrayim"
44,7,12,"And when Ya'akov Avinu heard that there was grain in Mitzrayim"
44,7,13,"And on the second visit Yosef was recognized by his Achim, and Yosef's mishpochah became known to Pharaoh. [Bereshis 45:1-4; Bereshis 45:16]"
44,7,14,"And having sent, Yosef summoned Ya'akov his Abba and all his mishpochah, SHIVIM"
44,7,15,"And Ya'akov Avinu went down to Mitzrayim"
44,7,16,"and they were brought back to Shechem and were placed in the kever"
44,7,17,"Now as the time of the havtachah was drawing near, which Hashem promised to Avraham Avinu, the people grew and were multiplied in Mitzrayim"
44,7,18,"until over Mitzrayim there appeared a MELECH CHADASH ASHER LO YADA ES YOSEF"
44,7,19,"This king exploited by his shrewdness our nation and mistreated Avoteinu so as to make their ollelim exposed in order not to keep them alive. [Shemot 1:10-22]"
44,7,20,"And at this time Moshe Rabbenu was born and he was well pleasing to Hashem; and he was nurtured for shloshah chodashim in the bais of his abba. [Shemot 2:2]"
44,7,21,"And after he had been exposed, the bat-Pharaoh took Moshe Rabbeinu away, and brought him up as her own son. [Shemot 2:3-10]"
44,7,22,"And Moshe Rabbenu was instructed in all the chochmah of the Egyptians and in dvarim and pe'ulot he was given ko'ach. [Melachim Alef 4:30; Yeshayah 19:11]"
44,7,23,"But when arba'im shanah of his days were completed, it entered into his lev"
44,7,24,"And having seen one of them being treated unjustly he retaliated and brought yashrus"
44,7,25,"Now he was assuming that his achim had binah that Hashem by the hand of Moshe was giving Yeshu'at Eloheinu to them, but they did not have binah."
44,7,26,"And on the next day he came to them as they were fighting and Moshe was trying to reconcile them in shalom, saying, `Anashim, you are achim, why are you injuring one another?' [Shemot 2:13]"
44,7,27,"But the one injuring his re'a pushed Moshe aside, saying MI SAMECHA L'SAR V'SHOFET ALENU"
44,7,28,"HALEHARGENI ATAH OMER KA'ASHER HARAGTA yesterday ET HAMITZRI"
44,7,29,"And Moshe Rabbenu fled at this dvar and became a stranger in eretz Midyan where he became the father of shnei banim. [Shemot 2:11-15]"
44,7,30,"And at the fulfillment of arba'im shanah a MALACH appeared to him BELABAT AISH MITOCH HASENEH"
44,7,31,"And Moshe Rabbenu having seen this, was mishpoyel"
44,7,32,"I am the G-d of your Avot, ANOCHI ELOHEI AVRAHAM ELOHEI YITZCHAK V'ELOHEI YA'AKOV"
44,7,33,"And Hashem said to him, SAL NE'ALECHA ME'AL RAGLECHA"

44,7,35,"This Moshe whom they denied having said MI SAMECHA L'SAR V'SHOFET?"
44,7,36,"This one led them out, effecting moftim and otot in eretz Mitzrayim"
44,7,37,"This is the Moshe who said to the Bnei Yisroel NAVI MIKIRBECHA ME'ACHECHA KAMONI YAKIM"
44,7,38,"This is the one having been in the kahal"
44,7,39,"And Avoteinu were not willing to have mishma'at"
44,7,40,"having said to Aharon, ASEH LANU ELOHIM ASHER YELEKHU LEFANENU, KI ZEH MOSHE ASHER HE''ELANU MEERETZ MITZRAYIM LO YADA'U MEH HAYAH LO"
44,7,41,"And at that time they made an egel"

44,7,43,"You also took up the ohel of Moloch and the KOKHAV of your g-d Reifan, the tzelamim"
44,7,44,"Avoteinu had the Mishkan HaEdut in the midbar just as the One who spoke to Moshe Rabbeinu directed him to make it according to the TAVNIT"
44,7,45,"And having received it in their turn, Avoteinu brought it in with Yehoshua"
44,7,46,"And Dovid found Chen v'Chesed Hashem before G-d, and asked that he might find a mishkanot for Elohei Ya'akov. [Shmuel Bais 7:2, 8-16; Melachim Alef 8:17; Tehillim 132:1-5]"

44,7,54,"And hearing these things, they were infuriated in their levavot, and they were grinding their teeth at him."
44,7,55,"But being full of the Ruach Hakodesh and having gazed into Shomayim, Stefanos saw the kavod"
44,7,56,"And Stefanos said, Hinei!  I see the Shomayim having been opened and the Ben HaAdam"
44,7,57,"And having cried out with a kol gadol, they shut their oznayim and they rushed down with one impulse upon Stefanos"
44,7,58,"and having driven Stefanos outside the Ir"

44,7,60,"And having fallen down, he cried out in a kol gadol,   Adoneinu, may this aveirah not be held against them! And having said this, Stefanos fell asleep."
44,8,1,"And Rav Sha'ul was giving approval to the murder of Stefanos and there came about in that day a great pogrom keneged"
44,8,2,"And chassidim came and gave kevurah"
44,8,3,"But Rav Sha'ul was making havoc of the Moshiach's Kehillah, barging in bais by bais, dragging off both anashim and nashim, and delivering them over to the beis hasohar. THE BESURAS HAGEULAH IS PREACHED IN SHOMRON, MAKING A GEZUNTE CONFRONTATION WITH THE POWERS OF THE OCCULT; A HITORERUT"
44,8,4,"The ones therefore having been scattered went about preaching the dvar Hashem."
44,8,5,"Now Philippos having gone down to the city of Shomron was preaching to them the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
44,8,6,"And the multitudes with one accord were paying attention to the things being said by Philippos, as they heard him and saw the otot which he was accomplishing."
44,8,7,"For many had ruchot teme'ot coming out, crying out with a kol gadol, and many having been paralyzed and many pisechim"
44,8,8,"And there was great simchah in that shtetl."
44,8,9,"Now a certain ish by name Shimon was previously in the shtetl practicing magic and astonishing the people of Shomron saying that he himself was an ish of gadlus"
44,8,10,"And to this Shimon everyone from katon to gadol was paying attention, saying, Hinei haIsh Hazeh is the ko'ach"
44,8,11,"And they were giving heed to him, because he for a long time  had astonished them by magic tricks."
44,8,12,"But when they had emunah in what Philippos preached about the Malchut Hashem and the Shem of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, they, both anashim and nashim, were submitting to Moshiach's tevilah of teshuvah."
44,8,13,"And Shimon himself also had emunah, and, having submitted to Moshiach's tevilah of teshuva, was following Philippos, and, seeing otot and and niflaot and moftim hagedolim taking place, he was constantly mishpoyel"
44,8,14,"And when Moshiach's Shluchim heard in Yerushalayim that Shomron has accepted the dvar Hashem, they sent Kefa and Yochanan to them,"
44,8,15,"who, having come down, davened for them that they might receive the Ruach Hakodesh."
44,8,16,"For the Ruach Hakodesh had not yet fallen upon anyone of them, but only they had received a tevilah of teshuvah in a mikveh mayim b'Shem Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu."
44,8,17,"Then Kefa and Yochanan were laying their hands upon them and they were receiving the Ruach Hakodesh."
44,8,18,"And when Shimon saw that through the laying on of hands of Moshiach's Shluchim that the Ruach Hakodesh is given, he brought to them kesef,"
44,8,19,"saying, Give me also this samchut"
44,8,20,"But Kefa said to him, May your kesef perish with you! Because the matnat Hashem you thought by kesef to acquire. [Melachim Bais 5:16; Daniel 5:17]"
44,8,21,"There is not to you a chelek"
44,8,22,"Therefore make teshuva"
44,8,23,"for I see you are in bitter gall and the bond of haresha. [Devarim 29:18 TARGUM HASHIVIM; Yirmeyah 4:18; Yeshayah 58:6]"
44,8,24,"And in reply Shimon said, Daven for me to Hashem that nothing may come upon me of which you have spoken. [Shemot 8:8; Bamidbar 21:7; Melachim Alef 13:6; Yirmeyah 42:2]"
44,8,25,"The ones then having testified and spoken the dvar Adonoi were returning to Yerushalayim and to many villages of the Shomronim preaching the Besuras HaGeulah.   PHILIPPOS AND THE ETHIOPIAN EUNUCH; THE BEGINNING OF THE FALASHA HITORERUT WHEN THE KETA"
44,8,26,"And a malach Adonoi spoke to Philippos, saying, Get up and go south on the derech going down from Yerushalayim to Gaza. This is desert."
44,8,27,"And having got up, Philippos went.  And, hinei, an Ethiopian man, a eunuch, a court official of the Kandake of the Ethiopians. He was over all of her Otzrot"
44,8,28,"And he was returning and sitting in his chariot and he was reading Yeshayah HaNavi."
44,8,29,"And the Ruach Hakodesh said to Philippos, Approach and join this chariot."
44,8,30,"And having run, Philippos heard him reading Yeshayah HaNavi, and Philippos said, So do you have binah of you are reading?"
44,8,31,"And he said, How then might I be able, unless someone will guide me?  And he invited Philippos to come up and sit with him."
44,8,32,"Now the keta"
44,8,33,"`In humiliation his judgment was taken away.  The descendants of him who will tell?  Because he is taken away from HA'ARETZ CHAYYIM.' [Yeshayah 53:7,8; 57:7f TARGUM HASHIVIM]"

44,8,35,"And having opened his mouth, and beginning from this keta"
44,8,36,"And as they were going along the derech, they came upon some mayim and the eunuch says, Hinei, mayim!  What prevents me from undergoing Moshiach's tevilah of teshuvah in the mikveh mayim?"
44,8,37,"missing fehlt/missing"
44,8,38,"And he commanded the chariot to stop and both went down into the mikveh mayim, both Philippos and the eunuch, and Philippos administered Moshiach's tevilah of teshuvah in the mikveh mayim."
44,8,39,"And when they came up from the mikveh mayim, the Ruach Hakodesh of Hashem took Philippos away, and the eunuch did not see him any longer, but was going on his way with lev same'ach. [Melachim Alef 18:12; Melachim Bais 2:16; Yechezkel 3:12,14; 8:3; 11:1,24; 43:5]"
44,8,40,"But Philippos was found in Ashdod, and passing through, he was preaching the Besuras HaGeulah to all shtetlach until he came to Caesarea."
44,9,1,"Now Sha'ul still breathing a threat even of retzach"
44,9,2,"He requested from him iggrot of reshus"
44,9,3,"Now as he goes, it came about that he comes near Damascus, and suddenly shone around him an Ohr"
44,9,4,"and he fell on the ground, and heard a kol"

44,9,6,"But get up and enter into the city, and it shall be told to you what it is necessary for you to do. [Yechezkel 3:22]"
44,9,7,"And the anashim traveling with Rav Sha'ul had stood speechless, hearing [Sha'ul's] voice but seeing no one. [Daniel 10:7]"
44,9,8,"And Rav Sha'ul got up from the ground, and, though his eyes were open, he was seeing nothing.  And leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus."
44,9,9,"And he was shloshah yamim not seeing and neither did he eat nor drink."
44,9,10,"Now there was a certain talmid in Damascus, by name Chananyah, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu spoke to him in a chazon"
44,9,11,"And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu said to him, Get up and go to the rehkov"

44,9,13,"And Chananyah answered, Adoni, I heard from many about this man, how many ra'ot"
44,9,14,"And here he has samchut"
44,9,15,"But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu said to him, Go, for this one is a keli nivchar"
44,9,16,"For I will show him how much it is necessary for him to undergo innuyim on behalf of Shemi."
44,9,17,"And Chananyah departed and entered into the bais and having placed his hands upon Rav Sha'ul, he said, Ach b'Moshiach Sha'ul, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu has sent me.  I'm referring to Yehoshua, the one who appeared to you on the derech by which you were coming.  He sent me that you may see again and may be filled with the Ruach Hakodesh."
44,9,18,"And immediately fell from his eyes something like scales, and Rav Sha'ul saw again, and, having got up, he submitted to Moshiach's tevilah of teshuvah. RAV SHA'UL DELIVERS DRASHOT IN THE SHULS AT DAMASCUS"
44,9,19,"And having received okhel"
44,9,20,"And immediately in the shuls Rav Sha'ul was preaching Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, saying He is the Ben HaElohim."
44,9,21,"And all the ones listening were astonished, and they were saying, Is this not the one making havoc in Yerushalayim among the ones invoking this Shem?  And was not his tachlis"
44,9,22,"But Sha'ul even more was being strengthened and was confounding the unbelieving Yehudim dwelling in Damascus, by proving that this Yehoshua is the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. RAV SHA'UL ESCAPES FROM THE ONES OF THE YEHUDIM IN DAMASCUS WHO WERE UNBELIEVING"
44,9,23,"But when yamim rabbim were completed, the ones of the Yehudim who were unbelieving plotted to kill him."
44,9,24,"But the mezimma"
44,9,25,"But Moshiach's talmidim had taken him b'lailah and they let him down through an opening in the wall, having lowered him in a large basket. [Shmuel Alef 19:12] RAV SHA'UL AT YERUSHALAYIM; HE IS MESHADECH"
44,9,26,"And having arrived in Yerushalayim, Rav Sha'ul was trying to associate with the Moshiach's talmidim, and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he is a talmid."
44,9,27,"But Bar-Nabba, having taken hold of him, brought him to Moshiach's Shluchim and told them how on the derech he saw the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu, who had spoken to Rav Sha'ul, and how in Damascus Rav Sha'ul spoke with ometz lev"
44,9,28,"And Rav Sha'ul was with them, going in and coming out in Yerushalayim, speaking boldly b'Shem Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu."
44,9,29,"And Rav Sha'ul was speaking and debating keneged"
44,9,30,"But having learned of this, the Achim b'Moshiach brought Rav Sha'ul down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus."
44,9,31,"Then Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's Kehillah throughout all of Yehudah and the Galil and Shomron had shalom and was increasing, being built up, and going on in the yir'at Shomayim and in the yir'at Moshiach Adoneinu and, beNechamat HaRuach Hakodesh. THE REFU'AH OF AENEAS"
44,9,32,"Now it came about that Kefa, passing through all the parts of Eretz Yisrael, came down also to Moshiach's kedoshim dwelling in Lud."
44,9,33,"And there Kefa found a certain ish by name Aeneas who had been bedridden shmoneh shanim, for he was paralyzed."
44,9,34,"And Kefa said to him, Aeneas! Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua heals you.  Get up and make your bed!  And immediately he got up."
44,9,35,"And everyone dwelling in Lud and Sharon saw him, and they turned to Adoneinu. [Divrey Hayamim Alef 5:16; 27:29; 2:1; Yeshayah 33:9; 35:2; 65:10] TAVITHA PREPARED BY A CHEVRA KADISHA FOR KEVURAH ON THE SAME DAY IS RESTORED TO CHAYYIM BY MOSHIACH'S SHLIACH SHIMON KEFA"
44,9,36,"Now in Yafo there was a certain talmidah by name Tavitha, which, being translated, means gazelle. This one was abounding in ma'asim tovim and in giving tzedakah, which she was always doing. [Yehoshua1 9:46; Divrey Hayamim Bais 2:16; Ezra 3:7]"
44,9,37,"And it came about in yamim hahem that this one, having become ill, passed away.  When the women had washed her body, they laid it in the upper story."
44,9,38,"And since Lud was near to Yafo, Moshiach's talmidim, having heard that Kefa was there, sent shnei anashim to him, summoning Kefa that he not delay in coming to them."
44,9,39,"Kefa, getting up, went with them.  And when he arrived, they brought him up into the upper story room, and all the almanot stood beside him, weeping and showing the tunics and garments that Tavitha made while she was with them."
44,9,40,"But Kefa, having put everyone outside, and having fallen down, davened.  And when he turned to the niftar, he said, Tavitha, get up!  And she opened her eynayim and, having seen Kefa, she sat up."
44,9,41,"And having given his hand to her, he made her to stand up alive again; and, having called the Moshiach's kedoshim and the almanot, Kefa presented her chayyah"
44,9,42,"It became known throughout all Yafo, and rabbim"
44,9,43,"And it came about that Kefa remained in Yafo yamim rabbim with a certain Shimon, a tanner."
44,10,1,"Now a certain ish in Caesarea by name Cornelius, a centurion from what was called the Italian cohort,"
44,10,2,"a devout man, a yire Elohim, as was all his bais, who practiced much tzedakah for the benefit of Am Yisroel, and davened to Hashem continually."
44,10,3,"Cornelius clearly saw in a chazon"
44,10,4,"And having looked intently at him and having become afraid, Cornelius said, What is it, Adon?  The malach said to him, Your tefillos and your giving tzedakah have ascended as a zekaron"
44,10,5,"Now dispatch some anashim to Yafo and send for a certain Shimon who is also called Kefa."
44,10,6,"This one is staying with a certain Shimon, a tanner, whose bais is by the sea."
44,10,7,"And, when the malach speaking to him had departed, Cornelius summoned shnayim of his household avadim and a devout chaiyal"
44,10,8,"and, having explained everything to them, sent them to Yafo."
44,10,9,"Now on the next day, as these were traveling and drawing near to Yafo, around the sixth hour"
44,10,10,"And Kefa became hungry, and was wanting to have a meal; but while they were preparing it, Kefa fell into a trance;"
44,10,11,"and he sees Shomayim having been opened, and a certain object descending like a large linen cloth lowered by four corners upon haAretz."
44,10,12,"In this were all the four-footed animals and remesh haAdamah and Of haShomayim"
44,10,13,"And there came a kol"
44,10,14,"But Kefa said, Chalilah li, Adonoi! For I have never eaten basar pigulim"
44,10,15,"And the kol came to Kefa again for a second time, What Hashem made tahor"
44,10,16,"And this happened shloshah pe'amim; and immediately the object was taken up into Shomayim."
44,10,17,"Now, while Kefa was greatly perplexed within himself as to what the chazon which he saw might be, hinei, the anashim, who had been sent by Cornelius, and who had, by inquiring, found the bais of Shimon, stood at the gate;"
44,10,18,"and, calling out, they were asking if Shimon, the one called Kefa, is staying here."
44,10,19,"And while Kefa was reflecting on the chazon, the Ruach Hakodesh said to him, Hinei, shloshah anashim are looking for you."
44,10,20,"But get up and go downstairs and accompany them without  apprehensions, for I myself have sent them."
44,10,21,"And Kefa went downstairs to the anashim and said, Hinei, I am the one whom you are seeking; for what reason did you come?"
44,10,22,"And they said, Cornelius, a centurion, an ish tzaddik, and a yire Elohim with a shem tov with all the Am HaYehudim, was directed by a malach kadosh to summon you to his bais and to hear a message from you."
44,10,23,"Therefore, having invited them in, Kefa gave them hachnosas orchim"
44,10,24,"And on the next day, Moshiach's Shliach Shimon Kefa entered into Caesarea, and Cornelius was expecting them, having called together his krovey mishpokhot"
44,10,25,"Now when it came about that Kefa entered, Cornelius met him, falling at his feet to pay him reverence. [Daniel 7:14; 3:18]"
44,10,26,"Kefa made him stand up, saying, Get up.  I myself am an ish also"
44,10,27,"And as he conversed with Cornelius, Kefa entered and finds many having assembled,"
44,10,28,"and he said to them, You have da'as that it is asur"
44,10,29,"Therefore, also, when summoned, I came, raising no objections.  And so I ask for what reason you summoned me?"
44,10,30,"Cornelius said, Four days ago to this hour, I was davening in my bais at the ninth hour, and, hinei, an ish stood before me in shining malbush"
44,10,31,"and he says, `Cornelius, your tefillah was heard and your tzedakah are remembered before Hashem."
44,10,32,"`Therefore, send to Yafo and summon Shimon who is called Kefa.  He is staying in the bais of Shimon the tanner by the sea.'"
44,10,33,"At once I sent for you and you did well having come. Now, therefore, we all are present before Hashem to hear all the things that have been commanded to you by Adonoi. SHIMON KEFA SPEAKS IN CORNELIUS' HOUSE"
44,10,34,"And opening his mouth, Kefa said, Omein, I have binah that Hashem is not one to show masso panim"
44,10,35,"but in every nation the ones who have yirat Shomayim and work Tzedek [Daniel 9:25] are acceptable to him."
44,10,36,"The dvar which he sent to the Bnei Yisroel, preaching shalom through Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua"
44,10,37,"--you know the thing which took place throughout all Yehudah, having begun from the Galil after the tevilah of teshuvah which Yochanan preached,"
44,10,38,"You know Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua from Natzeret, how Hashem anointed him with the Ruach Hakodesh and with ko'ach"
44,10,39,"We are edim"
44,10,40,"This one Hashem made to stand up alive again on the Yom HaShlishi and granted to him to be visible,"
44,10,41,"not to Klal Yisroel, but to edim which had been chosen beforehand by Hashem, that is, to us who ate and drank together with him at Tish after his Techiyas HaMesim."
44,10,42,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave mitzvah to us to preach to the people and to bear solemn edut"
44,10,43,"To this one all the Nevi'im"
44,10,44,"While Kefa was still speaking these words, the Ruach Hakodesh fell upon all the ones hearing the dvar."
44,10,45,"And the Messianic Jews who had come with Kefa were mishpoyel"
44,10,46,"For they were hearing them speaking in leshonot and exalting Hashem.  Then Kefa answered,"
44,10,47,"Surely no one can refuse the mikveh mayim for these to be given Moshiach's tevilah of teshuvah who have received the tevilah in the Ruach Hakodesh just as we did, can he?  [Acts 2:4]"
44,10,48,"And Kefa gave orders for them to be given Moshiach's tevilah of teshuvah in the Shem of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua. Then they asked him to remain some yamim."
44,11,1,"And the Moshiach's Shluchim and the Achim b'Moshiach, the ones throughout Yehudah, heard that also the Goyim received the dvar Hashem."
44,11,2,"But when Kefa went up to Yerushalayim, those of the faction of the Bris Milah were taking issue with him,"
44,11,3,"saying, You entered into a bais of anashim arelim"
44,11,4,"But Kefa began explaining to them beseder"
44,11,5,"I was davening in the shtetl of Yafo and in a trance I saw a chazon"
44,11,6,"And when I had gazed upon it, I saw four-footed animals of ha'aretz and chayyat hasadeh and remesh haAdamah and Of HaShomayim."
44,11,7,"And I heard also a kol saying to me, Get up, Kefa. Kill and eat."
44,11,8,"But I said, `By no means, Adoni, because nothing common or tameh"
44,11,9,"And the kol answered for a second time from Shomayim, `What  Hashem made tahor"
44,11,10,"This happened shlosh pe'amim and everything was pulled up again into Shomayim."
44,11,11,"--Hineh-- at once shloshah anashim stood at the bais in which I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me."
44,11,12,"And the Ruach Hakodesh said to me to accompany them without having hesitated and these sheshet haAchim b'Moshiach came with me also, and we entered into the bais of the ish."
44,11,13,"He reported to us how he saw the malach in his bais having stood and having said, `Send to Yafo and summon Shimon, the one being called Kefa,"
44,11,14,"`who will speak words to you by which you and all your bais  will find Yeshu'at Eloheinu.'"
44,11,15,"As I began to speak, the Ruach Hakodesh fell upon them, just as also upon us in the beginning."
44,11,16,"And I remembered the dvar of Rebbe, Melech, HaMoshiach Adoneinu, how he used to say, `Yochanan gave a tevilah of teshuva with a mikveh mayim, but you will be given a tevilah with the Ruach Hakodesh.'"
44,11,17,"If then Hashem gave the same matanah to them as also to us  after believing in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu, who then was I to  stand in the way of Hashem?"
44,11,18,"And having heard these things, they remained silent and glorified Hashem, saying `Then also to the Nations Hashem has given teshuva unto Chayyim.'  THE BRIT CHADASHA KEHILLAH AT ANTIOCH"
44,11,19,"Then the ones, that is, those having been scattered because of the tzoros that happened in connection with Stefanos, came to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking to no one the dvar Hashem except only to Yehudim."
44,11,20,"And there were some of them, anashim of Cyprus and Cyrene, who having come to Antioch, were speaking also to the Yevanim"
44,11,21,"The hand of Adonoi was on them and a large number, having had emunah, turned to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu."
44,11,22,"The report about them was heard in the ears of the Kehillah of Moshiach in Yerushalayim, and they sent out Bar-Nabba to go to Antioch;"
44,11,23,"who having come, and having seen the Chen v'Chesed Hashem,  rejoiced and was encouraging every one devoted of lev to remain true to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu."
44,11,24,"For Bar-Nabba was a a mentsh, a gavra, an ish tov full of the Ruach Hakodesh and of emunah. And a great multitude was added to Adoneinu."
44,11,25,"And Bar-Nabba left for Tarsus to look for Sha'ul,"
44,11,26,"and, having found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came about that for an entire year, they met with Moshiach's Kehillah there, and taught a large multitude. And it was in Antioch the talmidim were first called ma'aminim hameshichiyim"
44,11,27,"Now in these yamim, nevi'im came down from Yerushalayim to Antioch."
44,11,28,"One of them, by name Agav, having got up, indicated through the Ruach Hakodesh a great famine was about to come all over the world. And this famine actually occurred during the time of Claudius."
44,11,29,"Now the talmidim decided that according to their means, each of them would send support to the Achim b'Moshiach dwelling in Yehudah;"
44,11,30,"which also they did, having sent to the Ziknei HaKehillot by the hand of Bar-Nabba and Sha'ul."
44,12,1,"Now during that time Herod the king laid his hands on Moshiach's Kehillah to harm some of them."
44,12,2,"He killed Ya'akov the ach Yochanan with a cherev"
44,12,3,"Having seen that this was pleasing to the Judeans, Herod proceeded to arrest Kefa also.  This happened during the yamim of Chag HaMatzot. [Shemot 12:15; 23:25]"
44,12,4,"When he had Kefa seized, he put him in the beis hasohar, having handed him over to four squads of chaiyalim to guard him, intending after Pesach to bring him before the people."
44,12,5,"Therefore, Kefa was being kept in the beis hasohar.  But tefillah to Hashem was earnestly being made by Moshiach's Kehillah for him.  SHIMON KEFA DELIVERED FROM THE BEIS HASOHAR"
44,12,6,"But b'lailah, when Herod was about to lead him out, Kefa, bound with two shasherot"
44,12,7,"Then--hinei--a malach HaAdon approached and ohr"
44,12,8,"The malach said to Kefa, Put on your gartel and tie your sandals. And Kefa did so. And the malach says to him, Put on your kaftan and follow me."
44,12,9,"And having gone out, Kefa was following the malach, and he did not have da'as that the thing happening was grahda"
44,12,10,"And having gone through the shomrim, the rishonim and the sheniyyim, they came upon the Sha'ar HaBarzel leading to the Ir Kodesh.  This was opened to them by itself. And having gone out, they went along one rehkov"
44,12,11,"And Kefa, having come to himself, said, Now I have da'as for sure that HaAdon sent out his malach and delivered me from the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the Judean people. [Tehillim 34:7; Daniel 3:28; 6:22]"
44,12,12,"Having realized this, Kefa came upon the bais of Miryam the em"
44,12,13,"And when Kefa knocked on the delet"
44,12,14,"And having recognized the kol of Kefa, from simcha she did not open the gate but, having run inside, she reported that Kefa stood at the gate."
44,12,15,"But the ones there said to her, You are meshuggah! But she kept insisting it was so. But they were saying, It is his malach."
44,12,16,"But Kefa continued knocking. And having opened the gate, they saw him, and were mishpoyel"
44,12,17,"And having motioned to them with his hand to be silent, he told them how HaAdon led him out from the beis hasohar. Then Kefa  said, Report to Ya'akov and to the Achim b'Moshiach these things. And having gone out, Kefa went to another place."
44,12,18,"Now when it was boker, there was not a little commotion among the chaiyalim as to what had become of Kefa."
44,12,19,"Now Herod, having sought after him and not having found him, after questioning the shomrim, commanded them to be led away to execution.  Then Herod went down from Yehudah to Caesarea, and was staying there.    THE MAVET OF HEROD"
44,12,20,"Now Herod was gor"
44,12,21,"Now on the appointed day, Herod, having clothed himself with royal malbush"
44,12,22,"And the multitude was crying out, Hinei, the kol of Hashem and not of an ish!"
44,12,23,"Immediately, a malach Adonoi struck him, because he did not give the kavod to Hashem. And, having become eaten with worms, Herod died. [Shmuel Alef 25:38; Shmuel Bais 24:16,17; Melachim Bais 19:35]"
44,12,24,"But the dvar Hashem was growing and increasing."
44,12,25,"And Bar-Nabba and Sha'ul returned from Yerushalayim, having fulfilled their shlichut to deliver the tzedakah and having taken along with them [back to Antioch], Yochanan the one called Markos."
44,13,1,"Now there were in Antioch among the Moshiach's Kehillah there nevi'im and morim: Bar-Nabba, and Shimon called Niger, and Lucius from Cyrene, and Menachem"
44,13,2,"They were ministering to Adonoi and under a tzom when the Ruach HaKodesh said to them, Set apart for me Bar-Nabba and Sha'ul for the avodas kodesh to which I have called them. [Divrey haYomim Bais 13:10; 35:3; Yechezkel 40:46; 44:16; 45:4]"
44,13,3,"Then, having continued the tzom and having davened and having laid their hands upon them, they sent them off.  THE MOSHIACH'S SHLUCHIM PREACH IN CYPRUS AND ENCOUNTER A SHABTSITVAINIK"
44,13,4,"They, then, having been sent out by the Ruach Hakodesh, went down to Seleucia, and from there sailed away to Cyprus."
44,13,5,"Having arrived in Salamis, they were proclaiming the dvar Hashem in the shuls, with Yochanan Markos also as ozer"
44,13,6,"Having passed through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain ish, a magician, a Jewish navi sheker, to whom was the name Bar-Yehoshua,"
44,13,7,"who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an ish of seychel.  This one, having summoned Bar-Nabba and Sha'ul, sought to hear the dvar Hashem."
44,13,8,"But Elymas the magician was opposing them"
44,13,9,"But Rav Sha'ul, the one also called Paulos, having been filled with the Ruach Hakodesh, gazed at him,"
44,13,10,"and said, O ish full of all mirmah and all resha, ben haSatan, oyev"
44,13,11,"Now --heini-- the yad Hashem is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the shemesh"
44,13,12,"Then, the proconsul, having seen what had happened, had emunah, being mishpoyel"
44,13,13,"And having put out to sea from Paphos, Rav Sha'ul and those   with him came to Perga of Pamphylia.  But Yochanan"
44,13,14,"But having gone on from Perga, they came to Pisidian Antioch, and, having entered the shul on Shabbos, they sat down."
44,13,15,"After the keriat HaTorah and the keriat HaNeviim, the Rashei Beit HaKnesset sent to them, saying, Anashim Achim if there is any dvar hachizzuk among you to the people, say it."
44,13,16,"And having got up and having motioned with his hand, Rav Sha'ul said, Anshei Yisroel and Yirei Elohim, listen!"
44,13,17,"Elohei HaAm Yisroel chose Avoteinu. Hashem made the people  great during their sojourn in the land of Mitzrayim"

44,13,20,"during lav davka"
44,13,21,"And then they asked for a melech, and Hashem gave to them Sha'ul Ben Kish, an ish from the shevet of Binyamin, for arba'im shanah, [Shmuel Alef 8:5,19; 10:1; 9:1,2]"
44,13,22,"And after having removed Sha'ul, Hashem raised up Dovid as a Melech for them. About Dovid also Hashem spoke favorably, saying `I found Dovid Ben Yishai an ISH KILEVAVO (a man after his [G-d's] heart] who will do all my ratzon.'

44,13,26,"Achim, Bnei Mishpochah Avraham, and Yirei Elohim, it is to us that the dvar of this Yeshu'at Eloheinu was sent out. [Tehillim 107:20]"
44,13,27,"For the ones dwelling in Yerushalayim and their rashim did not have da'as of this one or of the dvarim of the Nevi'im being read every Shabbos; they fulfilled these dvarim by condemning him."
44,13,28,"Even without finding a cause for a sentence of mavet, they asked Pilate that he be done away with."
44,13,29,"When they finished all the things having been written about him, he was taken down from the aitz"

44,13,32,"And we are preaching to you the Besuras HaGeulah of the Havtachah made to Avoteinu, [Yeshayah 40:9; 52:7]"
44,13,33,"that Hashem has fulfilled this havtachah for us, their banim, having made to stand up alive again Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshuah, as also in the Tehillim it has been written, BENI ATAH, ANI HAYOM YELIDETICHA"
44,13,34,"And that he made him to stand up alive again from the Mesim, no longer to return to decay, thus he has said, `I will give you CHASEDEI DOVID HANE'EMANIM. [Yeshayah 55:3 TARGUM HASHIVIM]"

44,13,48,"Now hearing this, the Goyim rejoiced with simcha gedolah and were praising the dvar Hashem.  And as many as had been destined to Chayyim Olam became ma'aminim hameshichiyim."
44,13,49,"And the dvar Hashem was spreading through the entire region."
44,13,50,"But the Yehudim aroused the chashuve"
44,13,51,"And having shaken off the dust of their feet against them, Rav Sha'ul and Bar-Nabba came to Iconium;"
44,13,52,"and the talmidim were being filled with simcha and the Ruach Hakodesh."
44,14,1,"Now it came about in Iconium that together they entered into the shul and the same thing transpired: they spoke with the result that both Yehudim and and a great multitude of Yevanim became ma'aminim hameshichiyim."
44,14,2,"And the Yehudim who disobeyed were the ones who aroused and stirred up in anger the nefashot"
44,14,3,"Therefore, they continued for a long zman"
44,14,4,"And the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the [disobedient, 14:2] Yehudim but, others, with the Moshiach's Shluchim."
44,14,5,"And when an attempt came by both the Goyim and the Yehudim with their rashim to mistreat and to stone them,"
44,14,6,"when the Moshiach's Shluchim became aware of this, they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the surrounding countryside."
44,14,7,"And there the Moshiach's Shluchim were preaching the Besuras HaGeulah. RAV SHA'UL AND BAR-NABBA AT LYSTRA"
44,14,8,"And a certain ish in Lystra, powerless in his feet, was sitting, pise'ach from his imma's womb, a man who had never walked."
44,14,9,"This one heard Rav Sha'ul speaking, and when he gazed at the man and saw that he has emunah"
44,14,10,"Rav Sha'ul said in a kol gadol, Stand upright on your feet. And the man jumped up and was walking around. [Yechezkel 2:1]"
44,14,11,"And the multitudes, when they saw what Rav Sha'ul did, shouted in the Lycaonian language, saying, The g-ds, having been made like anashim, have come down to us."
44,14,12,"And they were calling Bar-Nabba Zeus and Rav Sha'ul Hermes, vi-bahlt"
44,14,13,"And the priest of Zeus was outside the city and brought bulls and flower wreaths to the gates; he and the multitudes wanted to offer a pagan zevach."
44,14,14,"But having heard this, the Moshiach's Shluchim Bar-Nabba and Rav Sha'ul tore their kaftans and rushed out into the crowd, crying out,"
44,14,15,"Anashim, why are you doing these things?  We also are of the same nature as you, mere men, preaching to you to turn in teshuva from these worthless things to the Elohim Chayyim who made HASHOMAYIM V'ES HAARETZ V'ES HAYAM and all the things in them; [Shmuel Alef 12:21; Bereshis 1:1; Tehillim 146:6; Shemot 20:11]"
44,14,16,"In the dorot having passed, Hashem allowed all the Goyim to go their own way. [Tehillim 81:12; Michoh 4:5]"
44,14,17,"And yet Hashem did not leave himself without an eidus"
44,14,18,"And even saying these things, it was with difficulty that Moshiach's Shluchim restrained the multitudes from offering pagan zevachim to them. [Amos 9:11 TARGUM HASHIVIM; Yirmeyah 12:15; Yeshayah 45:21]"
44,14,19,"Then [disobedient] Yehudim came from Pisidian Antioch and Iconium and, having won over the crowds and having stoned Rav Sha'ul, they were dragging him outside the city, thinking he had died."
44,14,20,"And after the Moshiach's talmidim had surrounded Rav Sha'ul, he got up and entered the city.  And on the next day he went  with Bar-Nabba to Derbe.  THE RETURN TO ANTIOCH IN SYRIA"
44,14,21,"And having preached the Besuras HaGeulah in that city and having made many talmidim, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Pisidian Antioch,"
44,14,22,"strengthening the nefashot"
44,14,23,"And having chosen for messianic s'michah Zekenim installed in every one of Moshiach's Kehillot, and having davened with tzomot, the Moshiach's Shluchim commended them to Adoneinu in whom they had had emunah."
44,14,24,"And having gone through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia."
44,14,25,"And having spoken the dvar Hashem in Perga, they went down to Attalia;"
44,14,26,"And from there, they sailed away to Syrian Antioch, their point of origin from which they had been commended to the Chen v'Chesed Hashem to the Messianic avodas kodesh which they had completed."
44,14,27,"Upon their arrival in Syrian Antioch, they assembled the Moshiach's Kehillah there, and were reporting what Hashem had done with them and how he had opened for the Nations a sha'ar of emunah."
44,14,28,"And they were spending not a little zman with the talmidim."
44,15,1,"And some men came down from Yehudah to Syrian Antioch and were teaching the Achim b'Moshiach that if you lack the Bris Milah as prescribed by Moshe Rabbenu, it is impossible for you to come to Yeshu'at Eloheinu."
44,15,2,"Now this brought them into a dispute and a debate of no little proportion with Rav Sha'ul and Bar-Nabba, who were appointed to go up with some others from them to bring this sheilah"
44,15,3,"Then having been sent on their way by the Kehillah, they were passing through both Phoenicia and Shomron telling in detail how the Nations were turning to Hashem and they were bringing great simcha to all the Achim b'Moshiach."
44,15,4,"And having come to Yerushalayim, they were there received by Moshiach's Kehillah and the Moshiach's Shluchim and the Zekenim and they reported what things Hashem had done with them."
44,15,5,"But some of the ma'aminim hemeshichiyim from the kat of the Perushim rose up, saying, It is necessary to give the Goyim the Bris Milah and to command them to be shomer mitzvot, keeping the Torah of Moshe Rabbenu."
44,15,6,"And the Moshiach's Shluchim and the Zekenim were gathered together as a council to consider this matter."
44,15,7,"And after much deliberation had taken place, Moshiach's Shliach Shimon Kefa got up.  Kefa said to them, Anashim, Achim b'Moshiach, you have da'as that in the early days Hashem chose that among you I would be the one and through my mouth the Goyim would hear the dvar Hashem of the Besuras HaGeulah and would come to emunah [in the Orthodox Jewish faith]. IT IS THE TEVILAH OF THE RUACH HAKODESH THAT IS HASHEM'S WITNESS AS TO WHO, WHETHER BORN JEWISH OR NON-JEWISH, HAS IN FACT BECOME MEKABEL OF THE TRUE ORTHODOX JEWISH FAITH OF THE TRUE MOSHIACH"
44,15,8,"And the One who has da'as of levavot, Hashem, bore solemn edut and stood as their witness, having given the non-Jews the tevilah in the Ruach Hakodesh just as Hashem did also to us Jews [Acts 2:4; 10:46]."
44,15,9,"And in making tehorot their levavot by emunah, in this repect Hashem did not differentiate between us Jews and those non-Jews."
44,15,10,"Therefore, now why are you testing Hashem by laying an ol"
44,15,11,"On the contrary, Anu Ma'aminim"
44,15,12,"And then all the multitude was silent and they were listening to Bar-Nabba and Rav Sha'ul describing what otot and moftim Hashem did among the Nations through them."
44,15,13,"And after Rav Sha'ul and Bar-Nabba fell silent, Moshiach's Shliach Ya'akov responded, saying, Anashim, Achim b'Moshiach, listen to me.  THE REPLY OF THE MOSHIACH'S BRIT CHADASHA SANHEDRIN TO SHIMON KEFA, RAV SHA'UL AND BAR-NABBA: TNOIM"
44,15,14,"Shimon explained how Hashem rishonah"
44,15,15,"And this is in agreement with the dvarim of the Nevi'im,  just as it has been written,"
44,15,16,"`After these things I will return and V'AKIM ES SUKKAT DOVID HANOFELET VHARISOTAV AKIM U'VENITIHA"
44,15,17,"`so that the she'arit"
44,15,18,"SAYS THE L-RD, WHO MAKES THESE THINGS KNOWN FROM LONG AGO [Amos 9:11f TARGUM HASHIVIM, 12; Yirmeyah 12:15; Yeshayah 45:21]"
44,15,19,"Therefore, it is my judgment not to trouble the ones from the Goyim turning in teshuva to Hashem,"
44,15,20,"but to write to them to keep away from the pollution of elilim and of zenut and of the thing strangled and of dahm. [Vayikra 3:17; 7:26; 17:10-13; 19:26; Devarim 12:16,23]"
44,15,21,"For Moshe Rabbenu from ancient dorot in every shtetl has his maggidim and in the shuls every Shabbos he has been read.  THE REPLY OF THE MOSHIACH'S ORTHODOX JEWISH BRIT CHADASHA"
44,15,22,"Then it was mekabel by the Moshiach's Shluchim and the Zekenim with the entire Kehillah to choose anashim from them to send to Syrian Antioch with Rav Sha'ul and Bar-Nabba, also Yehudah called Bar-Sabba, and Sila, all manhigim among the Achim b'Moshiach,"
44,15,23,"with the following iggeret: From the Achim b'Moshiach, Moshiach's Shluchim and the Zekenim: to the Achim b'Moshiach throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, to those from among the Nations, Shalom!"
44,15,24,"Vi-bahlt"
44,15,25,"it was mekabel to us, having come to achdut in mind and having chosen anashim to send to you, along with our beloved chaverim Bar-Nabba and Sha'ul--"
44,15,26,"anashim who have imperilled their lives for ha-Shem of  Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua--"
44,15,27,"Therefore we have sent Yehudah and Sila, and they too will confirm us in person by word of mouth."
44,15,28,"For it was mekabel to the Ruach Hakodesh and to us to lay no heavier burden upon you who are from the Nations except these necessary things:"
44,15,29,"that you non-Jewish ma'aminim hameshichiyim keep away from meat sacrificed to elilim, and dahm, and what is strangled, and zenut.   If you are shomer to avoid these, you will do well.  Shalom! THE MOSHIACH'S SHLUCHIM TAKE THE IGGERET TO THE NON-JEWISH MA'AMINIM HAMESHICHIYIM AND DEPART"
44,15,30,"Therefore, having been dismissed, they went down to Syrian Antioch, and having gathered together the multitude, they delivered the iggeret."
44,15,31,"And having read it, there was a response of simcha gedolah at the exhortation."
44,15,32,"Both Yehudah and Sila, being themselves nevi'im hameshichiyim also, with many dvarim comforted the Achim b'Moshiach and gave them chizzuk."
44,15,33,"And after they had spent considerable time, they were dismissed with shalom from the Achim b'Moshiach and sent back to the ones having dispatched them. [Shmuel Alef 1:17]"
44,15,34,"missing fehlt/missing"
44,15,35,"And Rav Sha'ul and Bar-Nabba were staying in Syrian Antioch saying shiurim and drashot with also many others, the content of these being the dvar Hashem.    RAV SHA'UL AND BAR-NABBA BECOME BROIGEZ AND SEPARATE"
44,15,36,"And after some yamim Rav Sha'ul said to Bar-Nabba, Let's return, then and visit the Achim b'Moshiach throughout every city in which we proclaimed the dvar Hashem to see how they are doing."
44,15,37,"And Bar-Nabba was deciding to take along also Yochanan called Markos."
44,15,38,"But Rav Sha'ul was insisting not to take along this one, the one having withdrawn from them from Pamphylia and not having gone with them to the avodas kodesh work of the Moshiach's Shlichut."
44,15,39,"And there was a sharp disagreement so that they were separated from one another, and Bar-Nabba took Markos and sailed away to Cyprus."
44,15,40,"And Rav Sha'ul chose Sila and departed, having been commended to the Chen v'Chesed Hashem by the Achim b'Moshiach."
44,15,41,"And they were traveling through Syria and Cilicia strengthening the Moshiach's Kehillot."
44,16,1,"And Rav Sha'ul arrived also in Derbe and went on to Lystra.  And, hinei, a certain talmid of Moshiach was there by the name Timotiyos, the ben of a faithful Yiddisha isha but whose abba was Yevani."
44,16,2,"Timotiyos was a bochur who was well spoken of by the Achim b'Moshiach in Lystra and Iconium."
44,16,3,"Rav Sha'ul wanted Timotiyos to come along with his company, so he took him and did a Bris Milah, because of the Yehudim in those places, for everyone had da'as that his abba was Yevani"
44,16,4,"And as they were traveling through the cities, they were handing on to them to be shomer regarding the mitzvot that had been laid down by the Moshiach's Shluchim and the Ziknei haKehillot of Moshiach in Yerushalayim."
44,16,5,"The Moshiach's Kehillot, therefore, were growing in the emunah"
44,16,6,"And they traveled through the regions of Phrygia and Galatia,  having been forbidden by the Ruach Hakodesh to speak the dvar Hashem in [the Roman Province of] Asia."
44,16,7,"And having come to the border of Mysia, they were trying to go toward Bithynia, and the Ruach of Moshiach did not permit them."
44,16,8,"So, passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas."
44,16,9,"And during the lailah a chazon"
44,16,10,"And when Rav Sha'ul saw the chazon, immediately he sought to cross over to Macedonia, concluding that Hashem had called us to preach the Besuras HaGeulah to them.      LYDIA BECOMES A TALMIDAH OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH AND IS MAKPID"
44,16,11,"And having set sail from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and, on the next day, to Neapolis;"
44,16,12,"and from there, to Philippi, which is a chashuve city of the district of Macedonia, a Roman colony.  And we were in this city, staying some yamim."
44,16,13,"And on Shabbos, we went outside the sha'ar to a river where there was a mikveh mayim, supposing there we would find a minyan davening, and having sat down, we were speaking with the nashim who had assembled."
44,16,14,"And a certain isha, by name Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth,  of the city of Thyatira, a yire Elohim, was listening, and Hashem  opened her lev"
44,16,15,"And when she was given the Moshiach's tevilah of teshuvah along with all her household, she said, If you have judged me ne'emanah to Hashem, enter into my bais and stay there.  And she prevailed upon us.  SHEDIM CAUSE A MATZAV"
44,16,16,"And it came about when we were going to where they held the minyan, that a certain shifchah"
44,16,17,"This one was following Rav Sha'ul, crying out, saying, These anashim are avadim of G-d HaElyon and are proclaiming to you the Derech HaYeshu'at Eloheinu."
44,16,18,"And this kviusdik"
44,16,19,"And when her adonim saw that the tikvah of their profit also left her, they seized Rav Sha'ul and Sila, and they dragged them into the marketplace before their manhigim;"
44,16,20,"and having brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, These anashim, being Jews, are disturbing our city,"
44,16,21,"and they are proclaiming customs which it is not permitted for us, being Romans, to accept nor to do. [Esther 3:8]"
44,16,22,"And the multitude rose up together keneged"
44,16,23,"And having inflicted klop after klop upon these Jewish men, they threw Rav Sha'ul and Sila into the beis hasohar, giving orders to the soher"
44,16,24,"And the soher"
44,16,25,"And about chatzot halailah Rav Sha'ul and Sila were davening and were singing niggunim to Hashem, and the prisoners were listening to them."
44,16,26,"And, suddenly, there came a gevaltike earthquake, so that the beis hasohar was shaken to its foundations, and immediately were opened all delatot and all sharsherot"
44,16,27,"And the soher, having awakened and having seen the delatot of the beis hasohar having been opened, drew his cherev"
44,16,28,"But Rav Sha'ul shouted with a kol gadol, saying, Do no harm to yourself, for we are all here."
44,16,29,"And having asked for lights, he rushed in and, starting to tremble with pachad, he fell down before Rav Sha'ul and Sila."
44,16,30,"Then, leading them outside, the soher said, Rabbotai, what is it necessary for me to do that I may come to Yeshu'at Eloheinu?"
44,16,31,"And Moshiach's Shluchim said, Have emunah in the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua, and you will come to Yeshu'at Eloheinu, you and your bais."
44,16,32,"And they spoke to him the dvar Hashem together with all the ones in his bais."
44,16,33,"And having taken them in that hour of the lailah, the soher  washed their wounds, and at once he was given Moshiach's tevilah of teshuvah, as well as his entire mishpochah."
44,16,34,"After that he led them to tish in his bais, and he set before them ochel, and he with his whole bais had simcha gedolah that they had come to emunah in Hashem."
44,16,35,"And in the boker, the magistrates sent the soterim"
44,16,36,"And the soher reported these words to Rav Sha'ul, saying, The magistrates sent word that you may be released; now, therefore, go and depart in shalom. [Shofetim 18:6]   RAV SHA'UL, NOT WILLING TO PUT UP WITH THE GNAI"
44,16,37,"But Rav Sha'ul said to them, After giving us a public flogging, though we are uncondemned Roman citizens, they threw us into the beis hasohar; and now are they secretly sending us out?  No, indeed!  Let them come themselves and lead us out in public."
44,16,38,"And the soterim reported these words to the magistrates, and the magistrates were afraid, hearing that Rav Sha'ul and Sila were both Romn citizens."
44,16,39,"So the magistrates came, and entreated Rav Sha'ul and Sila, and brought them out, asking them to depart from the city."
44,16,40,"And having come out from the beis hasohar, they came to Lydia, and having seen and encouraged the Achim b'Moshiach of the Kehillah that met in Lydia's bais, Rav Sha'ul and Sila departed."
44,17,1,"Now having passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Rav Sha'ul and Sila came to Thessalonica, where there was a shul."
44,17,2,"And as he did bekvius"
44,17,3,"making a Messianic midrash"
44,17,4,"And some of them were persuaded and were being mishtatef"
44,17,5,"And the Yehudim without emunah, being filled with kinah, and having rounded up from the people of the market the gornisht and the no goodniks, and having formed a mob, were throwing the city into an uproar.  And the crowd was seeking to bring out Moshiach's Shluchim and throw them to the mob, so they attacked the bais of Jason."
44,17,6,"But not having found the Moshiach's Shluchim, they were dragging Jason and some other Achim b'Moshiach to the city manhigim, shouting, These ones, who have been turning the Olam Hazeh upside down, have come here also!"
44,17,7,"And Jason is the one who has received them into his bais!  And all these ones are acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is king other than Caesar, this Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua!"
44,17,8,"And they stirred up the mob and also the city manhigim who heard them saying these things."
44,17,9,"And having taken the bond money from Jason and the rest, they released them.  THE MOSHIACH SHLUCHIM AT BEREA, WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE MORE NOBLE BECAUSE THESE ARE JEWISH PEOPLE WHO DO A FRESH CHAZORA"
44,17,10,"And, immediately during the lailah, the Achim b'Moshiach sent both Rav Sha'ul and Sila to Berea.  When Moshiach's Shluchim  arrived, they joined the minyan in the shul."
44,17,11,"But these Bereans were more noble-minded than the Thessalonians.  The Berean Yehudim received the dvar Hashem with all readiness, yom yom"
44,17,12,"Therefore, many of them became Messianic Jews, and also of the chashuve Yevanim, not a few nashim and anashim came to emunah."
44,17,13,"But when the Yehudim without emunah from Thessalonica realized that also in Berea the dvar Hashem was being proclaimed by Rav Sha'ul, they came also to Berea, agitating and stirring up mobs."
44,17,14,"And immediately, then, the Achim b'Moshiach sent away Rav Sha'ul to go as far as to the sea, but both Sila and Timotiyos remained in Berea."
44,17,15,"Now the ones escorting Rav Sha'ul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving instructions to have Sila and Timotiyos come to Rav Sha'ul in Athens as quickly as possible, the ones escorting him departed.       RAV SHA'UL PREACHING TO THE BATLANIM"
44,17,16,"And awaiting them in Athens, the ruach of Rav Sha'ul was being distressed within him as he observed the city being full of elilim."
44,17,17,"Therefore, Rav Sha'ul was dialoguing and arguing in the shul with the Yehudim and with the yirei Elohim and also in the marketplace yom yom with the ones who happened to be there."
44,17,18,"Also some of the Apikoros"
44,17,19,"And having taken hold of Rav Sha'ul, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying, Are we able to have da'as of what this new teaching is, which is being spoken by you?"
44,17,20,"For some surprising things you bring to our hearing.  Therefore, we desire to have da'as of what these things mean."
44,17,21,"Now all the Athenians and the visiting foreigners and tourists in Athens used to spend time doing nothing but speaking and hearing about the latest novelty in the news."
44,17,22,"And Rav Sha'ul, taking his stand in the middle of the Areopagus, said, Anashim, Athenians, with respect to everything how very religious"
44,17,23,"For passing through and looking carefully at your objects of worship, I found also an altar on which had been inscribed `To the unknown g-d.'  Therefore, what you worship without da'as, this I proclaim to you."
44,17,24,"Hashem, the One having made HaOlam and all the things in it, this One being Adon HaShomayim vaHaAretz, does not dwell in temples made by human hands. [Yeshayah 42:5 Devarim 10:14; Yeshayah 66:1; Melachim Alef 8:27]"
44,17,25,"Nor is Hashem served by human hands, as if Hashem were in need of something, since he gives to all Chayyim and breath and everything. [Tehillim 50:10-12; Yeshayah 42:5]"
44,17,26,"And Hashem made from one ancestor every nation of anashim dwelling pnei kol haAretz.  And Hashem has set the zmanim and the fixed boundaries of their habitations, [Devarim 32:8; Iyov 12:23]"
44,17,27,"so that they would seek G-d, if efsher"
44,17,28,"For `we live in him and in him we move and have our being,' as also some of your poets have said, `For we are all his offspring.' [Devarim 30:20; Iyov 12:10; Daniel 5:23' Epimenides; Aratus]"
44,17,29,"Therefore, being offspring of Hashem, we ought not to think that Hashem's essence is like gold or silver or stone, a tzelem"
44,17,30,"While Hashem has disregarded and let pass the Am HaAretz times, now, however, Hashem proclaims to kol bnei Adam everywhere to make teshuva,  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH IS THE DAYAN"
44,17,31,"because he set a day in which he is about to bring MISHPAT"
44,17,32,"And when they heard of the Techiyas HaMesim, some were mocking Rav Sha'ul.  But others said, We will hear you again about this."
44,17,33,"Thus did Rav Sha'ul go out from the midst of them."
44,17,34,"And some anashim became mishtatef to Rav Sha'ul, in that they had emunah, among whom were both Dionysius, a member of the Athenian Council of the Areopagus, and an isha by name Damaris, and others with them."
44,18,1,"After these things Rav Sha'ul left Athens and went to Corinth."
44,18,2,"And in Corinth Rav Sha'ul found some Messianic Jews, namely  Aquila hailing from Pontus, having recently come from Italy, where Claudius ordered a decree of Jewish expulsion from Rome, and Priscilla, his isha.  Rav Sha'ul went to see them."
44,18,3,"And because he had the same parnasah, Rav Sha'ul was staying  with them, and he was working with them, for they were tentmakers by trade."
44,18,4,"And Rav Sha'ul was debating in the shul every Shabbos, and he was convincing Yehudim and Yevanim."
44,18,5,"Now when both Sila and Timotiyos came down from Macedonia, Rav Sha'ul was farnumen"
44,18,6,"But when some began opposing Rav Sha'ul, and when they began committing Chillul Hashem, Rav Sha'ul shook out his kaftan and said to them, The responsibility of your lot be upon you own head!  For I am tahor"
44,18,7,"And so Rav Sha'ul left them, and entered into the bais of a certain ish by name Titius Justus, a yire Elohim whose bais was right next door to the shul!!"
44,18,8,"And Crispus, the Rosh Beit HaKnesset, came to emunah in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu along with his entire bais; also many of the Corinthians who heard came to emunah, and were being given Moshiach's tevilah of teshuvah."
44,18,9,"Then in the lailah, through a chazon, Adonoi said to Rav Sha'ul, Do not fear, but speak out, and do not keep silent,"
44,18,10,"for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you; I have many people in this city."
44,18,11,"And Rav Sha'ul sat shanah and shishah chodashim saying shiurim to them on the dvar Hashem."
44,18,12,"And when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the [disobedient] Yehudim rose up with one accord keneged"
44,18,13,"saying, This one persuades anashim to worship Hashem in a manner against the Torah."
44,18,14,"Rav Sha'ul was about to open his mouth when Gallio spoke to the Yehudim, If this matter concerned some wrong or heinous crime, O Yehudim, I might reasonably put up with you;"
44,18,15,"but if it is kashes"
44,18,16,"And he had them ejected from the courtroom."
44,18,17,"They seized Sosthenes, the Rosh HaKnesset, and were beating him in full view of the Kes HaMishpat"
44,18,18,"But Rav Sha'ul still remained a number of yamim and then took leave of the Achim b'Moshiach, and was sailing away to Syria; and with him were Priscilla and Aquila.  In Cenchrea he cut his hair, for he had taken a neder. [Bamidbar 6:2,5,18]"
44,18,19,"Then they arrived in Ephesus, and Rav Sha'ul left them there, but he joined the minyan in the shul and debated with the Yehudim."
44,18,20,"And when they were asking Rav Sha'ul to stay for a longer time, he did not give his consent."
44,18,21,"But taking leave of them, he said, I will return again im yirtzeh Hashem"
44,18,22,"And having come down to Caesarea and having gone up and  greeted the [Yerushalayim] Kehillah of Moshiach, then Rav Sha'ul went down to Antioch."
44,18,23,"And having spent some time, he embarked, passing through the area of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the Moshiach's talmidim.  RAV APOLLOS GIVES IMPORTANT MESSIANIC DRASHOT AT EPHESUS AND CORINTH AFTER HE IS REGULARIZED BY PRISCILLA AND AQUILA"
44,18,24,"Now a certain man, a Yehudi, arrived in Ephesus, Apollos by name, hailing from Alexandria, a Lamdan"
44,18,25,"This one had been taught the Derech Hashem and was on fire in the Ruach Hakodesh and saying shiurim and drashot accurate and true to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach.  But Rav Apollos was acquainted only with the tevilah of teshuvah of Yochanan."
44,18,26,"And this rabbi began to speak with ometz lev in the shul.  And having heard him, Priscilla and Aquila took him and more accurately instructed him in the Derech Hashem."
44,18,27,"When Rav Apollos desired to go to Achaia, the Achim b'Moshiach encouraged him and wrote iggrot to Moshiach's talmidim there to welcome him.  When Rav Apollos arrived, he greatly helped the ones who through the Chen v'Chesed Hashem had come to emunah."
44,18,28,"For with ko'ach gadol, Rav Apollos was publicly refuting the [unbelieving] Yehudim, showing through the Kitvei HaKodesh that Yehoshua is the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
44,19,1,"And it came about while Rav Apollos was in Corinth that Rav Sha'ul traveled through the upper regions and arrived at Ephesus, finding some of [Moshiach's] talmidim there."
44,19,2,"And Rav Sha'ul said to them, Did you receive the Ruach Hakodesh when you came to emunah?  But they said to Rav Sha'ul, But we never heard that there is a Ruach Hakodesh!"
44,19,3,"And Rav Sha'ul said, Into what then were you given tevilah?  And they said, Into the tevilah of Yochanan."
44,19,4,"And Rav Sha'ul said, Yochanan gave a tevilah of teshuva to the people, saying that they should have emunah in Hu HaBah [Moshiach], the one coming after him, that is, in Yehoshua."
44,19,5,"And having heard this, they were given Moshiach's tevilah of teshuva in ha-Shem of the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua."
44,19,6,"And when Rav Sha'ul placed his hands upon them, the Ruach Hakodesh came upon them, and they were speaking in leshonot and they were speaking dvarim hanevu'ah."
44,19,7,"And the anashim were about sheneym asar in number."
44,19,8,"And having joined the minyan at the shul, Rav Sha'ul was speaking with ometz lev during the course of shloshah chodashim,  debating and persuading concerning the things of the Malchut Hashem."
44,19,9,"But when some unbelievers in the shul were being hardened and were disobeying, speaking Chillul Hashem of the Derech Hashem before the multitude, Rav Sha'ul withdrew from them.  Rav Sha'ul took the Moshiach's talmidim and yom yom was saying shiurim in the yeshiva of Tyrannus."
44,19,10,"And this happened over a period of shenatayim"
44,19,11,"And gevaltike moftim and niflaot Hashem effected at the hands of Rav Sha'ul,"
44,19,12,"so that when a mitpachat"
44,19,13,"And some travelling Jewish exorcists attempted to use ha-Shem of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua over the ones possessed of ruchot ra'ot, saying, I exorcise and cast you out by the Yehoshua whom Rav Sha'ul preaches!"
44,19,14,"And there were doing this very thing shivat banim of a certain Skeva, a Jewish Kohen Gadol."
44,19,15,"And in reply the ruach hara'ah"
44,19,16,"And the ish in whom was the ruach hara'ah leaped upon them and subdued all [shivah] of them, and overpowered them, so that they fled, naked and wounded, from the bais.  WHEN THE DVAR HASHEM OF REBBE MELECH HAMOSHIACH ARRIVES, THE MAGIC SEGULLOT"
44,19,17,"And this became known to all the Yehudim and also the Yevanim inhabiting Ephesus, and pachad fell upon all of them, and they were exalting ha-Shem of the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua."
44,19,18,"And many of the ones having come to emunah were making vidduy of their ma'asim, disclosing them."
44,19,19,"And a number of the ones who had practiced kishuf"
44,19,20,"So the dvar Hashem, the Besuras HaGeulah, was growing with ko'ach and was prevailing.  THE KUNTZ"
44,19,21,"And when these things were fulfilled, Rav Sha'ul resolved in his ruach to travel through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Yerushalayim, saying After I have gone there, it is necessary for me also to see Rome."
44,19,22,"So Rav Sha'ul sent to Macedonia two of the mesharetim"
44,19,23,"Now during that time there was no small disturbance concerning the Derech Hashem."
44,19,24,"For a certain one, Demetrius by name, a silversmith and maker of silver idol shrines for Artemis, was providing no small revach"
44,19,25,"Demetrius also assembled the craftsmen occupied with that trade and he said, Anashim, you have da'as that our prosperity is from this trade,"
44,19,26,"and you see and hear that not only here in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Rav Sha'ul has persuaded and drawn away a large multitude saying, `Elilim made with human hands are not Elohim. [Devarim 4:28; Tehillim 115:4; Yeshayah 44:10-20; Yirmeyah 10:3-5]"
44,19,27,"And this is a not only a danger to us, that our part, our trade will fall into disrepute, but also the temple of the elah hagedolah Artemis may be considered as nothing, and also may be about to suffer the loss of her majesty, which all Asia and the Olam Hazeh worship."
44,19,28,"And having listened and having become full of ka'as, the idol makers were crying out, saying, Gedolah is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44,19,29,"And the city was filled with tohu"
44,19,30,"And Rav Sha'ul desired to enter into the crowd in the theatre, but the talmidim were not allowing him."
44,19,31,"And also some of the Asiarchs who were his chaverim, sent to him, begging him not to venture into the theater."
44,19,32,"Then some began shouting one thing, some another in the theatre, for the kahal"
44,19,33,"And from the multitude Alexander was pushed forward by Yehudim and some prompted him with shouts, while Alexander waved his hand, wanting to defend himself to the kahal."
44,19,34,"But having known what the man was, that he was a Yehudi"
44,19,35,"And the town clerk, when he had restrained the crowd, said, Anashim, citizens of Ephesus, who indeed is there among bnei Adam who does not have da'as that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the heikhal of the great Artemis and of the tzelem that fell from Shomayim?"
44,19,36,"Since these things are undenible, it is necessary for you to calm down and to do nothing reckless."
44,19,37,"For you brought these anashim here who are neither temple robbers nor speakers of evil against our religion."
44,19,38,"Therefore, if Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a tainah"
44,19,39,"And if you seek anything further, let your settlement be obtained in the lawful assembly."
44,19,40,"For indeed we are in danger of being indicted for an intifadah today, for there is no justification we can render to excuse this disorder and commotion."
44,19,41,"And having said these things, the town clerk dismissed the kahal."
44,20,1,"And after the uproar had ended, Rav Sha'ul summoned the Moshiach's talmidim and, having exhorted them, and having taken his leave, he departed to go to Macedonia."
44,20,2,"And having traveled through those regions and having exhorted the Moshiach's talmidim there with many words, Rav Sha'ul came to Greece."
44,20,3,"And after he had spent shloshah chodashim there, Rav Sha'ul was about to set sail for Syria when a kesher"
44,20,4,"And accompanying Rav Sha'ul from Berea was Sopater the son of Pyrrhus, from Thessalonica was Aristarchus and Secundus, from Derbe, Gaius, and from Asia, Timotiyos, Tychicus and Trophimus."
44,20,5,"And these, having gone ahead, were waiting for us in Troas."
44,20,6,"And we sailed away after the Yamim HaMatzot [i.e. Pesach] from Philippi, and within chamash yamim we came to them in Troas,  where we stayed shivah yamim.  RAV SHA'UL'S FAREWELL VISIT TO TROAS ON MOTZEI SHABBOS; AFTER PARTAKING OF MOSHIACH'S MELAVAH MALKAH MEAL AND DURING A LONG SHIUR, A TALMID FALLS ASLEEP AND TOPPLES TO WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF HIS LIFE, HAD NOT HASHEM THROUGH MOSHIACH'S SHLIACH MADE HIM TO STAND UP ALIVE AGAIN FROM THE DEAD"
44,20,7,"And on Yom Rishon, when we met for a firen tish"
44,20,8,"And there were a number of menorot in the upper story, where we had assembled."
44,20,9,"And a certain bocher, by name Eutychus, was sitting on the window sill and began to succumb to a deep sleep while Rav Sha'ul was lecturing on and on.  Overcome by this sleep, Eutychus fell from the third story downwards, and was picked up dead."
44,20,10,"And having come down, Rav Sha'ul fell upon him, and, having embraced him, Rav Sha'ul said, Do not be troubled, for his neshamah is in him. [Melachim Alef 17:21; Melachim Bais 4:34]"
44,20,11,"And having gone up and, at the Betzi'at HaLechem having partaken of it, and having spoken until Shacharis, thus Rav Sha'ul departed."
44,20,12,"And they led away the bochur chai! And they were not a little comforted.   THE VOYAGE FROM TROAS TO MILETUS"
44,20,13,"And we went ahead to the oniyah"
44,20,14,"When Rav Sha'ul met us in Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene."
44,20,15,"And from there, having sailed away, we arrived on the next day opposite Chios. And then the day following we crossed over to Samos, and, on the following day, we came to Miletus."
44,20,16,"For Rav Sha'ul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so he would not have to spend time in [the Province of] Asia, for he was hurrying in order that, if possible, he might by Shavu'os go up to Yerushalayim.  RAV SHA'UL GIVES A FINAL DERASHA TO THE ZIKNEI HAKEHILLAH OF EPHESUS"
44,20,17,"And from Miletus, having sent to Ephesus, Rav Sha'ul summoned the Ziknei Kehillah."
44,20,18,"And when they came to him, he said to them, You have da'as from the yom harishon in which I set foot in Asia how I was with you the entire time,"
44,20,19,"my avodas kodesh service to Hashem with all anavah"
44,20,20,"how I kept back nothing profitable from you, and but kept giving you messianic drashot and shiurim publicly and from bais   to bais, [Tehillim 40:10; Yirmeyah 26:2; 42:2]"
44,20,21,"bearing solemn edut both to Yehudim and Yevanim about teshuva toward Hashem and emunah in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua."
44,20,22,"And now, hinei, having been bound by the Ruach Hakodesh, I am going to Yerushalayim, not having da'as of the things that are going to happen to me there,"
44,20,23,"except that the Ruach Hakodesh, in every city, testifies to me, saying that the beis hasohar and tzoros are awaiting me."
44,20,24,"But I gufa"
44,20,25,"And now, hinei, I have da'as that no longer will you see my face, all of you among whom I went about preaching the Malchut Hashem."
44,20,26,"Therefore I bear solemn edut"
44,20,27,"For I did not shrink back from preaching and disclosing to all of you the whole etzat Hashem"
44,20,28,"Pay attention to yourselves and to all the eder Hashem"
44,20,29,"I have da'as that after my departure savage ze'evim"
44,20,30,"And from you yourselves will rise up anashim speaking perverted doctrines in order to draw away talmidim after themselves."
44,20,31,"Therefore, be shomer, remembering that for shloshah shanim, yomam v'lailah, I did not stop admonishing each one of you with tears."
44,20,32,"And now I commend you to Hashem and to the Dvar HaChen v'Chesed Hashem which is able to build you up and give you nachalah among all the kedoshim."
44,20,33,"I coveted no one's silver or gold or shtraymel. [Shmuel Alef 12:3]"
44,20,34,"You yourselves have da'as that these hands of mine supported all my needs as well as the needs of those with me."
44,20,35,"In all this I was showing you a mofet"
44,20,36,"And having said these things, Rav Sha'ul fell down and, with them all, began davening."
44,20,37,"And there was much weeping among them, and, having fallen upon the neck of Rav Sha'ul, they were kissing him,"
44,20,38,"with agmat nefesh above all at the dvar in which Rav Sha'ul had said that no longer would they see his face again. And they were accompanying him to the oniyah."
44,21,1,"And when it came about that we set sail, having parted from them, having run a straight course, we came to Cos.  And on the next day we got to Rhodes, and from there to Patara."
44,21,2,"And having found an oniyah crossing over to Phoenicia, we went on board and set sail."
44,21,3,"And having come within sight of Cyprus, and leaving Cyprus behind on our left, we were sailing to Syria and we arrived in Tzor, for there the oniyah was unloading its cargo."
44,21,4,"And after having searched for Moshiach's talmidim there, we stayed in Tzor shivah yamim.  And Moshiach's talmidim were telling Rav Sha'ul by the Ruach Hakodesh not to make any aliyah to Yerushalayim."
44,21,5,"But when our yamim there were ended, we departed and everyone, including nashim and yeladim, were accompanying us as far as the outskirts of the city; and falling down on the beach, we all were davening."
44,21,6,"And having bid them Shalom, we embarked in the oniyah, and they returned to their own batim."
44,21,7,"And when we had completed the voyage from Tzor, we arrived in Ptolemais, and, having given a Shalom greeting to the Achim b'Moshiach there, we stayed yom echad with them."
44,21,8,"And on the next day, having left, we came to Caesarea; and  entered the bais of Philippos, the maggid of the Besuras HaGeulah who was one of HaShivah [see 6:3].  And we stayed with him."
44,21,9,"And Philippos was the abba of arbah banot, betulot, who were gifted in giving a dvar nevuah. [Shemot 15:20; Shofetim 4:4; Nechemyah 6:14]"
44,21,10,"And remaining there many yamim, a certain one came down from Yehudah, a navi, Agav by name."
44,21,11,"And when he came to us, he took Rav Sha'ul's gartel and, having bound his own feet and hands with it, Agav said, So says  the Ruach Hakodesh:  this is the way the Yehudim in Yerushalayim will bind the man who owns this gartel, and they will hand him over to the Goyim. [Melachim Alef 22:11; Yeshayah 20:2-4; Yirmeyah 13:1-11]"
44,21,12,"And when we heard these things, we were begging Rav Sha'ul, both we and the locals, not to make any aliyah to Yerushalayim."
44,21,13,"Then Rav Sha'ul answered, What are you doing weeping and breaking my lev"
44,21,14,"And not persuading him, we remained silent, having said, Let the ratzon Hashem be done."
44,21,15,"And after these yamim, having made preparations, we were making an aliyah to Yerushalayim."
44,21,16,"And also some of Moshiach's talmidim from Caesarea travelled with us, bringing us for hachnosas orchim to the bais of the Cyprian Mnason, one of Moshiach's talmidim of long standing [an early disciple].     RAV SHA'UL, WHO RECEIVED S'MICHAH FROM RABBAN GAMLI'EL, VISITS YA'AKOV THE SHLIACH TO THE YEHUDIM; THE ORTHODOX MESSIANIC RABBIS OF  ORTHODOX MESSIANIC JUDAISM INSTRUCT RAV SHA'UL THAT, ALTHOUGH RIGHTLY HE HAS NOT TRIED TO MAKE THE GOYIM IN HIS MINISTRY KEEP ALL THE SINAI COVENANT MITZVOT"
44,21,17,"And when we arrived in Yerushalayim, the Achim b'Moshiach there gave us a kabbalat panim with lev same'ach."
44,21,18,"And on the following day Rav Sha'ul was going in with us to Ya'akov, and all the Ziknei HaKehillah came. MOSHIACH'S SHLIACH TO THE NATIONS, RAV SHA'UL, SUBMITS HIS MINISTRY TO REBBE, MELECH MOSHIACH'S GEDOLEI YISRAEL IN YERUSHALAYIM AND OBEYS THEIR ADMONITIONS LEST ANYONE MISINTERPRET RAV SHA'UL'S WORK AMONG THE GOYIM; HERE RAV SHA'UL PROVES THAT THE HARD CENTER OF HIS"
44,21,19,"And having given them a Shalom greeting, Rav Sha'ul was explaining one by one the things Hashem did through his avodas kodesh as Moshiach's Shliach to the Goyim."
44,21,20,"And the ones who heard were saying, Baruch Hashem! And they said to him, You see, Ach b'Moshiach, how many thousands there are among the Yehudim who have emunah [in our Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua], and they all have kanous"
44,21,21,"And these Orthodox Jewish ma'aminim hameshichiyim have heard a rumor informing them about you, that you teach the Yehudim living among the Goyim in the Golus to be shmad and to commit apostasy from Orthodox Judaism, telling them to abandon Bris Milah for Bnei Yisroel and not to be shomer regarding the darkhei haTorah [Sinai Covenant and its mitzvot]. [Bamidbar 6:2,5]"
44,21,22,"What then is to be done?  Certainly these Orthodox Jewish ma'aminim hameshichiyim [who have emunah in our Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshu, Act 21:20] will get word that you have come."
44,21,23,"This, therefore, do, what we tell you. There are with us arba'ah anashim who are under a neder Nezirim."
44,21,24,"Go! Take these for hitkadeshut"
44,21,25,"And concerning the Goyim coming to [Orthodox Jewish] emunah, we have sent an iggeret with our decision that they avoid what is offered to elilim and dahm and what is strangled and zenut."
44,21,26,"Then Rav Sha'ul took the anashim on the following day, and he went with them for hitkadeshut"
44,21,27,"Now when the shivat yamim were about o be completed, unbelieving Yehudim from the Province of Asia [Ephesus], having seen Rav Sha'ul in the Beis Hamikdash, were stirring up all the multitude, and they laid their hands on him, [Yirmeyah 26:8]"
44,21,28,"crying out, Anashim, Bnei Yisroel, help us! This one is the ish who is giving shiurim to everyone everywhere keneged"
44,21,29,"(For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Rav Sha'ul and they had jumped to the conclusion and made the unwarranted assumption that Rav Sha'ul had brought Trophimus past the Soreg"
44,21,30,"And the whole city was aroused and the people were rushing  together, and they seized Rav Sha'ul, and they were dragging him outside the Beit Hamikdash; and immediately the delatot were shut."
44,21,31,"And while they were trying to kill him, a report went up to tribune of the Roman cohort that all Yerushalayim was in an uproar."
44,21,32,"At once he took his chaiyalim and centurions and ran down to them, and when the rioters saw the Roman tribune and the chaiyalim, they stopped beating Rav Sha'ul."
44,21,33,"Then the Roman tribune came near and took hold of Rav Sha'ul and ordered him to be bound with two sharsherot"
44,21,34,"Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, some another, and the tribune was not able to have da'as of anything definite because of the noise, so he ordered him to be brought into the barracks."
44,21,35,"And when Rav Sha'ul was on the steps, it came about that he was carried by the chaiyalim, because of the violence of the multitude,"
44,21,36,"for the crowd kept following and shouting, Away with him!   RAV SHA'UL MAKES HIS HITSTADDEKUT"
44,21,37,"And just when he was about to be brought into the barracks, Rav Sha'ul says to the Roman tribune, Is it is permissible for me to say something to you?  And the tribune said, Ellinisti Ginoskeis?"
44,21,38,"Then you are not the Egyptian who  recently stirred up and intifada and led out four thousand assasins into the wilderness?"
44,21,39,"And Rav Sha'ul said, I gufa"
44,21,40,"And when the tribune had given permisison, Rav Sha'ul stood on the steps and motioned with his hand to the people. And a great silence came.  Then Rav Sha'ul addressed them in the language of the Hebrews."
44,22,1,"Rav Sha'ul said, Anashim, Achim, Avot, listen now to my hitstaddekut."
44,22,2,"And when they heard that Rav Sha'ul was addressing them in the language of the Hebrews, they were even more quiet. And Rav Sha'ul said,"
44,22,3,"I am an ish Yehudi, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but having been brought up in a yeshiva in this city of Yerushalayim at the feet of Rabban Gamliel, having learned with irreproachable frumkeit according to all machmir chumra strictness the Torah of Avoteinu, and I have a kinat Hashem just as all of you do today; [Melachim Alef 19:10]"
44,22,4,"I brought redifah on this `Derech,' even to the point of mavet, binding and delivering both anashim and nashim over to the beis hasohar,"
44,22,5,"as even the Kohen Gadol and all the Zekenim of the Sanhedrin could give solemn edut for me.  For from them I also was authorized with iggrot to the Achim in Damascus, and I was going there to lead away also the ones who were there to bring them bound back to Yerushalayim to have them punished. RAV SHA'UL TELLS HOW HE BECAME MEKABEL REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH"
44,22,6,"And it happened to me while traveling and drawing near to Damascus, lav davka"
44,22,7,"and I fell to the ground.  Then I heard a kol saying to me,  `Sha'ul, Sha'ul, why are you bringing redifah on me?'"
44,22,8,"And I answered, `Who are you, Adoni?'  And he said to me, `I am Yehoshua of Natzeret, upon whom you are bringing redifah.'"
44,22,9,"And the ones with me saw the ohr"
44,22,10,"And I said, `What may I do, Adoni?'  And Rebbe, Melech  HaMoshiach Adoneinu said to me, `Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about everything which has been appointed for you to do.'"
44,22,11,"And because I had been blinded from the kavod"
44,22,12,"A certain man, Chananyah by name, a frumeh Yidden Jew, charedi according to the Torah and with a shem tov with all the Yehudim living in Damascus,"
44,22,13,"came to me and stood next to me, saying, `Ach b'Moshiach Sha'ul, receive your sight.'  And at that moment I looked up at him."
44,22,14,"And he said, `Elohei Avoteinu has chosen and appointed you to have da'as of his ratzon and to see the Tzaddik [Moshiach] and to hear the kol from his mouth."
44,22,15,"`For you will be an eidus"
44,22,16,"`And now what do you intend to do?  Get up and receive Moshiach's tevilah of teshuva and wash away your averos"
44,22,17,"And it happened that after I had returned to Yerushalayim and as was davening in the Beis Hamikdash, that I fell into a trance,"
44,22,18,"and saw Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saying to me, `Hurry and get out quickly from Yerushalayim, because they will not receive your edut"
44,22,19,"And I said `Adoni, they themselves have da'as that in every shul I was imprisoning and beating the ones wiht emunah in you."
44,22,20,"`And when in al kiddush ha-Shem, the dahm of your eidus"
44,22,21,"And Moshiach said to me, `Go!  For I will send you out, far away to the Goyim.'  RAV SHA'UL AND THE ROMAN TRIBUNE"
44,22,22,"And they were listening to Rav Sha'ul up to the word Goyim; and then they lifted up their kol, saying, Away with such a one from ha'aretz!  He should not be allowed to live!"
44,22,23,"And while they were crying out, while they were throwing off their kaftans and tossing dust into the air, [Shmuel Bais 16:13]"
44,22,24,"the Roman tribune directed him to be brought into the barracks, and ordered him to be examined by the flagellum's scourge, that the tribune might have da'as of the reason for the mob's shouting thus keneged"
44,22,25,"And when the Roman soldiers stretched Rav Sha'ul out with the straps, he said to the centurion who was standing by, If a man is a Roman citizen and uncondemned, it is lawful for you to scourge him?"
44,22,26,"And having heard this, the centurion approached the tribune and reported, saying, What are you about to do?  For this man has Roman citizenship."
44,22,27,"And having approached, the tribune said to Rav Sha'ul, Tell me, are you a Roman?  And Rav Sha'ul said, Etiam. [Latin: Yes, certainly.]"
44,22,28,"And the tribune answered, It cost me a large sum of money for me to acquire my Roman citizenship.  And Rav Sha'ul said, But indeed I have been born a Roman citizen."
44,22,29,"Immediately, then, the ones about to examine him drew back from Rav Sha'ul.  Also the tribune did the same.  For he was afraid, learned that Rav Sha'ul is a Roman and that he had bound him.  RAV SHA'UL BEFORE THE SANHEDRIN"
44,22,30,"And on the next day, desiring to know something definite about why Rav Sha'ul was accused by the Yehudim, the tribune released him and ordered the Rashei Hakohanim and all the Sanhedrin to be assembled.  Then, having brought down Rav Sha'ul, the tribune had him set him before them."
44,23,1,"And as he gazed at the Sanhedrin, Rav Sha'ul said, Anashim, Achim, I have lived before Hashem until this day with a lev tahor."
44,23,2,"And the Kohen Gadol Chananyah ordered the ones standing by Rav Sha'ul to strike his mouth."
44,23,3,"Then Rav Sha'ul said to him, Hashem is about to strike you, you white-washed wall!  You sit judging me according to Torah, and yet in violation of the Torah you command me to be struck?  [Vayikra 19:15; Devarim 25:1,2]"
44,23,4,"And the ones standing by said, Do you revile the Kohen Gadol of Hashem?"
44,23,5,"And Rav Sha'ul said, I was without da'as, Achim, that he is the Kohen Gadol, for it has been written, NASI V'AMMECHA LO TA'OR (A ruler of your people you will not speak evil of, Shemot 22:27"
44,23,6,"And Rav Sha'ul, having da'as that one kat is of Tzedukim"
44,23,7,"Now when Rav Sha'ul said this, there came about a machaloket"
44,23,8,"Loit"
44,23,9,"And there was a kol gadol and some of the Sofrim of the kat of the Perushim were arguing vigorously, saying, Nothing rah do we find keneged"
44,23,10,"And fearing much more machaloket was coming, the Roman tribune ordered the troops to go down to take Rav Sha'ul away from the midst of them and to bring him into the barracks, lest he be torn to pieces by them."
44,23,11,"And on the following lailah, HaAdon stood by Rav Sha'ul and said, Chazzak!  For as you gave solemn edut about me in Yerushalayim, thus it is necessary for you also to bear solemn edut"
44,23,12,"In the boker, the Judeans joined in a kesher"
44,23,13,"Now there were more than arba'im anashim"
44,23,14,"After they approached the Rashei haKohanim"
44,23,15,"Now therefore you with the Sanhedrin notify the tribune so that he may bring Rav Sha'ul down to you as if intending to determine more accurately the things concerning him, and, before he draws near, we are ready to kill him."
44,23,16,"Now when Rav Sha'ul's achyon"
44,23,17,"And Rav Sha'ul summoned one of the centurions and said, Bring this bochur to the tribune for he has something to report to him."
44,23,18,"So the centurion took the bocher and brought him to the tribune and says, The prisoner Rav Sha'ul has summoned me and asked me to bring this bochur to you; he has something to say to you."
44,23,19,"The tribune grasped the bochur's hand and drew him aside privately, inquiring, What is it you have to report to me?"
44,23,20,"And the bochur said, The Judeans agreed to ask you to bring Rav Sha'ul down machar"
44,23,21,"Therefore, you should not be persuaded by them, for more than arba'im anashim are lying in wait for him and these took a shevu'ah upon themselves neither to eat nor to drink until they have assassinated him,and now they are ready, waiting for your consent."
44,23,22,"Therefore, the tribune dismissed the bochur, ordering him, Tell no one that you reported these things to me. RAV SHA'UL SENT TO FELIX THE MOSHEL"
44,23,23,"And having summoned two of the centurions, the tribune said, Prepare to leave for Caesarea by nine o'clock tonight the following:  two hundred chaiyalim; seventy horsemen; and two hundred bowmen."
44,23,24,"And also provide mounts for Rav Sha'ul to ride, that he may be given safe passage to Felix the Moshel."
44,23,25,"Then the tribune wrote an iggeret to this effect:"
44,23,26,"Claudius Lysias to the most excellent Moshel, Felix. Greetings."
44,23,27,"This man was seized by the Judeans and was about to be killed by them, but when I learned that he is a Roman citizen, I came with the chaiyalim and rescued him."
44,23,28,"Desiring to have da'as of the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin."
44,23,29,"I found he was being accused about issues of their Torah and the charge was nothing worthy of mavet or of imprisonment."
44,23,30,"And when I received information of a kesher"
44,23,31,"Therefore, as they were ordered, the chaiyalim took Rav Sha'ul along and brought him under cover of lailah to Antipatris."
44,23,32,"And mimacharah"
44,23,33,"When the horsemen entered into Caesarea, they delivered the iggeret to the Moshel and also presented Rav Sha'ul to him."
44,23,34,"And having read it, and having asked from what province Rav Sha'ul hailed, the Moshel learned that he was from Cilicia."
44,23,35,"I will give you a hearing, Felix said, when also your accusers arrive.  The the Moshel commanded Rav Sha'ul to be watch by shomrim in the Praetorium of Herod."
44,24,1,"And after chamash yamim, the Kohen Gadol Chananyah came down  with some Zekenim and an orator, a certain Tertullus, who explained to the Moshel the charges keneged"
44,24,2,"And when Rav Shaul had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Your Excellency, much shalom has been attained through you, and reforms have come to this nation by your foresight."
44,24,3,"This in every way and everywhere, we acknowledge, most excellent Felix, with todah rabbah."
44,24,4,"But in order that I may not detain you any longer, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly."
44,24,5,"For having found this man a troublemaker and an inciter of riots among all the Yehudim throughout kol ha'aretz, a manhig of the kat [of Judaism], the Natzrati Kat."
44,24,6,"He even tried to desecrate the Beis Hamikdash!  And so we apprehended him."
44,24,7,"missing fehlt/missing"
44,24,8,"When you examine him, you will be able to find out yourself regarding all these things of which we accuse him."
44,24,9,"And the rest of the Judeans joined in the attack, saying that these things were so.  RAV SHA'UL MAKES HIS HITSTADDEKUT BEFORE FELIX"
44,24,10,"And when the Moshel nodded to him to speak, Rav Sha'ul answered, Knowing that for many years you have been a shofet"
44,24,11,"You will be able to learn that not more than twelve days have elapsed since I made an aliyah to worship in Yerushalayim."
44,24,12,"And neither in the Beis Hamikdash did they find me conversing with anyone nor did they find me stirring up the multitude either in the shuls or anywhere in Yerushalayim."
44,24,13,"Nor are they able to prove to you concerning the things of which now they are accusing me."
44,24,14,"For Ani modeh this to you, that according to the Derech Hashem, which they call a `kat' [Judaism], I serve the Elohei Avoteinu, having emunah in everything written according to the Torah and the Nevi'im."
44,24,15,"I have a tikvah"
44,24,16,"In view of this, I always do my best to keep a matzpun naki"
44,24,17,"Now after many years, I came bringing nedavot"
44,24,18,"And this is how they found me, having undergone hitkadeshut in the Beis Hamikdash, not with rioters nor with any disturbance."
44,24,19,"But there were some Yehudim from the Province of Asia who ought to be present before you to make accusation, if they might have something against me."
44,24,20,"Or let these themselves say what crime they found in me when they stood me before the Sanhedrin,"
44,24,21,"unless it is about this one statement, which I stood and cried out among them, and that statement was concerning the Techiyas HaMesim, and it is for this that I am being judged today by you."
44,24,22,"But Felix, who was already rather well informed about the Derech Hashem, adjourned the meeting, saying, When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case."
44,24,23,"Then Felix gave orders to the centurion to guard Rav Sha'ul, but to grant him considerable liberty and not to prevent his chaverim from ministering to his needs.    RAV SHA'UL HELD IN CUSTODY"
44,24,24,"And after some yamim, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was Jewish.  He summoned Rav Sha'ul and listened to him concerning his emunah"
44,24,25,"And as Rav Sha'ul was conversing about tzedek [Daniel 9:25] and kibush hayetzer"
44,24,26,"At the same time Felix was also hoping that bribe money would be given to him by Rav Sha'ul.  Therefore, Felix used to frequently send for Rav Sha'ul to converse with him."
44,24,27,"And shenatayim"
44,25,1,"Therefore Festus, having arrived in the Province, after shloshah yamim went up to Yerushalayim from Caesarea,"
44,25,2,"and the Rashei Hakohanim and manhigim explained to Festus the Rashei Hakohanim and the leading anashim of the Yehudim the charges keneged Rav Sha'ul, and they were begging him,"
44,25,3,"asking a favor from him, that Festus might summon Rav Sha'ul to Yerushalayim, while at the same time they were forming a kesher to kill him along the way."
44,25,4,"Therefore, Festus answered that Rav Sha'ul was to be kept in Caesarea and that Festus himself intended quickly to go there."
44,25,5,"Therefore those in authoriy among you, Festus says, should come down with me, and if there is anything in the wrong about Rav Sha'ul, then let them bring charges against him."
44,25,6,"And having stayed with them no more than shmonah asarah yamim, Festus went down to Caesarea; the next day he sat on the Kes HaMishpat and ordered Rav Sha'ul to be brought in."
44,25,7,"When Rav Sha'ul came in, the Judeans who had come down from Yerushalayim stood around him and brought serious charges keneged"
44,25,8,"Rav Sha'ul defended himself, saying, Neither keneged the Torah nor keneged the Beis Hamikdash nor keneged Caesar have I done anything wrong."
44,25,9,"But Festus, wishing to grant the Judeans a favor, said in reply to Rav Sha'ul, Do you want to go up to Yerushalayim to be judged by me there concerning these things?"
44,25,10,"And Rav Sha'ul said, I am standing before the Kes HaMishpat of Caesar, where it is necessary for me to be tried.  I have done no wrong to my Jewish people, as you also have da'as very well."
44,25,11,"No, if I have done wrong and am worthy of mavet, I am not trying to escape the death penalty. But if there is nothing to the charges these ones bring against me, no one is able to hand me over to them.  Therefore, I appeal to Caesar."
44,25,12,"Then Festus, having talked with his council, answered, To Caesar you have appealed, to Caesar you will go.  RAV SHA'UL BEFORE AGRIPPA HAMELECH AND BERNICE"
44,25,13,"After several yamim had passed, Agrippa HaMelech and Bernice arrived in Caesarea, having paid their respects to Festus."
44,25,14,"And while they were spending many yamim there, Festus laid out to the Melech the things with respect to Rav Sha'ul, saying, There is a man here who was left behind in the beis hasohar by Felix."
44,25,15,"When I went to Yerushalayim, the Rashei Hakohanim and the Zekenim of the Yehudim informed me about this man, requesting keneged him a sentence of condemnation."
44,25,16,"I answered them that it violated Roman law to hand over any man before the accused met face to face with his accusers and had an opportunity for a defense concerning the accusation."
44,25,17,"Therefore, they were assembled here; I allowed no delay, and on the next day, I sat down on the Kes HaMishpat and ordered the man brought in."
44,25,18,"But when the accusers stood up, no charge were they bringing of any crimes I was expecting."
44,25,19,"Instead it was an internal matter having to do wiht questions regarding Orthodox Judaism, and certain disagreements they had with Rav Sha'ul, and regarding a certain Yehoshua who was niftar, but whom Rav Sha'ul asserted was alive."
44,25,20,"Since I was not qualified to investigate these religious questions, I was saying he might wish to go to Yerushalayim and there to be judged concerning these things."
44,25,21,"But Rav Sha'ul appealed that he be kept in custody for the decision of Caesar, so I ordered him to be kept until I send him to Caesar."
44,25,22,"And Agrippa said to Festus, I was desiring also myself to hear Rav Sha'ul.  Then Festus says, Tomorrow you will hear him."
44,25,23,"Then on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered into the auditorium along with both the military tribunes and the chashuve anashim of Caesarea.  And Festus the Moshel gave orders to have Rav Sha'ul brought in."
44,25,24,"And Festus says, Agrippa HaMelech and all here present with us, you see this man about whom K'lal Yisroel has petitioned me, both in Yerushalayim and here, shouting that he is no longer fit to live."
44,25,25,"But I found he has done nothing worthy of mavet, and when he appealed to Caesar, I decided to send him."
44,25,26,"But I have nothing definite to write to our sovereign; therefore, I especially brought him before you, O Agrippa HaMelech, so that, after you have examined him, I may have something I may write."
44,25,27,"For it seems unreasonable to me sending a prisoner and not having charges to report against him."
44,26,1,"And Agrippa said to Rav Sha'ul, It is permitted for you to speak concerning yourself.  Then Rav Sha'ul, having stretched out his hand, was making his hitstaddekut, saying,"
44,26,2,"I have considered myself fortunate that it is before you, Agrippa HaMelech, that I am able to make my hitstaddekut today concerning everything of which I am accused by Yehudim."
44,26,3,"Most of all, you are a bukki"
44,26,4,"All the Yehudim have da'as of my Yiddishkeit from my earliest youth, a life spent from the beginning among my own people and in Yerushalayim."
44,26,5,"They have had da'as of this for a long time, if they are willing to bear edut"
44,26,6,"And now I stand here on trial on account of my tikvah in the havtacha made to Avoteinu,"
44,26,7,"a havtacha the Sheneym Asar Shevateinu have tikvah to attain, as they with earnestness worship Hashem yomam valailah.  It if for this tikvah, your Excellency, that I am accused by Yehudim!"
44,26,8,"Why is it considered incredible by any of you that Hashem makes the Mesim to stand up alive?"
44,26,9,"Indeed, I myself thought it necessary to do many opposing things against ha-Shem of Yehoshua from Natzeret."
44,26,10,"And this I also did in Yerushalayim; and armed with samchut received from the Rashei Hakohanim, many of the kedoshim I  locked up in the beis hasohar;  and I cast my vote keneged"
44,26,11,"And throughout all the shuls I often punished them, forcing them to commit Chillul Hashem gidduf, and since I was so enraged against them, I was bringing redifah on them even as far as foreign cities.  RAV SHA'UL TELLS OF HIS EXPERIENCE OF BEING MEKABEL REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH"
44,26,12,"This it was that as I was traveling to Damascus with authorization and permission from the Rashei Hakohanim,"
44,26,13,"at tzohorayim"
44,26,14,"And all of fell down to the ground. Then I heard a kol saying to me in the language of the Hebrews, `Sha'ul, Sha'ul, why are you bringing redifah upon me?  It is hard for to kick keneged"
44,26,15,"And I said, `Who are you Adoni?'  And HaAdon said, `I am Yehoshua upon whom you are bringing redifah."
44,26,16,"`But get up and stand on your feet.  For this tachlis, then, I appeared to you, to give you s'michah as a mesharet, an eved, and an eidus"
44,26,17,"`I will deliver you from your own people and from the Goyim to whom I am sending you, [Yirmeyah 1:8,19]"
44,26,18,"`to open their eyes, to turn them from choshech to ohr and from the samchut of Hasatan to Hashem, that they receive selichat avon and nachalah among the ones having been set apart in kedusha by emunah in me.' [Yeshayah 35:5; Tehillim 18:28; Yeshayah 42:7,16]   RAV SHA'UL'S SOLEMN EDUT TO YEHUDIM AND GOYIM"
44,26,19,"O Agrippa HaMelech, I was not disobedient to the chazon from Shomayim. [Yeshayah 50:5]"
44,26,20,"But beginning with the ones in Damascus and also with those in Yerushalayim, and with all the region of Yehudah and with the Goyim, I was preaching they should make teshuva and turn to Hashem, doing ma'asin mitzvot worthy of teshuva. [Yirmeyah 18:11; 35:15]"
44,26,21,"Because of these things, the unbelieving Yehudim seized me while I was in the Beis Hamikdash, and were trying to kill me."
44,26,22,"To this day I have obtained ezer"
44,26,23,"that is, the innuyim"
44,26,24,"And while he was saying these things in his hitstaddekut, Festus in a kol gadol shouts, Rav Sha'ul, all your yeshiva learning has made you meshuga!"
44,26,25,"But Rav Sha'ul says, I am not meshuga, most excellent Festus; I am speaking dvarim of Emes and Ta'am"
44,26,26,"For HaMelech has da'as of these matters, to whom also I am speaking freely, for I am sure that absolutely none of these things escape his notice, for this has not been done in a corner."
44,26,27,"Agrippa HaMelech, do you believe in the Nevi'im?  I have da'as that you do believe."
44,26,28,"And Agrippa said to Rav Sha'ul, You think, do you, that as quick as that you can make me mekabel Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach?"
44,26,29,"But Rav Sha'ul said, I would daven that Hashem, quickly or not, might make not only you but all listening to me today as I am, apart from these kevalim"
44,26,30,"HaMelech and the Moshel and Bernice and the ones sitting with them got up."
44,26,31,"And having withdrawn, they were speaking to one another, saying, This man does nothing worthy of the death penalty or imprisonment."
44,26,32,"And Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been released, if he had not appealed to Caesar."
44,27,1,"And when it was decided that we set sail to Italy, they were handing over both Rav Sha'ul and some other prisoners to a centurion, Julius by name, of the Imperial Cohort."
44,27,2,"And having embarked in an oniyah of Adramyttium about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we set sail, Aristarchus a Macedonian of Thessalonica being with us."
44,27,3,"And on another day, we put in at a harbor in Tzidon; and Julius treated Rav Sha'ul with kindness, permitting him to be cared for by his chaverim."
44,27,4,"And from there, having put out to sea, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us."
44,27,5,"Then having sailed across the open sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down to Myra of Lycia."
44,27,6,"And there the centurion found an Alexandrian oniyah sailing to Italy and put us on board."
44,27,7,"But for many yamim we sailing slowly and with difficulty  along the coast of Cnidus, and as the wind was not permitting us to go vaiter"
44,27,8,"And with difficulty sailing past it, we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea."
44,27,9,"And since considerable zman"
44,27,10,"saying to them, Anashim, I see that the voyage will be hardship and much peril, not only of the cargo and the oniyah, but also of our lives."
44,27,11,"But the centurion was persuaded by the pilot and the owner  rather than by the dvarim of Rav Sha'ul."
44,27,12,"But the port being unfavorably situated for spending the winter, the majority made a decision to set sail from there, if somehow they could reach Phoenix to spend the winter.  It was a harbor of Crete, facing toward the southwest and toward the northwest. A STORM AT SEA NECESSARY TO VINDICATE RAV SHA'UL AS A NAVI AND A TRUSTWORTHY SPIRITUAL NAVIGATOR AND TO SHOW EVERYONE THEIR NEED FOR A MAGGID WITH REAL BESURAS HAGEULAH"
44,27,13,"And a gentle south wind began to blow, and they thought they could attain their mattarah"
44,27,14,"After not much time a violent, typhoon force wind rushed down from Crete, the so-called Euraquilo, the Northeaster."
44,27,15,"And the oniyah, having been caught in it, and not being able to directly face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven."
44,27,16,"By running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able only with difficulty to get the lifeboat secured."
44,27,17,"After hoisting it up, they were using frapping cables, passing them underneath the oniyah; then, fearing lest on the shallows of Syrtis they might run aground, they lowered the sea anchor, and so they were being driven along."
44,27,18,"And we were being violently tossed by the storm, so much so that the next day they were throwing the cargo overboard."
44,27,19,"And on the Yom Shlishi, with their own hands, they threw out the tackle of the oniyah."
44,27,20,"And neither shemesh"
44,27,21,"And after having much loss of appetite, then Rav Sha'ul stood up in the midst of them, and said, Anashim, you should have obeyed me and not put out to sea from Crete and thereby spared yourselves this hardship and this loss."
44,27,22,"And now I advise you to have ometz lev, for there will be no loss of life among you, except the oniyah."
44,27,23,"For a malach Hashem stood by me during lailah hazeh, of the  G-d whom I serve,"
44,27,24,"saying, `Do not be afraid, Sha'ul, it is necessary for you to stand before Caesar; and, hinei, Hashem has given to you all the ones sailing with you.'"
44,27,25,"Therefore have lev same'ach, Anashim. For I have emunah in Hashem that it will be exactly as he has told me."
44,27,26,"But it is necessary for us to run aground on some island."
44,27,27,"Now when the fourteenth night had come, while we being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, toward chatzot halailah, the sailors were suspecting that we were getting close to land."
44,27,28,"And having taken soundings, they found twenty fathoms and, having sailed a little vaiter"
44,27,29,"And fearing lest somehow against the rough places we might run aground, they threw four anchors off the stern, and they were davening for the dawn."
44,27,30,"Now when the sailors sought to flee from the oniyah and to let down the lifeboat into the sea on the pretext of casting out anchors,"
44,27,31,"Rav Sha'ul said to the centurion and to the chaiyalim, Unless these remain in the oniyah, you cannot be saved."
44,27,32,"Then the chaiyalim cut away the ropes of the lifeboat, and let it fall away, setting it adrift."
44,27,33,"Just before boker, Rav Sha'ul was urging everyone to take ochel"
44,27,34,"Therefore, I encourage you to take ochel, for it is for your deliverance, for none of you will lose a hair from your heads."
44,27,35,"And having said these things, and having taken lechem, Rav Sha'ul said the HaMotzi before all, and, after the betzi'at halechem, he began to eat."
44,27,36,"And receiving ometz lev, they all took ochel."
44,27,37,"Now were in all two hundred and seventy-six nefashot in the oniyah."
44,27,38,"And having eaten enough ochel"
44,27,39,"And when it became day, they were not recognizing the land, but a certain bay they were noticing, having a shore onto which they were wanting, if possible, to run aground the oniyah."
44,27,40,"And the anchors they cast off and they left them in the sea. At the same time they loosened the ropes of the rudders and raised the sail to the wind and were steering toward the shore."
44,27,41,"But having fallen into a channel, a place between two seas, they ran the oniyah aground, and, while the bow had stuck and remained immovable, the stern was being destroyed by the force of the waves."
44,27,42,"Now the cheshbon"
44,27,43,"But the centurion, desiring to save Rav Sha'ul, kept them from carrying out the cheshbon, and he ordered the ones able to swim to throw themselves overboard rishonim and make for the shore."
44,27,44,"And the rest, some on planks, others on pieces from the oniyah.  And so it came about that everyone was brought safely onto the land."
44,28,1,"And having been brought safely through, we then found out that the island is called Malta."
44,28,2,"And the natives were showing not the ordinary kindness to us for, because of the geshem that had set in and because of the cold, they lit a hadlakah"
44,28,3,"And when Rav Sha'ul gathered some brushwood and placed the sticks on the hadlakah"
44,28,4,"And when the natives saw it hanging from his hand, they were saying to one another, Surely this man is a rotzeach"
44,28,5,"Then, having shaken off the nachash into the aish"
44,28,6,"But the natives were expecting him to be about to swell up or suddenly to fall down.  But they watched him expectantly for a long time, and when they observed nothing unusual happening to him, they changed their minds and were saying that he was a g-d."
44,28,7,"Now in the area around that place were lands belonging to the gontser macher of the island, Publius by name, who welcomed us and gave us hachnosas orchim."
44,28,8,"And it came about that the abba of Publius was bedfast, suffering fevers and dysentery;  Rav Sha'ul approached him, and having davened, laid his hands on him and administered refuah shleimah to him."
44,28,9,"And when this happened, also the the rest on the island, the cholim were approaching Rav Sha'ul and were receiving refuah shleimah."
44,28,10,"The natives bestowed mattanot rabbot on us and, while being put out to sea, they gave us the provisions for our needs. [Tehillim 15:4]  RAV SHA'UL ARRIVES AT ROME"
44,28,11,"And after shloshah chodashim, we set sail in a oniyah, having spent the winter on the island. It was an Alexandrian oniyah marked by the insignia of the twin Achim."
44,28,12,"And having put in at Syracuse, we stayed shloshah yamim."
44,28,13,"Then we weighed anchor and arrived at Rhegium.  And after one day, southwest wind sprang up and on the second day we came to Puteoli."
44,28,14,"There we found Achim b'Moshiach and we were invited by them to stay shivah yamim.  And so we came to Rome."
44,28,15,"And from there, the Achim b'Moshiach when they heard of us, came out to meet us, even as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns.  On seeing them, ometz lev came to Rav Sha'ul and he said a berakhah, davening hodah to Hashem."
44,28,16,"Now when we entered into Rome, Rav Sha'ul was permitted to live by himself in his own quarters with a chaiyal guarding him. RAV SHA'UL PREACHES REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH TO YEHUDIM IN ROME  AND LUKAS, HAVING SHOWN BY MANY LEGAL PRECEDENTS AND PROOFS THE CONCLUSION OF THE CASE OF HIS HISTORICAL APOLOGETIC, BRINGS US TO HIS THESIS: THAT THE HARD CENTER OF THE FAITH OF THE DERECH [HASHEM], EVEN AS IT REACHES OUT TO THE WHOLE WORLD, IS RUACH HAKODESH-FILLED ORTHODOX JUDAISM IN JERUSALEM AND SO ITS ADHERENTS SHOULD QUALIFY FOR THE PROTECTION OF JULIUS CAESAR'S DECREE OF JUDAISM AS A RELIGIO LICITA"
44,28,17,"And it came about after shloshah yamim, that Rav Sha'ul called together the chashuve Yehudim.  And when they had assembled, Rav Sha'ul was saying to them, Anashim, Achim, though I had done nothing keneged"
44,28,18,"who, having examined me, were desiring to release me, because I had done nothing worthy of the death penalty."
44,28,19,"But when the Yehudim spoke keneged"
44,28,20,"On account of this reason, therefore, I summoned you, to see you and to speak with you since it is for the sake of the tikvah Yisroel that I am wearing this kaval."
44,28,21,"And they said to Rav Sha'ul, We  neither received iggrot about you from Yehudah nor have any of the Achim arrived and reported or spke any lashon hora about you."
44,28,22,"But we desire to hear from you what you think, for lichora"
44,28,23,"And they set a day for him, and they came to him in his lodgings and there were many of them.  And Rav Sha'ul was making a midrash, bearing solemn edut about the Malchut Hashem, and persuading them about Yehoshua from both the Torah of Moshe Rabbenu and from the Nevi'im, from haboker to haerev."
44,28,24,"And some Yehudim were being persuaded by the things being said, but others had no emunah."
44,28,25,"And so they disagreed with one another.  And as they were leaving, Rav Sha'ul said a final dvar.  Rightly the Ruach Hakodesh spoke through Yeshayah HaNavi to your Avot,"
44,28,26,"saying, `Go to this people and say in hearing SHIMU SHAMO'A V'AL TAVINU UR'U RA'O V'AL TEDA'U"
44,28,27,"HASHMEN LEV HAAM HAZEH V'AZNAV HAKHBED V'EDAV HASHA PEN YIREH V'EINAV UVAZNAV YISHMA ULEVAVO YAVIN VASHAV N'RAFA LO (For the heart of this people has become dull and with their ears they scarcely hear and they have closed their eyes lest they should see with their eyes and with their ears may hear and with their heart they may have binah and they may turn and I will heal them. [Tehillim 119:70; Yeshayah 6:9,10]"
44,28,28,"Therefore, let it be known to you that to the GOYIM"
44,28,29,"missing fehlt/missing"
44,28,30,"And he remained an entire shetayim shanim"
44,28,31,"preaching the Malchut Hashem and saying shiurim concerning the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua with all openness and without hindrance."
45,1,1,"From Sha'ul, an eved of Rebbe, Melech haMoshiach Yehoshua, summoned to be a Shliach"
45,1,2,"which Hashem promised beforehand through His Neviim in the Kitvei haKodesh. HAKDOMA"
45,1,3,"The Good News of Redemption of Hashem concerns Ben HaElohim, Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech Moshiach Yehoshua, born from the zera Dovid as far as basar is concerned,"
45,1,4,"but, as far as the Ruach Hakodesh is concerned, appointed to be Ben HaElohim in power by means of the Techiyas HaMesim."
45,1,5,"Through Him and for the kavod of His Name, we have received unmerited Chen v'Chesed Hashem and the Shlichut for the tachlis of bringing about the mishma'at"
45,1,6,"among whom you also are summoned to belong to Rebbe,Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua."
45,1,7,"To all who are in Rome, ahuvei Hashem"
45,1,8,"First of all, Modeh Ani"
45,1,9,"For Hashem 'ed!"
45,1,10,"always making techinnah"
45,1,11,"For I am longing to see you, that I may impart to you some mattanah ruchanit"
45,1,12,"or rather, so that there may be mutual chizzuk"
45,1,13,"Now I do not want you to lack da'as, Achim b'Moshiach of mine, of how I often made plans to come to you, though I have been prevented thus far, in order that I might have some p'ri for Hashem among you as well, just as among the rest of the ethnic peoples."
45,1,14,"I am meshubad"
45,1,15,"Hence my eagerness to preach the Besuras HaGeulah to you who are in Rome as well.             THE POWER OF THE BESURAS HAGEULAH"
45,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of the Besuras HaGeulah.  It is the ko'ach"
45,1,17,"For the Tzedek Olamim, the Tzidkat Hashem"
45,1,18,"For the Charon Af Hashem"
45,1,19,"all anashim who, even though what is knowable about Hashem lies plainly before their eyes"
45,1,20,"For His invisible characteristics from the bri'at haolam"
45,1,21,"because, even though they in actual fact knew G-d, they did not ascribe Him kavod"
45,1,22,"Claiming to be chachamim"
45,1,23,"and traded in the kavod"
45,1,24,"Therefore, G-d"
45,1,25,"they traded in the Emes Hashem"
45,1,26,"For this reason, Hashem"
45,1,27,"Likewise also the males abandoned natural sexual intercourse with the female counterpart and were inflamed with craving for one another, males with males committing what is indecent and receiving back"
45,1,28,"And as far as G-d's worthiness to be recognized by them was concerned, vi-bahlt"
45,1,29,"--filled with all resha, wickedness, chamdanut"
45,1,30,"backbiters, slanderers, haters of G-d, insolent, arrogant, braggarts, contrivers of evil, disobedient to horim"
45,1,31,"--without seychel"
45,1,32,"Although they have known full well the just requirements of Hashem,  his just decree, that is, that those who practice such things are b'nei mavet"
45,2,1,"For this reason, you are without ptur"
45,2,2,"And we know that the mishpat"
45,2,3,"You sir, you who pass judgment on those who practice such things and yet do the same yourself, do you suppose then that you will escape the Mishpat Hashem?"
45,2,4,"Or do you think lightly of the wealth of His nedivut and of His chesed and of His being ERECH APAYIM"
45,2,5,"As a result of your KESHI"
45,2,6,"who will render L'ISH K'MA'A'SEI HU"
45,2,7,"To those who, by zitzfleisch"
45,2,8,"But to those who are self-seeking and who have no mishma'at"
45,2,9,"There will be affliction and distress on every living neshamah who brings about what is ra'a"
45,2,10,"But tiferet and kavod and shalom to everyone who brings about what is haTov"
45,2,11,"For ki ein masso panim im Hashem"
45,2,12,"For as many as have committed averos and sinned lacking the Torah shall also perish lacking the Torah; and as many as have committed averos"
45,2,13,"For it is not the Shomei HaTorah"
45,2,14,"For when Goyim, who have not the Torah, do by nature what the Torah requires, they not having the Torah are the Torah for themselves,"
45,2,15,"in that they demonstrate the Torah at work [YIRMEYAH 31:33], the Torah written in their levavot, their matzpun also bearing witness, while their thoughts bring accusation or even make defense among themselves,"
45,2,16,"in the Yom HaDin"
45,2,17,"But if you are called by the name Yehudi"
45,2,18,"and know His will and approve the things that matter, being instructed from the Torah"
45,2,19,"and being bittachon that you are a moreh derech"
45,2,20,"a rabbinic moreh"
45,2,21,"You, then, who teach another, do you not teach yourself?  You who preach LO TIGNOV"
45,2,22,"You who say, LO TINAF"
45,2,23,"You who boast in the Torah--through lasur min haTorah"
45,2,24,"As it is written, Among the Goyim KOL HAYOM HA-SHEM HAELOHIM MINNO'ATZ (All the day long the Name of G-d is being blasphemed"

45,2,27,"And the naturally uncircumcised ish who is mishma'at to the Torah will arise as a judgment on you.  You!  The very one who through the chumra"
45,2,28,"For the true Yehudi"
45,2,29,"the true Yehudi is so in [Hashem's] hidden way, and true bris milah is of the lev, in the Ruach Hakodesh, not in the chumra"
45,3,1,"What then is the advantage of the Yehudi?  Or what is the value of the bris milah?"
45,3,2,"Much in every way! Beikar, koidem kol"
45,3,3,"So, where does that leave us?  If some have disbelieved, has their lack of emunah annulled the ne'emanut"
45,3,4,"Chas v'shalom"
45,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness brings out and highlights the Tzedek Olamim, the Tzidkat Hashem"
45,3,6,"Chas v'shalom!"
45,3,7,"But if the Emes Hashem"
45,3,8,"Why do we not say, as some speakers of lashon hora slanderously report us to say, Let us do resha that hatov might come of it?  The gezar din"
45,3,9,"What then? Are we"
45,3,10,"as it is written, EIN TZADDIK BA'ARETZ"
45,3,11,"There is none who understands, there is none who seeks out G-d."
45,3,12,"All have turned aside, they have together become worthless; there is none who does good, there is none, not so much as one."
45,3,13,"Their throat is an open grave, they use their tongues to deceive.  The venom of asps is under their lips."
45,3,14,"Whose mouth is full of curses and bitterness."
45,3,15,"Their feet are swift when it comes to shedding blood,"
45,3,16,"ruin and wretchedness are in their ways,"
45,3,17,"and the derech Shalom"
45,3,18,"There is no yirat Shomayim"
45,3,19,"Now we know that whatever the Torah says it says to those under the Torah, in order that every mouth might be stopped and kol HaOlam Hazeh become liable to the Mishpat Hashem."
45,3,20,"For by ma'asei HaTorah"
45,3,21,"But now, apart from the Torah, the Tzedek Olamim, the Tzidkat Hashem"
45,3,22,"that is, the Tzidkat Hashem through emunah in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua to all the ma'aminim.  For there is no distinction."
45,3,23,"For all have sinned and come short of the kavod Hashem"
45,3,24,"They are acquitted and accounted to be YITZDAK IM HASHEM as a matnat Elohim by the unmerited Chen v'Chesed Hashem through the pedut"
45,3,25,"whom G-d set forth as a kapparah"
45,3,26,"in the forbearance of G-d, to vindicate His Tzidkat Hashem"
45,3,27,"Where then is boasting?"
45,3,28,"For we reckon that a man is acquitted and pronounced to be YITZDAK IM HASHEM by emunah"
45,3,29,"Or is Hashem G-d of the Yehudim only?  Is Hashem not also G-d of the Goyim?  Ken, of non-Jews, too,"
45,3,30,"vi-bahlt"
45,3,31,"Does it follow that we abolish Torah and make it invalid through emunah"
45,4,1,"What then shall we say about Avraham Avinu"
45,4,2,"For if Avraham Avinu was accounted to be YITZDAK IM HASHEM and acquitted before Hashem on the basis of ma'a'sei HaTorah"
45,4,3,"For what does the Torah say? Avraham Avinu had emunah"
45,4,4,"Now to him who works, the sachar"
45,4,5,"But to the man who does not work but has emunah"
45,4,6,"As also Dovid speaks of the ma'ashair"
45,4,7,"Blessed/happy are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered over;"
45,4,8,"ASHREY ADAM LO YAKHSHOV HASHEM LO AVON.  Blessed/happy is the one whose sin the L-rd will by no means count."
45,4,9,"This ma'ashair"
45,4,10,"When then was it reckoned?  When Avraham Avinu had the bris milah and was in the state of circumcision or when Avraham Avinu did not have the bris milah and was in the state of uncircumcision?"
45,4,11,"Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision!  And he received the sign"
45,4,12,"and in order that he might be the father of the circumcision to those who are not only anashim of circumcision but also who follow in the footsteps of the emunah"
45,4,13,"For the havtachah"
45,4,14,"For if the people of Torah are yoreshim"
45,4,15,"for the Torah brings about the Charon Af Hashem"
45,4,16,"For this reason the havtachah"
45,4,17,"as it is written, AV HAMON GOYIM N'TATICHA"
45,4,18,"Against tikvah"
45,4,19,"Without weakening in emunah"
45,4,20,"He did not doubt the havtachah Hashem"
45,4,21,"being fully convinced that what Elohim had promised He was able also to do."
45,4,22,"Therefore, VAYACHSHEVEHA LO TZEDAKAH"
45,4,23,"Nor was it written down for his sake alone that it was reckoned to him,"
45,4,24,"but also for us, to whom it is to be reckoned, who believe in Him who raised Yehoshua Adoneinu from the mesim"
45,4,25,"who was handed over for peshaeinu"
45,5,1,"Therefore, having been acquitted and declared to be YITZDAK IM HASHEM"
45,5,2,"through whom also we have haSha'ar laHashem"
45,5,3,"Not only so, but we also glory in tzoros"
45,5,4,"zitzfleisch produces tested character, and tested character produces tikvah."
45,5,5,"And tikvah does not in the end lead to our being meyayesh"
45,5,6,"For while we were still helpless, Moshiach died for the rasha'im"
45,5,7,"For only rarely will some one die for a tzaddik"
45,5,8,"But Hashem demonstrates His ahavah"
45,5,9,"How much more then, having now been acquitted and pronounced to be YITZDAK IM HASHEM"
45,5,10,"For if when we were"
45,5,11,"Not only so, but we also glory in Hashem though Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu, through Whom we have now received the ritztzuy"
45,5,12,"Therefore, just as through one Adam"
45,5,13,"For until"
45,5,14,"Nevertheless, Mavet"
45,5,15,"But the averah"
45,5,16,"And the mattanah"
45,5,17,"For if by the averah"
45,5,18,"So, then, as through the averah of one to all anashim to haresha'ah"
45,5,19,"For as through the disobedience of the one Adam"
45,5,20,"The"
45,5,21,"in order that as Chet"
45,6,1,"What then shall we say?  Are we to persist in Chet"
45,6,2,"Chas v'shalom!  Vi-bahlt"
45,6,3,"Or are you unaware that all we who were given a tevilah in a mikveh mayim"
45,6,4,"So then we were buried with Him through a tevilah unto Mavet, in order that as Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was raised from hamesim"
45,6,5,"For if we have become grown together with the very likeness of His mavet"
45,6,6,"Knowing this, that our old humanity"
45,6,7,"For he who has died is declared free from Chet"
45,6,8,"But if we have died with Moshiach, we believe that we shall also live with Him,"
45,6,9,"knowing that Moshiach, having been raised from the mesim"
45,6,10,"For the Mavet he died, he died to chet"
45,6,11,"So also you must reckon yourselves mesim"
45,6,12,"Therefore, do not let Chet"
45,6,13,"and do not give Chet"
45,6,14,"For Chet"
45,6,15,"What then?  Should we commit averah, because we are not under the epoch of Torah but under the epoch of Chesed?  Chas v'shalom!"
45,6,16,"Do you not know that when you give control of yourselves as someone's avadim"
45,6,17,"But Baruch Hashem"
45,6,18,"Having been set free from Chet"
45,6,19,"--I speak in human terms on acount of the weakness of your frail fallen humanity.  For just as you handed over your natural capacities as avadim"
45,6,20,"For when you were avadim"
45,6,21,"What p'ri for Hashem did you produce then?  Things for which you are now have bushah"
45,6,22,"But now, having been set free from Chet"
45,6,23,"For the wages that"
45,7,1,"Do you not know, Achim b'Moshiach, for I speak to those who know the Torah, that the Torah exercises marut"
45,7,2,"For the agunah is bound by the Torah to her husband while he lives; but if her husband dies she is released from the Torah of her husband."
45,7,3,"Accordingly she will be named no'eh-fet"
45,7,4,"So then, Achim b'Moshiach, you also were put to death in relation to the Torah through the basar of Moshiach"
45,7,5,"For when we were in the basar"
45,7,6,"But now we have been released from the dominating ownership of the Torah, having died to that by which we were confined, so that we might serve in hitkhadeshut haRuach [haKodesh]"
45,7,7,"What then shall we say? That the Torah is considered as chet"
45,7,8,"But Chet"
45,7,9,"And in the absence of the Torah I was once alive. But when the mitzvoh"
45,7,10,"and I died. The mitzvoh"
45,7,11,"For Chet"
45,7,12,"So that the Torah is kedosha"
45,7,13,"Did that which is good, then, become mavet"
45,7,14,"For we know that the Torah is Ruchanit"
45,7,15,"For I do not know what I do/what I bring about.  For that which I commit is not what I want; but what I hate, that I do."
45,7,16,"But if that which I do is what I do not want, I agree with the Torah that the Torah is good."
45,7,17,"But now it is no longer I doing this/bringing this about, but [the power of] Chet"
45,7,18,"For I know that there dwells in me, that is, in my basar"
45,7,19,"For I fail to do good as I wish, but haRah"
45,7,20,"But if what I do not wish is that which I do, it is no longer I doing it but [the power of] Chet"
45,7,21,"I find then the chok"
45,7,22,"For I rejoice, I have simcha Torah, I have joy in the Torah of Hashem"
45,7,23,"but I see another Chok"
45,7,24,"Wretched man am I!  Who will deliver me from the body of this mavet"
45,7,25,"Hodu l'Hashem baMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu"
45,8,1,"Therefore, now there is no gezar din"
45,8,2,"For the Torah of the Ruach haKodesh that gives Chayyim in Moshiach Yehoshua [Jer.31:31-34; Ezek.36:26-27] has set you free from the Chok of Chet and Mavet."
45,8,3,"For what the Torah was unable to do in that it was weak through the basar"
45,8,4,"in order that the maleh chukat haTorah"
45,8,5,"For those who exist in terms of the basar take the side of the basar, whereas those who exist in terms of Ruach [Hakodesh] take the side of the Ruach Hakodesh."
45,8,6,"For the way of thinking of the basar is mavet"
45,8,7,"Because the way of thinking of the basar is hostility, eyvah"
45,8,8,"And those who are in the basar are not able to please G-d."
45,8,9,"However, you are not in the basar but in the Ruach Hakodesh, assuming that the Ruach Hashem does indeed dwell in you--if anyone does not have the Ruach HaMoshiach, that person does not belong to Moshiach."
45,8,10,"And if Moshiach is in you, the body"
45,8,11,"But if the Ruach of Him who raised Yehoshua from the Mesim dwells in you, He who raised Moshiach from the Mesim will give Chayyim to your mortal bodies as well, through His indwelling Ruach in you."
45,8,12,"So then, Achim b'Moshiach, we are under no obligation to the basar to live in accordance with the basar."
45,8,13,"For if you live in accordance with the basar you will certainly die; but if by the Ruach Hakodesh you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live."
45,8,14,"For as many as are led by the Ruach HaElohim, they are bnei HaElohim."
45,8,15,"For you did not receive a spirit of avdut, falling back into yir'ah"
45,8,16,"The Ruach Hakodesh Himself bears edut with our ruach that we are bnei HaElohim."
45,8,17,"And if bnei HaElohim, then also yoreshim"
45,8,18,"For I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not to be compared with the coming kavod"
45,8,19,"For the eager expectation of HaBri'ah"
45,8,20,"For HaBri'ah"
45,8,21,"because HaBri'ah"
45,8,22,"For we know that the whole Bri'ah"
45,8,23,"And not only so, but also we ourselves who have the bikkurim"
45,8,24,"For it is in terms of tikvah"
45,8,25,"But if we have tikvah for what we do not see, we eagerly await it with zitzfleisch."
45,8,26,"In the same way, the Ruach Hakodesh helps us in our weakness"
45,8,27,"And He who searches the levavot knows what is the way of thinking of the Ruach Hakodesh, because He intercedes as G-d would have it on behalf of the kedoshim.  HASHGACHAH"
45,8,28,"And we know that for those who love Hashem everything co-operates toward HaTov for those who are HaKeru'im"
45,8,29,"For those He had da'as of beterem"
45,8,30,"And those He decided upon from the beginning, He also summoned/called; and those He summoned/called, He also acquitted and pronounced to be YITZDAK IM HASHEM; and those He acquitted and pronounced to be YITZDAK IM HASHEM, He also set in eternal kavod"
45,8,31,"In view of these things, what therefore shall we say?  If Hashem is for us, who is against us?"
45,8,32,"He who indeed did not spare His own Ben HaElohim but gave Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him give us all things"
45,8,33,"Who will bring charges against the Bechirei HaElohim"
45,8,34,"Who is there to make mishpat to haresha'a"
45,8,35,"Who will separate us from the Ahavas Moshiach"
45,8,36,"As it is written, KI ALECHA HORAGNU KOL HAYOM NECHESHAVNU K'TZON TIVCHAH (For Your sake we are being killed all the day; we are reckoned as sheep for slaughter--TEHILLIM 44:22"
45,8,37,"But in all these things we prevail bichlal"
45,8,38,"For I am convinced that neither Mavet nor Chayyim nor malachim nor rulers, neither things present nor things to come nor kochot"
45,8,39,"neither height nor depth, nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the ahavas Hashem which is in Yehoshua Moshiach Adoneinu."
45,9,1,"I speak haEmes in Moshiach, I do not speak sheker, my matzpun tahor"
45,9,2,"that there is great agmat nefesh"
45,9,3,"For I could wish that my neshamah be put under cherem"
45,9,4,"in as much as they are Bnei Yisroel: theirs is the Mishpat HaBanim Adoption, the ma'amad HaBanim"
45,9,5,"theirs are HaAvot"
45,9,6,"But it is not as though the Dvar Hashem has failed.  For not all those descended from Yisroel are truly redeemed Yisroel"
45,9,7,"Nor is it as though all the banim of K'lal Yisroel are the ZERA of Avraham Avinu, but"
45,9,8,"That is, it is not the b'nei habasar"
45,9,9,"For this word is one of havtachah"
45,9,10,"Not only so, but also in the case of Rivkah"
45,9,11,"For when they were not yet born nor had done anything tov or rah, good or evil,in order that the tochnit Hashem"
45,9,12,"not from ma'asei mitzvot haTorah but from the One who makes the keri'ah"
45,9,13,"as it is written, VA'OHAV ES YA'AKOV V'ES ESAV SANEITI"
45,9,14,"What then shall we say? There is no avla"
45,9,15,"For to Moshe Rabbeinu He says, V'CHANOTI ES ASHER ACHON V'RICHAMETTI ES ASHER ARACHEM"
45,9,16,"So then, it is not a matter of the one who wills or the one who runs.  It is a matter of YAD HASHEM HACHANINAH"
45,9,17,"For the Kitvei Hakodesh says to Pharaoh, BA'AVUR ZOT HE'EMADTICHA BA'AVUR HAROTECHA ES KOCHI ULEMA'AN SAPER SHMI BECHOL HA'ARETZ"
45,9,18,"So then, to whom He wills He shows chaninah"
45,9,19,"You will say to me then: Why does He still find fault?  For who has resisted His will?"
45,9,20,"On the contrary, who are you, man, who answers back to G-d? VEYETZER AMAR LEYOTZRO"
45,9,21,"Or does the potter not have the right over the clay [YIRMEYAH 18:6] to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?"
45,9,22,"But what if naniach Hashem, willing to demonstrate His Charon Af Hashem"
45,9,23,"and in order that He might make known the wealth of His kavod"
45,9,24,"By which I mean us, whom also He called, not only from the Yehudim but also from the non-Jews,"
45,9,25,"as it says in Hoshea, V'AMARTI L'LO AMMI AMI ATAH"
45,9,26,"and it shall be in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there they shall be called B'NEI EL CHAI"
45,9,27,"Yeshayah proclaims concerning Yisroel, Even if the number of the Bnei Yisroel are as the sand of the sea, only the She'ar"
45,9,28,"for Hashem will complete and cut short and will perform His Word on the earth--Yeshayah 10:22-23."
45,9,29,"And as Yeshayah said beforehand, Except Adonoi Tzvaot had left us SARID KIM'AT (some survivors"
45,9,30,"What then shall we say? That Goyim who do not pursue Tzedek"
45,9,31,"whereas Yisroel pursuing a Tzedek"
45,9,32,"Why so?  Because it was not on the mekor"
45,9,33,"as it is written--Hinei, I place in Tziyon a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense; and he who believes in Me shall not be put to shame"
45,10,1,"Achim b'Moshiach, the great tshuka"
45,10,2,"For I can be meid"
45,10,3,"For, having no saving da'as of the Tzidkat Hashem"
45,10,4,"For Moshiach is the finishing line of"
45,10,5,"For Moshe Rabbeinu writes with reference to the"
45,10,6,"Whereas the Tzidkat Emunah"

45,10,8,"But what does it say?  The Dvar is near you, in your mouth and in your lev [DEVARIM 9:4; 30:12-14], that is, the Dvar of Emunah which we proclaim.    THE ANI MA'AMIN HODA'AH OF ORTHODOX JEWISH FAITH; NEED FOR GEULAH PERATIT"
45,10,9,"Because if you make hoda'ah"
45,10,10,"For with the heart one has emunah unto being YITZDAK IM HASHEM and with the mouth hoda'ah is made unto Yeshu'at Eloheinu."
45,10,11,"For the Kitvei Hakodesh says, Everyone who has emunah in Him shall not be put to shame--YESHAYAH 28:16."
45,10,12,""
45,10,13,"For V'HAYAH KOL ASHER YIKRA B'SHEM HASHEM"
45,10,14,"How therefore shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?  and how shall they believe in Him whom they have not heard?  And how shall they hear without someone preaching?"
45,10,15,"And how shall they do the work of maggidim? unless they have been sent as shluchim?  As it is written, How timely are the feet of those who preach Besuras HaGeulah--YESHAYAH 52:7."
45,10,16,"But not all have mishma'at"
45,10,17,"So then emunah comes from hearing, and hearing comes through the Dvar haMoshiach"
45,10,18,"But I say, is it the case that they have not heard?  On the contrary:  Their sound has gone out into all the earth and their words to the ends of the inhabited world--TEHILLIM 19:4. RAV SHA'UL IS USING TEHILLIM 19'S LANGUAGE ABOUT A REVELATION OF G-D THROUGH THE CREATED STARS TO EXPRESS THE POINT THAT THE REVELATION OF MOSHIACH YEHOSHUA HAS REACHED AROUND THE WORLD LIKE THE CREATED REVELATION OF THE GOOD NEWS HAS REACHED UNIVERSAL JEWRY THROUGH PREACHERS LIKE SHA'UL PREACHING IN THE DIASPORA SYNAGOGUES, SO THE JEWISH PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT EXCUSE. THE JEWISH PEOPLE CANNOT SAY THEY HAVE NOT HEARD ABOUT MOSHIACH YEHOSHUA.  NEXT RAV SHA'UL WILL SHOW THAT JEWISH PEOPLE WHO HEAR THE TORAH READ OUT FROM COVER TO COVER IN THE SHULS EVERY YEAR CANNOT SAY THEY HAVE NOT HEARD MOSHE RABBEINU SPEAK ABOUT THE ESCHATOLOGICAL INCOMING OF THE GENTILES, AN EVENT BEING FULFILLED IN RAV SHA'UL'S MINISTRY AND ATTESTED BY BOTH THE TORAH AND THE NEVIIM, WHICH SHA'UL NOW QUOTES. AM YISROEL OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN THE GOYIM OF THE WHOLE WORLD FLOCKING INTO EMUNAH IN THE MOSHIACH AS A FULFILMENT OF DEVARIM 32:21.  THE EMUNAH OF THE GOYIM AND THE LACK OF IT ON THE PART OF YISROEL ARE PLACARDED IN LARGE PRINT FOR ALL TO SEE IN THE WORDS OF THE KITVEI HAKODESH WHICH RAV SHA'UL NOW QUOTES, SO YISROEL IS WITHOUT EXCUSE"
45,10,19,"But I say, is it the case that Yisroel has not known? First, Moshe Rabbeinu says: I will provoke you to jealousy by a not nation; By a senseless nation I will make you angry.--DEVARIM 32:21."
45,10,20,"And Yeshayeh is bold as to say: I have been found by those who do not seek me; I have revealed myself to those who do not ask for me--YESHAYAH 65:1."
45,10,21,"But concerning Yisroel he"
45,11,1,"I ask, therefore, has Hashem repudiated His people? Not at all! Chas v'Shalom!  For I too am a ben Yisroel, of the zera Avraham"
45,11,2,"Hashem has not repudiated His people whom he foreknew [TEHILLIM 94:14; ROMANS 8:29). Or do you not know what the Kitvei Hakodesh says in the section about Eliyahu, how he appeals to Hashem against Yisroel?"
45,11,3,"Adonoi, they have killed your Neviim, they have torn down your mitzbe'achot"
45,11,4,"But what is Hashem's answer to him?  I have kept for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Ba'al. [MELACHIM ALEF 19:18]"
45,11,5,"Thus, therefore, also in the present time, there has come into being a she'arit"
45,11,6,"But if on the mekor"
45,11,7,"What then?  What Yisroel sought for, that it did not obtain; but hannivcharim"
45,11,8,"as it is written, G-d gave to them a ruach tardemah"
45,11,9,"And Dovid said, Let their shulchan"
45,11,10,"Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever. --TEHILLIM 68:23-24 TARGUM HASHIVIM; [69:22-23]."
45,11,11,"I ask, therefore, have they stumbled so as to fall?  Chas v'Shalom!  But by their pesha"
45,11,12,"And if their pesha"
45,11,13,"I am speaking to you Goyim.  So then, inasmuch as I am Shaliach haGoyim, I magnify my avodas kodesh, in the tikvah"
45,11,14,"that I might provoke my kindred to jealousy and might save some of them."
45,11,15,"For if their rejection means ritztzuy"
45,11,16,"If the terumah"
45,11,17,"But if some of the a'na'fim have been broken off, and you a wild olive, have been grafted among them and have become sharer in the richness of the olive tree's root,"
45,11,18,"do not boast"
45,11,19,"You will say, then, Branches were broken off in order that I might be grafted in."
45,11,20,"Quite so: they were broken off on the ground of no emunah"
45,11,21,"For if G-d did not spare the natural branches,neither will he spare you."
45,11,22,"Consider then the nedivut, the chesed of Hashem and also the mishpat hanora"
45,11,23,"Whereas, they also, if they do not continue in a condition of no emunah, shall be grafted in; for Hashem is able to graft them in again."
45,11,24,"For if you [Goyim] were cut off from the wild olive tree and grafted unnaturally into the cultivated olive tree, how much more shall those who belong to it naturally be grafted into their own olive tree."
45,11,25,"For I do not want you to be unaware, Achim b'Moshiach, of this raz"
45,11,26,"and so klal Yisroel shall be delivered, as it is written: Out of Tziyon"
45,11,27,"and this will be my Berit"
45,11,28,"With regard to the Besuras HaGeulah they are oyevim"
45,11,29,"For the matnat Hashem and the keri'at Hashem are irrevocable."
45,11,30,"For just as you Goyim were once without mishma'at to Hashem, but now have received chaninah"
45,11,31,"so also they have now been without mishma'at for your chaninah"
45,11,32,"For G-d has confined all in disobedience in order that He might have chaninah"
45,11,33,"O the depth of the riches and the chochmah"
45,11,34,"For who has known the Ruach"
45,11,35,"Or who has given in advance to Him so that His presents come only as a debt repaid? [IYOV 41:11]"
45,11,36,"Because from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. Lo haKavod l'Olamim. Omein."
45,12,1,"I appeal to you, therefore, Achim b'Moshiach, through the rachamei Hashem"
45,12,2,"Stop allowing yourself to be conformed to the Olam Hazeh, but be transformed by your hitkhadeshut haDa'as"
45,12,3,"For I say, through the chesed"
45,12,4,"For just as in one body we have many members"
45,12,5,"so we all are one body in Moshiach, and are individually members one of another--"
45,12,6,"having matanot"
45,12,7,"If we offer particular acts of avodas kodesh, it should be used in serving. One who functions as a rabbinic moreh in teaching should be active in teaching."

45,12,13,"With a spirit of koinonia, keep the pushke full for the needs of the kedoshim.  Aspire to hachnosas orchim.    ANTI-SEMITIC REDIFAH OR PERSECUTION BECAUSE OF THE HATED NAME OF OUR MOSHIACH REQUIRES A RESPONSE BASED ON THE TORAH AND THE KETUVIM, REMEMBERING THAT AS FAR AS YOUR OYEVIM ARE CONCERNED, BURNING BUSHAH"

45,13,5,"Wherefore it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of the Charon Af of Hashem, but also on account of matzpun tahor"
45,13,6,"For that is why you also pay tribute"

45,13,12,"The haLailah"
45,13,13,"Let us conduct ourselves decently as in Yom"
45,13,14,"But put on the Moshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu and make no provision for the Basar, to satisfy its ta'avot."
45,14,1,"But welcome the one who is weak in emunah"
45,14,2,"For example, one person has emunah"
45,14,3,"Let the one who eats not hold in contempt or despise the one who does not eat, and let not the one who does not eat pass judgment on the one who eats, for Hashem treats him as an oreach ratzuy"
45,14,4,"Who are you to condemn the 'eved"
45,14,5,"One person judges one day to be more important than another; another person judges every day to be alike.  Let each be fully convinced in his own mind."
45,14,6,"The one who holds an opinion on the day does so to Hashem. And the one who eats does so to Hashem, for he does the benching of the Birkat Hamazon to Hashem.  And the one who does not eat does so to Hashem and give the hodayah"
45,14,7,"For no  one of us lives for himself and no one dies for himself."
45,14,8,"For if we live, we live for Hashem; and if we die, we die for Hashem. So whether we live or whether we die, we belong to Hashem."
45,14,9,"For it was for this tachlis that Moshiach died and lived again, in order that he might have charge as Moshiach Adoneinu over both the mesim"
45,14,10,"So you, why do you judge your ach b'Moshiach?  Or you, why do you despise your ach b'Moshiach?  For we shall all stand in the Bet Din"
45,14,11,"for it is written, As I live, says Hashem, before Me KOL BERECH"
45,14,12,"So then each of us will give account of himself to Hashem."
45,14,13,"Let us therefore no longer pass judgment on one another, but decide this rather: not to put an occasion for michshol"
45,14,14,"I know and am convinced in Adoneinu Yehoshua that nothing is tamei"
45,14,15,"For if your brother is deeply upset on account of okhel"
45,14,16,"Therefore, do not let haTov of you be brought into contempt."
45,14,17,"For the Malchut Hashem is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of tsedek"
45,14,18,"For he who serves Moshiach in this is pleasing to Hashem and approved by people in general."
45,14,19,"So then we pursue what makes for shalom and for the building up of one another."
45,14,20,"Do not for the sake of okhel bring churban to the work of Hashem.                                                            NOW RAV SHA'UL ADDRESSES THE GOYIM ABOUT MATTERS OF MATZPUN"

45,15,7,"Therefore, treat each other as orchim ratzuy, as Moshiach welcomed you, to the kavod of Hashem"
45,15,8,"For I declare that Moshiach has become Mesharet Bnei haMilah"

45,15,16,"so that I might be a mesharet"
45,15,17,"Therefore I have this glorying in Moshiach Yehoshua in reference to what concerns G-d."
45,15,18,"For I will not presume to say anything, except of what Moshiach has accomplished through me for the mishma'at"
45,15,19,"by the ko'ach"
45,15,20,"thus making it my sheifos"

46,2,6,"But we do speak chochmah"
46,2,7,"But we speak the chochmah of Hashem in a hidden sod"
46,2,8,"a chochmah which not one of the rulers of Olam Hazeh has known, for, if they had had da'as, they would not have pierced and put to death on the Aitz haKelalat Hashem"
46,2,9,"But even as it has been written, UMEOLAM LO SHAMU LO HE'EZINU AYIN LO RA'ATAH"
46,2,10,"But Hashem has made the hitgalut haSod"
46,2,11,"For who of Bnei Adam has da'as of the things of Bnei Adam except the ruach"
46,2,12,"Now we have not received the ruach"
46,2,13,"which things also we speak, not in dvarim"
46,2,14,"But a person without hitkhadeshut"
46,2,15,"Now the man of the Ruach Hakodesh discerns all things, but, by no one is he discerned."
46,2,16,"For, Who has known the mind of Hashem so as to instruct Him [YESHAYAH 40:14 TARGUM HASHIVIM]?  But we have the mind of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. [Yeshayah 40:13]"
46,3,1,"Achim b'Moshiach, I was not able to speak to you as to men of hitkhadeshut and ruchaniyut; I had to speak to you as anshei haBasar, as olalim b'Moshiach."
46,3,2,"Chalav"
46,3,3,"For still you are anshei haBasar"
46,3,4,"For, whenever anyone says, I am of Sha'ul, but another, I am of Apollos, are you not as anshei shechichim"
46,3,5,"What then is Apollos?  And what is Sha'ul? Klei kodesh ministers of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, through whom you came to emunah, even as to each one a task was given by Adoneinu."
46,3,6,"I planted, Apollos watered, but Hashem gave the increase."
46,3,7,"Therefore, neither is the one planting anything nor the one watering, but it is the One giving the increase--Hashem!"
46,3,8,"Now the one planting and the one watering are be'ichud"
46,3,9,"For we are fellow po'alim"
46,3,10,"According to the Chen v'Chesed Hashem having been given to me as a bannai chacham"
46,3,11,"For no other yesod other than the one that has been laid can be laid: Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. [Yeshayah 28:16]"
46,3,12,"Now if anyone builds on the yesod with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble--"
46,3,13,"the ma'aseh"
46,3,14,"If anyone's ma'asei he built on the yesod will survive"
46,3,15,"if anyone's ma'aseh will be consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved"
46,3,16,"Do you not have da'as that you are a Heikhal Hashem and the Ruach Hakodesh of Hashem dwells in you?"
46,3,17,"If anyone attempts to cause churban to the Heikhal Hashem,  G-d will destroy this man, for the Heikhal Hashem is kadosh. and you are that Heikhal."
46,3,18,"Let no one deceive himself; if anyone presumes to be chacham among you in Olam Hazeh, let him become a yold"
46,3,19,"For, the chochmah"
46,3,20,"And again, HASHEM YODE'A MACHSH'VOT ADAM KI HEMAH HEVEL"
46,3,21,"So let no one boast in Bnei Adam: for all things belong to you,"
46,3,22,"whether Sha'ul or Apollos or Kefa, or haOlam"
46,3,23,"and you are Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's and Moshiach is G-d's."
46,4,1,"So let a man consider us as Gabba'im of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach and mefakkechim"
46,4,2,"Moreover, it is sought in mefakkechim that one be found that has ne'emanut"
46,4,3,"But to me it is a very small thing that I be brought before your Bet Din, as it were, for mishpat"
46,4,4,"I am aware of nothing against myself, but not in this have I been yitzdak"
46,4,5,"Therefore, do not judge anything before the time, until the Bias Adoneinu [Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach], who both will bring to Ohr"
46,4,6,"Now these things, Achim b'Moshiach, I made a dimyon"
46,4,7,"For who makes you so distinguished? And, by the way, what do you have which you did not receive? And if indeed you were given it, why this ga'avah boastfulness as if you had not received it? ALREADY YOU ARE MECHUBADIK!  SECHI UMAOS TESIMEINU BEKEREV HA'AMMIM"
46,4,8,"Already you have so much, already you ascended to osher"
46,4,9,"For I omein believe that Hashem has exhibited us, the Shluchim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, as last in the program, condemned to death, because, like wretches under a mishpat mavet"
46,4,10,"We are kesilim"
46,4,11,"Until the present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are beaten and homeless."
46,4,12,"And we have parnasah, toiling with our own hands, we labor working with the our own hands; being reviled, we make a beracha to the revilers; being persecuted, we endure it;"
46,4,13,"being defamed by loshon hora, we conciliate.  We have become what the earth wants swept out the door, something considered trash the Olam Hazeh wants removed. [Yirmeyah 20:18; Ekhah 3:45]    IT IS NOT THE TACHLIS OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S SHLIACH TO BRING THE CORINTHIAN GOYIM UNDER BUSHAH BUT TO EXHORT THEM IN THE RUACH HAKODESH TO BE AS YELADIM IMITATING THEIR ABBA"
46,4,14,"The purpose of this iggeret is not to bring you under bushah"
46,4,15,"For, though you may have in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach morei derech numbering ten thousand, you have not many Avot: for in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach through the Besuras HaGeulah I became your abba."
46,4,16,"Therefore, I encourage you, imitate me."
46,4,17,"Because of this very thing, I sent Timotiyos to you-- Timotiyos, who is my beni haahuv"
46,4,18,"Now as to my coming to you, some were puffed up, [Yirmeyah 43:2]"
46,4,19,"but I will come shortly to you, im yirtzeh Hashem"
46,4,20,"For the Malchut Hashem depends not on the talk [of the ish safatayim"
46,4,21,"What do you want?  That I should come to you, so to speak, with an abba's switch or in ahavah and a anavat ruach"
46,5,1,"Zenut"
46,5,2,"And you have been puffed up with ga'avah"
46,5,3,"For I indeed being not present in habasar but being not absent in the Ruach Hakodesh have already, as being present, pronounced the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's Bet Din mishpat on the one who has done such a thing."
46,5,4,"In the name of Adoneinu Yehoshua, when you have assembled in your shul"
46,5,5,"you are to transmit and hand over to Hasatan such a person for the churban of the basar"
46,5,6,"Your boasting is not good.  Do you not have da'as that a little chometz all the mixture leavens?       MOSHIACH OUR KORBAN PESACH"
46,5,7,"Purge out the old chometz"
46,5,8,"So let us celebrate Pesach, not with old se'or, nor with the se'or of kavvanah ra'ah"
46,5,9,"I wrote to you in the iggeret not to mix with those engaging in acts of zenut"
46,5,10,"not meaning complete dissociation from the zanayim of Olam Hazeh or those guilty of chamdanut"
46,5,11,"But, now I wrote to you not to mix with any Ach b'Moshiach who is a zanay"
46,5,12,"For what is it to me to sit as a dayan in the Bet Din and then judge ones outside the kehillah? Will your Bet Din not judge the ones within?"
46,5,13,"But the outsiders Hashem judges. UVI'ARTA HARA MIKIRBECHA You must purge the evil from among you"
46,6,1,"Does anyone of you having a dispute with an Ach b'Moshiach dare to be judged before the resha'im"
46,6,2,"Or do you not have da'as that the kedoshim will sit in mishpat over the Olam Hazeh?  And if the Olam Hazeh is to be judged by you, are you incompetent dayanim to try the smallest cases?"
46,6,3,"Do you lack da'as that the malachim will come before our Bet Din?  Not to mention the things of Olam Hazeh!"
46,6,4,"If you have, then, cases concerning matters of Olam Hazeh, how could you appoint as your Bet Din dayanim men who have no standing in the kehillah?"
46,6,5,"I speak to your bushah"
46,6,6,"But an Ach b'Moshiach takes another Ach b'Moshiach to court, and this before the courtroom of Apikorosim"
46,6,7,"Already, therefore, it is a total defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another.  Why not rather suffer wrong?  Why not rather be cheated?"
46,6,8,"But you yourselves do wrong and practice hona'ah"
46,6,9,"Or do you not have da'as that the resha'im"
46,6,10,"nor ganavim"
46,6,11,"And some of you were these things.  But you were made tahor"
46,6,12,"All things to me are proper"
46,6,13,"Maakhal"
46,6,14,"And Hashem brought about the Techiyas haMesim for Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu and will also bring about the Techiyas haMesim for us through his gevurah"
46,6,15,"Do you not have da'as that your gufot"
46,6,16,"Or do you have no da'as that of the one joining himself to a zonah V'HAYU L'VASAR ECHAD"
46,6,17,"But the one with devekut"
46,6,18,"Flee zenut"
46,6,19,"Or have you no da'as that your guf"
46,6,20,"For [the Geulah redemption of] you [from the Golus of Chet] was purchased with a price; therefore, bring kavod to Hashem with your gufot. [Tehillim 74:2]"
46,7,1,"Now, concerning the things in your iggeret, let's take up the next inyan"
46,7,2,"But, because of the acts of zenut, let each Ben Adam have his own isha, and let each isha have her own ba'al"
46,7,3,"Let the ba'al render the conjugal chov"
46,7,4,"It is not the isha who has samchut"
46,7,5,"Do not deprive each other, unless by agreement for a set time, that you may renew zerizut"
46,7,6,"But I say this according to concession"
46,7,7,"But, I wish kol Bnei Adam even to be as I am; however, [this is impossible since] each has his own matanah"
46,7,8,"But, I say to the bochrim [including anyone who is an eltere bochur"
46,7,9,"but if they do not have shlitah atzmi, let them marry. For better it is to marry than with Aish to be set ablaze."
46,7,10,"But to the ones having entered bibrit hanisuim"
46,7,11,"But, if indeed she is separated, let her remain so, or be reconciled to her basherter; and a ba'al"
46,7,12,"But, to the rest I--Sha'ul--say, not Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu: if any Ach b'Moshiach has an isha who is an Apikoros and she is willing to live with him, let him not leave her;"
46,7,13,"and if an isha has a ba'al"
46,7,14,"For, [following the principle of bikkurim], the ba'al who is an Apikoros is mekudeshet b'Ruach Hakodesh"
46,7,15,"But, if the one who is an Apikoros separates and departs, let the separation occur; the Ach b'Moshiach has not been enslaved, or the Achot b'Moshiach in such cases; but Hashem has called you in shalom."
46,7,16,"For how do you know, isha, if you will not bring your basherter"
46,7,17,"Only each of you walk the derech [according to Hashem's tochnit--Rom.8:28) to which you were called by Hashem"
46,7,18,"If as a ben Berit with bris milah anyone received their calling, let him conceal it; if anyone as a ben Noach without bris milah has been called, let him not undergo bris milah;"
46,7,19,"bris milah is not everything nor the lack of it, but being shomer mitzvot Hashem."
46,7,20,"Each one walk on the derech of his keri'ah"
46,7,21,"If while a bond-servant you were called, do not let it consume you, although if you can gain your deror"
46,7,22,"For, the one in Hashem having been called while a bond-servant is [Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach] Adoneinu's ben Chorim"
46,7,23,"You were bought with a pidyon nefesh price; do not become avadim haBnei Adam."
46,7,24,"Each one wherever on the derech of Chayyim he was called, Achim b'Moshiach, there let him remain in devekut with Hashem. CONCERNING THE BETULOT IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE WHOLE SCHEME OF THINGS IN THE OLAM HAZEH IS IN THE CRISIS OF HAKETZ AND IS PASSING AWAY"
46,7,25,"Next sugya"
46,7,26,"I consider therefore, it to be beneficial, because of the impending crisis"
46,7,27,"Have you entered bibrit hanisuim"
46,7,28,"But if indeed you enter bibrit hanisuim"
46,7,29,"Now this I say, Achim b'Moshiach, the time [until haKetz] has been shortened. From now on, let those having nashim live as if not having nashim,"
46,7,30,"and let the ones weeping as not weeping, and let the ones having simcha as not having simcha, and let the ones buying as not possessing,"
46,7,31,"and let the ones using the Olam Hazeh as not fully using it: for, the present form of Olam Hazeh is passing away."
46,7,32,"But I would have you free from atzvat lev"
46,7,33,"But the one having taken an isha cares for the things of the Olam Hazeh, how he may please his isha,"
46,7,34,"and he has been divided"
46,7,35,"Now, this I say for your own benefit, not that I may throw a noose on your deror"
46,7,36,"However, if anyone thinks he does not have proper hitnahagut"
46,7,37,"But he who in his lev has settled the decision, not having the need [of conjugal intimacy], but having mastery concerning his own desire,  and this he in his lev has decided, not to enter bibrit hanisuim with his betulah"
46,7,38,"So then both the one entering bibrit hanisuim with his betulah does well, and the one not entering bebrit hanisuim with his arusah"
46,7,39,"An isha has been bound"
46,7,40,"However, ashrey is she, and even more so, if she remains as she is; and I think in this da'at"
46,8,1,"Now concerning the sacrifice to an elil"
46,8,2,"If anyone presumes he has da'as of anything, he does not yet have da'as the necessary da'as."
46,8,3,"But if a person has Ahavas Hashem, Hashem has da'as of that person. [Yirmeyah 1:5]"
46,8,4,"Now concerning the eating of the okhel at the mitzbeach of avodah zarah sacrificed to an elil"
46,8,5,"For even if there are so-called g-ds [believed wrongly to be] either in Shomayim or on ha'Aretz, even as there are [in popular tradition] so-called g-ds many and  l-rds many,"
46,8,6,"yet we have da'as that there is ADONOI ECHAD"
46,8,7,"However, not kol Bnei Adam have this da'as"
46,8,8,"But ma'achal"
46,8,9,"But beware lest somehow your cherut"
46,8,10,"For if anyone sees you, the one having da'as"
46,8,11,"For the one being weak [in emunah] is being destroyed by your da'as, the Ach b'Moshiach for the sake of whom Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach died."
46,8,12,"And thus by sinning against the Achim b'Moshiach and wounding their weak matzpunim"
46,8,13,"Therefore, if ma'achal causes my Ach b'Moshiach to trip on a michshol, I should never eat meat again, lest I cause my Ach b'Moshiach to stumble."
46,9,1,"Do I not have cherut [in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach]?  Am I not a shliach? Have I not seen Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu? Are you not my po'al"
46,9,2,"If to others I am not a shliach, surely I am to you, for you are the chatam"
46,9,3,"My apologetic to the ones cross-examining me is this:"
46,9,4,"Do I not have the privilege of eating and drinking?"
46,9,5,"Is the privilege not mine to take an achot b'Moshiach as isha in my travels for Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's avodas kodesh, just as the rest of his Shluchim do and the Achim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu and Kefa?"
46,9,6,"Or is it only Bar-Nabba and I who are denied the privilege of not working at a parnasah?"
46,9,7,"Whoever heard of someone serving as a chaiyal"
46,9,8,"Do I say this according to the dvar haBnei Adam?  Or does not the Torah say these things?"
46,9,9,"For, in the Torah of Moshe Rabbenu it has been written, LO TACHSOM SHOR BEDISHO"
46,9,10,"Or does he not speak altogether for our sake, and for us that Hashem says this?  Yes, for us, because it was written that the one plowing ought to plow on in tikvah, and the one threshing ought to partake with tikvah. [Mishle 11:25]"
46,9,11,"If we sowed spiritual things to you, is it too much if we reap in material things from you?  [Rom.15:27]"
46,9,12,"If others over you can claim this privilege, can we not even more?  But we did not make use of this privilege; we endure all things, lest any hindrance we should give to the Besuras HaGeulah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
46,9,13,"Do you not have da'as that the kohanim serving in the Beis Hamikdash sherut"
46,9,14,"So also Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu appointed the ones proclaiming the Besuras HaGeulah to get their parnasah from the Besuras HaGeulah. RAV SHA'UL IS MOICHEL"
46,9,15,"But I  have not used any of these privileges; I did not write these things that it might be so with me; for it is better for me rather to die than that someone deprive me of my kavod [in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach--Phil.1:21)."
46,9,16,"For if I preach the Besuras HaGeulah there is nothing for me to boast about, als"
46,9,17,"For, if I do this willingly, I have a sachar"
46,9,18,"What then is, my sachar"
46,9,19,"For being no indentured servant to any one of the Bnei Adam, I made myself a servant [working for nothing] to kol Bnei Adam,  that I might gain the more."
46,9,20,"And I became to the Yehudim as a Yehudi, that I might gain Yehudim; to the ones under Torah, I became as under Torah"
46,9,21,"to the ones without Torah, as without Torah (not being under [the epoch of] Hashem's Torah but being under [the epoch of] Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's Torah [Yeshayah 42:4], that I may gain the ones without Torah."
46,9,22,"I became weak to the weak ones that I might gain the weak ones; I have become all things to all men, that by all means I might save some."
46,9,23,"And all things I do because of the Besuras HaGeulah, that a fellow partaker and devekut sharer in it I may become."
46,9,24,"Do you not have da'as that the ones running on a race course all indeed run, but, one receives the prize?  So run that you may obtain the prize.   RAV SHA'UL EXPLAINS HIS HAKPADA STRINGENCY"
46,9,25,"And everyone competing in the [Olympic] games in all things exercises shlitah atzmi, those ones, therefore, that they may obtain a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable."
46,9,26,"Therefore, I run not as one without a fixed goal, I box as not beating the air,"
46,9,27,"But I am not sparing with my guf"
46,10,1,"I do not want you to be without da'as, Achim b'Moshiach, that Avoteinu all were under the anan"
46,10,2,"and all into Moshe Rabbenu were given tevilah in the anan"
46,10,3,"and all of the same spiritual ma'achal"
46,10,4,"and all of the same spiritual drink drank, for they were drinking from a spiritual TZUR following them [Shemot 17:6; Bamidbar 20:11;; Tehillim 78:15; 105:41], and that TZUR was Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
46,10,5,"But Hashem was not pleased with most of them, for they were strewn about in the desert, VAYISHCHATEM BAMIDBAR"
46,10,6,"Now these things occurred as moftim"
46,10,7,"Neither should you become ovdei elilim"
46,10,8,"Neither should we commit zenut as some of them committed zenut and fell in one day twenty-three thousand [Bamidbar 25:1,9]."
46,10,9,"Neither let us tempt Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, as some of them put Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to the test, and by nechashim"
46,10,10,"Neither should we murmur and grumble even as some of them VAYILONU"
46,10,11,"Now, these things happened to those ones as moftim"
46,10,12,"So then the one that nemon"
46,10,13,"No nissayon"
46,10,14,"Therefore, my chaverim, flee from avodah zarah."
46,10,15,"I speak as to thinking men; you judge what I say."
46,10,16,"The kos haBeracha"
46,10,17,"Because the matzoh is echad, we, many as we are, are one guf"
46,10,18,"Observe Yisroel according to the basar. Are not the ones eating the korbanot"
46,10,19,"What then am I saying?  That a sacrifice to an elil"
46,10,20,"No, the things which they sacrifice, YIZB'CHU LASHEDIM LO ELOHIM"
46,10,21,"You are not able to drink from the kos Hashem and also from the kos haShedim"
46,10,22,"Or is it that you would move Hashem to kinah"
46,10,23,"`All things are lawful'?  But not all things are beneficial; All things are lawful?  But not all things edify"
46,10,24,"Let no one seek his own benefit but the benefit of the other."
46,10,25,"Everything  being sold in a meat market eat without raising qualms of matzpun"
46,10,26,"For LAHASHEM HA'ARETZ UMELOAH (The earth is the L-rd's and the fullness thereof TEHILLIM 24:1; 50:12; 89:11; Shemot 9:29; 19:5; Iyov 41:11; Tehillim 50:12]."
46,10,27,"If anyone of the Apikorosim invites you and you want to go, eat everything being set before you without raising qualms of matzpun"
46,10,28,"But if anyone should say to you, this is offered in zevach"
46,10,29,"But I speak not about your matzpun but about the matzpun of the other man, for why is my cherut"
46,10,30,"If I partake with Birkat Hamazon"
46,10,31,"Whether, therefore, you eat or you drink or whatever you do, do all things to the kavod"
46,10,32,"Be without michshol both to Yehudim and to Yevanim and to the Kehillah of Hashem,"
46,10,33,"even as I also please Bnei Adam in all things, not seeking my own advantage but that of the many, that they may be brought to Yeshua'at Eloheinu."
46,11,1,"Become imitators of me as I also am an imitator of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. IN VIEW OF THE TURNING OF THE AGES, AND AS WE LIVE TOGETHER IN THE DAWN OF THE OLAM HABAH, THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ZACHAR NOR NEKEVAH"
46,11,2,"Now, I commend you that in all things you have remembered me and, you hold fast to the masoret torat haShlichim just as I transmitted and handed them over to you."
46,11,3,"But I want you to have da'as that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is the rosh"
46,11,4,"Every ben Adam davening or speaking forth a nevu'ah"
46,11,5,"But every isha davening or speaking forth a nevu'ah"
46,11,6,"For, if an isha is not covered, also let her be shorn.  But als"
46,11,7,"For a ben Adam indeed ought not to be covered on the rosh, being the demut HASHEM"
46,11,8,"For Adam is not out of the Isha but Isha out of Adam"
46,11,9,"Indeed, Adam was not created because of the Isha, but the Isha because of Adam"
46,11,10,"Because of this, the Isha ought to have a kesut rosh"
46,11,11,"However, neither is Isha without Adam"
46,11,12,"For just as the Isha comes out of Adam"
46,11,13,"You yourselves be the dayan [of the Bet Din]: is it fitting for an isha to offer tefillos to Hashem [in shul] begile rosh"
46,11,14,"Does not teva"
46,11,15,"But if an isha wears a long hair-do of a lady's coiffure, it is her kavod"
46,11,16,"But if anyone presumes in his thinking to be contentious, we have no such minhag, nor do the kehillot of Hashem [throughout the world].  THE SEUDAH OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ABUSED"
46,11,17,"But in giving the divrei Torah that follows I give no commendation"
46,11,18,"Ershtins"
46,11,19,"For, it is necessary also for kitot"
46,11,20,"Therefore, your farbrengen gatherings in one kahal"
46,11,21,"For each one rushes ahead with his own seudah"
46,11,22,"Hey, you people, do you not have houses in which to eat and to drink?  Or do you despise the Kehillah"
46,11,23,"For I received from Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu that which also I transmitted and handed on to you, that Adoneinu Yehoshua, on the very lailah"
46,11,24,"and, having made the ha-Motzi, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach offered the betzi'at halechem"
46,11,25,"In like manner, after eating the Pesach seudah, also [after the beracha over] the [Kiddush] Cup, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said, This [Kiddush] Kos"
46,11,26,"For as often as  you eat this Pesach matzah and drink from this Pesach Kiddush Cup, you do proclaim the mavet [Yeshayah 53:8-9; Daniel 9:26] of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu until the Bias HaMoshiach.  NEED FOR CHESHBON HANEFESH"
46,11,27,"Therefore, whoever eats the Pesach matzah or drinks the Kiddush cup of [Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach] Adoneinu unworthily will be guilty and answerable for the guf"
46,11,28,"But let a Ben Adam apply cheshbon hanefesh to himself and in that manner let him eat of the Pesach matzah and let him drink of the Pesach Kiddush cup."
46,11,29,"For the one eating and drinking is the one eating and drinking mishpat to himself when not discerning the guf"
46,11,30,"Because of this, many among you are weak and cholim"
46,11,31,"But if we were judging ourselves [in teshuvah], we would not be brought into mishpat (din"
46,11,32,"But, being brought into mishpat (din"
46,11,33,"Therefore, Achim b'Moshiach of mine, when you have your farbrengen gatherings and you gather for tish, wait for one another."
46,11,34,"If anyone is so hungerik"
46,12,1,"Now I do not want you to lack da'as concerning the things of the Ruach Hakodesh, Achim b'Moshiach."
46,12,2,"You have da'as that when you WERE Goyim [you are no longer heathen pagans], somehow you were influenced and led astray to the to ELILIM ILLEMIM"
46,12,3,"Therefore, I make known to you that no one speaking by the Ruach Hakodesh of Hashem says, Al Yehoshua ki Cherem hu"
46,12,4,"There are different kinds of matnot"
46,12,5,"There are different avodot kodesh"
46,12,6,"And there are a variety of activities [of the Ruach Hakodesh], but the same G-d working all in all."
46,12,7,"But to each is given the disclosure of the Ruach Hakodesh for benefit:"
46,12,8,"to one through the Ruach Hakodesh is given a dvar chochmah"
46,12,9,"to another, by the same Ruach Hakodesh, emunah"
46,12,10,"to another those of cholel niflaot"
46,12,11,"All these things are activated by the one and same Ruach Hakodesh, distributing individually to each one as he determines. HAGUF"
46,12,12,"For even as the guf"
46,12,13,"For also in one Ruach Hakodesh we were all given a tevilah  into one guf"
46,12,14,"For the guf"
46,12,15,"If the regel"
46,12,16,"And if the ozen"
46,12,17,"If the whole guf"
46,12,18,"But now Hashem set the evarim"
46,12,19,"And if all were all one evar"
46,12,20,"As now, though, many evarim"
46,12,21,"And the ayin"
46,12,22,"Just the opposite, the evarim of the guf"
46,12,23,"And those evarim of the guf"
46,12,24,"Whereas, our evarim with greater kibbud have no need of more.  However, Hashem has so composed the achdut of yichudim"
46,12,25,"lest there be schisms"
46,12,26,"And when one evar"
46,12,27,"Now you are Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's guf"
46,12,28,"Now Hashem placed some in the edah haMoshiach"
46,12,29,"Surely not all are shluchim?  Surely not all are nevi'im?  Surely not all are rabbinical morim? Surely not all are those cholel niflaot"
46,12,30,"Surely not all have matnot harippuy"
46,12,31,"But earnestly desire the greater matnot"
46,13,1,"If in the leshonot"
46,13,2,"And if I have nevu'ah"
46,13,3,"And if I'm a marbitz tzedaka and give all I possess in gemilut chasadim and if I give my guf"
46,13,4,"Ahavah"
46,13,5,"does not behave shamelessly, does not insist in anochiyut"
46,13,6,"Ahavah does not find simcha in avlah"
46,13,7,"Ahavah covers all things"
46,13,8,"Ahavah"
46,13,9,"For we have da'as in part, and we have divrei nevu'ah in part."
46,13,10,"But when hashlamah comes, the olam katan will disappear."
46,13,11,"When I was a yeled, I used to speak like one, think like one, reason like one. But when I have became mevugar"
46,13,12,"For still we see through a mirror indistinctly.  But then [in the Olam Haba], distinctly panim el panim"
46,13,13,"But now remains emunah"
46,14,1,"Pursue ahavah"
46,14,2,"For the one speaking in a lashon"
46,14,3,"However, the one speaking forth divrei nevu'ah"
46,14,4,"The one speaking in a lashon"
46,14,5,"Now I desire all of you to speak in leshonot"
46,14,6,"But now, Achim b'Moshiach, if I come to you speaking in leshonot"
46,14,7,"You have da'as about the inanimate flute or harp: they speak sounds but but if they do not articulate a distinction in the notes, how will it be known what is being played on the flute or on the harp?"
46,14,8,"Indeed, if a shofar gives an unclear trumpet-call, who will prepare himself for kerav"
46,14,9,"So also unless you by your  lashon"
46,14,10,"There are doubtless many kinds of foreign languages in the Olam Hazeh, and not one is meaningless."
46,14,11,"If, therefore, I do not have da'as the meaning of the language, I will be to the speaker a foreigner and the speaker will be a foreigner with me. [Bereshis 11:7]"
46,14,12,"So also you, als"
46,14,13,"Therefore, the speaker in a lashon"
46,14,14,"For if  I daven"
46,14,15,"Nu?"
46,14,16,"Otherwise, if you make a beracha [in leshonot] with your neshamah, how will the am haAretz, who have no idea what you are saying, answer the Omein? [Devarim 27:15:26; Divrey Hayamim Alef 16:36; Nechemyah 8:6; Tehillim 106:48]"
46,14,17,"For indeed you make the beracha well enough, but the other is not being edified."
46,14,18,"Modeh Ani Hashem that I speak in leshonot more than all of you,"
46,14,19,"but in a kehillah I want to speak five words with my  sikhliyut"
46,14,20,"Achim b'Moshiach, be not yeladim in your machshavot"
46,14,21,"In the Torah it stands written, KI BELA'AGEI SAFAH UVELASHON ACHERET YEDABER EL-HAAM HAZEH...V'LO AVU SH'MO'A"
46,14,22,"So then the leshonot"
46,14,23,"If, therefore, the kehillah has a farbrengen gathering and all speak in leshonot"
46,14,24,"However, if all speak forth divrei hanevu'ah"
46,14,25,"what is hiding in his lev"
46,14,26,"Nu? Well? Achim b'Moshiach, when you come together, each one a mizmor"
46,14,27,"If anyone speaks in a lashon"
46,14,28,"But if there is no one to give the petron, let the one with the lashon"
46,14,29,"And let shenayim or shloshah nevi'im speak and let the other nevi'im be used with discernings of ruchot"
46,14,30,"And if a dvar hitgalut"
46,14,31,"For you all are able one by one to to speak forth a dvar hanevu'ah"
46,14,32,"And the neshamot of nevi'im are subject to the nevi'im."
46,14,33,"For Hashem is no Elohei haMevucha"
46,14,34,"Let the nashim in the kehillot be silent, for it is not permitted for them to blurt out, but let them become nichna"
46,14,35,"And if the nashim wish to inquire about something, let them inquire of their own be'alim b'bayis"
46,14,36,"Or from you did the dvar Hashem go forth"
46,14,37,"If anyone thinks himself to be a navi or a man of the Ruach Hakodesh"
46,14,38,"But if anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized."
46,14,39,"So then, Achim b'Moshiach of mine, earnestly desire to speak forth a dvar hanevu'ah"
46,14,40,"Let let all things be done b'seder and without bushah"
46,15,1,"Now, Achim b'Moshiach, I draw your attention to the Besuras HaGeulah which I proclaimed to you, which also you received, in which also you stand firm, [Yeshayah 40:9]"
46,15,2,"through which also you are brought to Yeshua'at Eloheinu, provided you hold fast to the dvar Torah which I proclaimed to you, unless you received it in vain"
46,15,3,"For I transmitted and handed on to you as authoritative Torah, rishon"
46,15,4,"and that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was buried in a kever"
46,15,5,"and that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was seen by Kefa, then by the Sheneym Asar,"
46,15,6,"afterward Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was seen by over five hundred Achim b'Moshiach at one time, of whom most remain alive until now, though some sleep the sleep of the mesim."
46,15,7,"Afterward, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was seen by Ya'akov"
46,15,8,"And, last of all, even as if to one born not normally [like the rest], Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was seen by me also"
46,15,9,"For I am the least of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's Shluchim,  not qualified to be called a Shliach, because I brought redifah"
46,15,10,"But by the Chen v'Chesed Hashem I am what I am. And the Chen v'Chesed Hashem of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to me was not in vain, but more abundantly than all the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's Shluchim I labored, yet it was not I, but the Chen v'Chesed Hashem with me."
46,15,11,"Whether it was I or the other of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's Shluchim, so we preached as Moshiach's maggidim, and so you had emunah and became Moshiach's ma'aminim.  AGAINST THOSE WITH THE GREEK PHILOSOPHY THAT DENIES THE TECHIYAS HAMESIM: IF FOR THE OLAM HAZEH ONLY [AND NOT FOR THE OLAM HABA] WE HAVE TIKVATEINU IN REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH, WE ARE TO BE PITIED MORE THAT KOL BNEI ADAM;  THE TECHIYAS HAMESIM AND THE GLORIOUS GUF"
46,15,12,"And if Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is being preached that his Techiyah"
46,15,13,"And if there is no Techiyas haMesim, neither then has Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach be raised."
46,15,14,"And if Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach has not been raised, then our preaching to you was in vain and also in vain is your emunah"
46,15,15,"Moreover, we are found also to edei sheker"
46,15,16,"For if the Mesim"
46,15,17,"and if Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach has not already had his Techiyah from the Mesim, your emunah is futile, you are still in your averos"
46,15,18,"and even the ones who sleep the sleep of the Mesim in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach have perished."
46,15,19,"Listen, if for the Olam Hazeh only we have tikvateinu in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, we are to be pitied more that kol Bnei Adam.  A DESCRIPTION BEGINS OF THE TECHIYAS HAMESIM AND THE GLORIOUS GUF"
46,15,20,"But in fact Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach has had His Techiyah!  Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is the  Bikkurim"
46,15,21,"For als"
46,15,22,"For as in Adam all die"
46,15,23,"But each one in his own order; the Bikkurim, Moshiach; afterward the ones of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach at the Bias HaMoshiach;"
46,15,24,"then haKetz when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gives over the Malchut Hashem to G-d, even Elohim Avinu"
46,15,25,"For it is necessary for Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to reign until Hashem puts all his OYVIM"
46,15,26,"The last Oyev"
46,15,27,"For KOL HASHEM put TACHAT RAGLAV All things He subjected under His feet--TEHILLIM 8:7"
46,15,28,"But, when all things are subjected to Hashem, then also the Ben haElohim [Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach] himself will be subjected to the One"
46,15,29,"Otherwise, what will they do, the ones being given tevilah  on behalf of the dead? If the Mesim really are not raised, why indeed are their ones given tevilah on behalf of the Mesim? DO YOU GOYIM NOT UNDERSTAND THE CENTRALITY OF IMPORTANCE OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE TECHIYAS HAMESIM IN THE JUDAISM OF OUR LIVING REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH?  DO YOU GOYIM NOT UNDERSTAND THE CENTRALITY OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE TECHIYAS HAMESIM TO HIS JEWISH SHLUCHIM FACING DEATH'S DANGER EVERYDAY?"
46,15,30,"Why also are we putting ourselves at risk and in danger every hour?"
46,15,31,"Daily I die--and that is as true a fact, Achim b'Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach--as it is that I kavod over you in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu."
46,15,32,"If it were a mere humanistic matter, my fighting, so to speak, with wild beasts in Ephesus"
46,15,33,"Do not fall under a delusion: Bad chavrusashaft"
46,15,34,"Wake up and come to your senses.  Start walking in the derech tzaddikim"
46,15,35,"But someone will question, How this Techiyas haMesim? And in the Techiyas haMesim, with what kind of guf"
46,15,36,"Foolish man, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies."
46,15,37,"And what is it you sow?  Not the guf"
46,15,38,"However, Hashem chooses [another] guf"
46,15,39,"Now basar is not all the same:  Bnei Adam have one kind of basar, animals, another; birds, another; fish, another;"
46,15,40,"and there are gufot baShomayim"
46,15,41,"There is one kavod"
46,15,42,"So also is the Techiyas haMesim.  That which is sown is of one kind, perishable; that which is raised is of another kind, imperishable. [Daniel 12:3]"
46,15,43,"What is sown without kibbud is raised in kavod.  What is sown in weakness, is raised in ko'ach"
46,15,44,"What is sown a natural guf"
46,15,45,"So, also, it has been written, VAY'HI HAADAM L'NEFESH CHAYYAH"
46,15,46,"But the spiritual guf"
46,15,47,"The Adam haRishon is  AFAR MIN HA'ADAMAH"
46,15,48,"As was the Adam of dust, such also are those of the dust; as was the Adam of Shomayim, such also are those who are of Shomayim;"
46,15,49,"And just as we have bourne the demut of the Adam MIN AFAR HA'ADAMAH"
46,15,50,"Now this I say, Achim b'Moshiach, that basar vadam cannot inherit the Malchut Hashem, neither can the perishable inherit the imperishable"
46,15,51,"Hinei!  I speak a sod"
46,15,52,"In a rega"
46,15,53,"For it is necessary for this perishable nature to put on the  imperishable, and this mortal nature to put on the immortal."
46,15,54,"But when this perishable nature puts on the imperishable, and this mortal, the immortal, then the dvar hanevu'ah will come to pass that stands written, HASHEM BILLA HAMAVET LANETZACH"
46,15,55,"EHI DEVARECHA MAVET EHI KATAVECHA SHEOL? Where are your plagues, O death? Where is your destruction, O sheol? HOSHEA 13:14 [some, sting]?"
46,15,56,"Now the sting of death is chet"
46,15,57,"But  Baruch Hashem, who is giving us the nitzachon"
46,15,58,"So then, Chaverim and Achim b'Moshiach of mine, be steadfast, immovable, abounding always in the avodas kodesh of Adoneinu, have da'asing that your po'al"
46,16,1,"Now, concerning the maamadot"
46,16,2,"Every Yom Rishon"
46,16,3,"And, when I arrive, whomever you approve, these I will send with iggerot to carry your mattanah to Yerushalayim."
46,16,4,"And, if it is fitting for me also to go, they will go with me.  THE JEWISH CALENDAR OF THE REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S SHLIACH AND THIS TACHLIS REGARDING SHAVUOS"
46,16,5,"And I will come to you whenever I pass through Macedonia; for  I will be passing through Macedonia."
46,16,6,"Efsher"
46,16,7,"For I do not want to see you now in passing, for I have the tikvah to remain some time with you, im yirtzeh Hashem"
46,16,8,"But, I will remain on in Ephesus until Shavuos"
46,16,9,"for a delet"
46,16,10,"Now if Timotiyos comes, see that he may be with you without fear; for the avodas kodesh of Hashem he labors in as I do."
46,16,11,"Therefore, let not anyone despise him.  But give him a   send-off in shalom that he may come to me; for I am waiting for him with the Achim b'Moshiach."
46,16,12,"Now, concerning Apollos the Ach b'Moshiach, I strongly exhorted him, that he would come to you with the Achim b'Moshiach.  But he is beshum oifen"
46,16,13,"Watch, stand firm in the  [orthodox Jewish] emunah"
46,16,14,"Let everything you do be done in ahavah"
46,16,15,"Now, I urge you, Achim b'Moshiach, you have da'as the bais of Stephanas, that it is the bikkurim of Achaia, and that they have with devotion and zerizut"
46,16,16,"Become nichna"
46,16,17,"Now, I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and of Fortunatus and of Achaicus, because these men filled up absence,"
46,16,18,"for, they refreshed my neshamah and yours.  Give hokara"
46,16,19,"Shalom greetings from the kehillot of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach of Asia. Aquila and Prisca send shalom greetings warmly in Adoneinu, together with the edah  HaMoshiach"
46,16,20,"All the Achim b'Moshiach send you shalom greetings.  Greet one another with a neshikat Hakodesh"
46,16,21,"THE GREETING WITH MY OWN HAND--SHA'UL."
46,16,22,"If anyone does not ahavah"
46,16,23,"The Chen v'Chesed Hashem of the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu be with you."
46,16,24,"My ahavah be with you all in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua."
47,1,1,"From Sha'ul, a shliach of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua through the birtson Hashem, and Timotiyos, the Ach b'Moshiach; To the Kehillah"
47,1,2,"Chen v'Chesed Hashem to you and shalom from Elohim Avinu and Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua. MODEH ANI AFTER REDIFAH;  SHA'UL, NOW WITH PERSONAL DA'AS OF THE REASON WHY HE WAS PREVIOUSLY FORBIDDEN TO ENTER ASIA"
47,1,3,"Baruch hu Hashem Elohim Avi Adoneinu Yehoshua, Avi haRachamim vaElohei kol nechamah"
47,1,4,"the one giving us chizzuk with respect to all our tzoros so as to enable us to give chizzuk to the ones experiencing tzoros, and that through the nechamah"
47,1,5,"This is so because as the Chevlei Moshiach"
47,1,6,"Now if we are experiencing tzoros, it is for your chizzuk and Yeshu'at Eloheinu; or if we are being given nechamah"
47,1,7,"And our tikvah"
47,1,8,"For we do not want you to lack da'as, Achim, b'Moshiach, as to the tzoros and tribulation that came upon us in Asia [Act 19:23; I Cor. 15:32], that utterly beyond our strength we were burdened, causing us to come to a feeling of yiyush"
47,1,9,"But we ourselves have had the gezar din"
47,1,10,"The same G-d out of so great a Mavet delivered us and will continue to deliver us.  We have set tikvateinu that He will yet deliver us, [II Tim. 4:18]"
47,1,11,"as you also labor together for us by techinnah"
47,1,12,"For our glorying is in this: the edut"
47,1,13,"For we write nothing so shver"
47,1,14,"as you have already had da'as of us in part--as also we are your kavod [II Cor. 5:12], even as also you are ours in the Yom Hashem of Adoneinu Yehoshua. [Php 2:16]"
47,1,15,"And with this bittachon I planned previously to come to you, that a second benefit you might have."
47,1,16,"It was my chesbon"
47,1,17,"This was my mattarah"
47,1,18,"Al emunat Hashem, our dvar to you has not been Ken and Lo."
47,1,19,"For the Ben haElohim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, the One having been proclaimed among you by us, Sila and Timotiyos and I [Act 18:5], was not Ken and Lo; but in Him it is always Ken."
47,1,20,"For in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach every one of Hashem's havtachot"
47,1,21,"But it is Hashem who establishes us with you in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and has given us the mishchah"
47,1,22,"having put his chatam [seal of ownership--Bereshis 38:18; Yechezkel 9:4; Eph 1:13; 4:30; Rev 7:4] on us and having given the eravon"
47,1,23,"Now, I call upon Hashem as eidus"
47,1,24,"Not that we play the macher over your emunah"
47,2,1,"For I decided this in myself, not again to come to you in agmat nemesh. [I Cor. 4:21; II Cor. 12:21]"
47,2,2,"For if I grieve you, then who is the one cheering me except the one I have caused to have agmat nefesh?"
47,2,3,"And I wrote the iggeret as I did, so that when I came, I should not have agmat nefesh from those who should have brought me simchah; for I have bittachon about you all, that my simchah is that of all of you."
47,2,4,"For out of much tzoros and distress of lev"
47,2,5,"Now if anyone has caused agmat nefesh, it is not me he has grieved, but -- to some extent, not to be to severe -- he has grieved you all. [I Cor 5:1]"
47,2,6,"Sufficient to such a man was this onesh"
47,2,7,"so that, on the contrary, rather you ought to give selichah and chizzuk to him lest efsher"
47,2,8,"Therefore I urge you to confirm to him your ahavah"
47,2,9,"I wrote the iggeret to this end, that I may have da'as that you are tested and proven, that in all things you have mishma'at"
47,2,10,"Now to anyone you give selichah of anything, I do as well, for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is for your sake in the presence of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach;"
47,2,11,"lest we should be outsmarted by HaSatan [Luk 22:31]; for we do not lack da'as of his kesharim."
47,2,12,"But having come to Troas for the Besuras Hageulah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and a delet"
47,2,13,"I did not have shalom in my neshamah when I was not able to find Titos my ach b'Moshiach. So I took leave of them and I went on to Macedonia. [Acts 20:1] REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S PROGRAM OF KIRUV RECHOKIM"
47,2,14,"But Baruch Hashem, the One in whom didan notzakh"
47,2,15,"For we are the aroma of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to Hashem among the ones coming to yeshu'at Eloheinu and among the ones perishing; [I Cor. 1:18; Dan. 12:2]"
47,2,16,"to the latter ones a fragrance of mavet unto mavet; but to the former ones a fragrance of Chayyim"
47,2,17,"For we are not as many, peddling the dvar Hashem, but as from sincerity, as from Hashem, in the presence of Hashem, in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach we speak. [II Cor. 1:12; I Pet. 4:11]"
47,3,1,"Do we begin again to commend ourselves? [II Cor. 5:12] Or surely we do not need, as some do, commendatory iggrot to you or from you? [Acts 18:27; Rom 16:1]"
47,3,2,"You are our iggeret, written on our levavot, being known and being read by kol beni Adam. [I Cor. 9:2]"
47,3,3,"And you show that you are an iggeret from Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, prepared by us, having been written not with ink but with the Ruach Hakodesh of the Elohim Chayyim, not on luchot of stone [Shemot 24:12; 31:18; 32:15,16; 34:1; Devarim 9:10,11] but  on luchot of lev basar. [Mishle 3:3; 7:3; Yirmeyah 31:33; Yechezkel 11:19; 36:26] THE BRIT CHADASHA AND ITS AVODAS KODESH; WHEN MOSHE RABBEINU WENT IN BEFORE THE L-RD, MOSHE TOOK THE VEIL OFF; IN THE SAME WAY, WHOEVER TURNS TO THE L-RD, HAS THE VEIL TAKEN AWAY"
47,3,4,"Such is the bittachon that we have through Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach toward Hashem."
47,3,5,"Not that we are competent from ourselves to claim anything as of ourselves, but our competence is from Hashem, [II Cor 2:16]"
47,3,6,"who also made us competent as klei kodesh mesharetim"
47,3,7,"Now if the sherut of mavet chiseled in letters engraved on luchot of stone came with kavod"
47,3,8,"then how much more will the avodas kodesh ministry of the Ruach Hakodesh come in kavod"
47,3,9,"For if there was kavod in the sherut of haresha'ah"
47,3,10,"For indeed what once had kavod has lost its kavod [Shemot 34:29-30]  on account of the surpassing kavod"
47,3,11,"For if the thing, which now is fading away, came with kavod"
47,3,12,"Since, then, we have such a tikvah"
47,3,13,"And we are not as Moshe Rabbeinu, who was putting HAMMASVEH AL PANAV"
47,3,14,"But their minds were hardened; [Rom. 11:25] for until the present day the same veil remains at the keri'atha Torah"
47,3,15,"For until today, whenever Moshe Rabbeinu is being read, a veil lies on their levavot."
47,3,16,"But whenever one turns to Adoneinu HAMMASVEH is taken away. [Shemot 34:34; Yeshayah 25:7; Rom. 11:23-26]"
47,3,17,"Now Adoneinu is Ha Ruach and where Ha Ruach Adoneinu is, there is cherut"
47,3,18,"Now all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the kavod of Adoneinu [Shemot 16:7; 24:17] reflected in a mirror, are being transformed into the same demut from kavod"
47,4,1,"Therefore, since it is by the chesed of Hashem that we have this sherut, this kehunnah, [II Cor 3:16] we do not lose chozek. [Tehillim 18:45; Yeshayah 40:31]"
47,4,2,"But we renounced the things nistar"
47,4,3,"But if indeed our Besuras haGeulah is nistar, it is nistar  among the ones perishing , [I Cor 1:18]"
47,4,4,"in whose case the g-d of the Olam Hazeh"
47,4,5,"For we preach not ourselves but Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach  Adoneinu Yehoshua and ourselves as your avadim"
47,4,6,"Because Hashem is the one who said,Let Ohr shine out of choshech [Bereshis 1:3; Yeshayah 9:2] who shone in our levavot for an illumination of the da'as of the kavod of Hashem in the face of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua. [II Cor. 3:18]"
47,4,7,"Now we have this otzar"
47,4,8,"Being oppressed on every side  [II Cor. 1:8; 7;5] but not being crushed, being perplexed but not in yi'ush"
47,4,9,"being persecuted but not forsaken, being cast down but not  destroyed, [Tehillim 37:24; Mishle 24:16]"
47,4,10,"always bearing about the dying of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach in my guf"
47,4,11,"For always we, the ones living, are being given over to mavet because of Moshiach [Rom 8:36; I Cor. 15:31] that also the Chayyim of Moshiach may be manifested in our mortal basar."
47,4,12,"So then death works in us but Chayyim in you."
47,4,13,"And having the same Ruach Hakodesh of emunah"
47,4,14,"having da'as that the one having raised Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua us also with Yehoshua will raise and will present us with you. [Rom. 8:11; I Cor. 6:14; 15:15,20]"
47,4,15,"For all things are because of you [II Cor. 1:3-6] that the Chen v'Chesed Hashem, having increased through the many, may increase the hodayah"
47,4,16,"Therefore we do not lose chozek. For, indeed, even if our outward man is becoming old and atrophied, yet our inward man is yom yom being renewed. [Eph. 3:16] [Tehillim 18:45; 103:5; Yeshayah 40:31]"
47,4,17,"For our present momentary tzoros is preparing us for an eternal weight of kavod"
47,4,18,"for while we are not looking at the visible things but the invisible; [Col. 1:16; Heb. 11:1,3] for the things visible are zemanniyim"
47,5,1,"For we have da'as that if our beit mishkaneinu [Iyov 4:19; II Cor.4:7] is made churban, we have a bais from Hashem, a bais not made with hands, in Shomayim L'olamim. [Yeshayah 38:12]"
47,5,2,"For indeed in this mishkaneinu we groan, longing for the train of our robe to be our sukkah from shomayim. [Rom. 8:23]"
47,5,3,"-- if indeed thus clothed we will not be found naked."
47,5,4,"For while we are still in this Mishkan, we groan under our burden, in as much as we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, that the mortal may be swallowed up by chayyim.  [I Cor. 15:53-54]"
47,5,5,"Now the one having prepared us for this very thing is Hashem, the One having given us the eravon"
47,5,6,"Therefore we always have bittachon, since we have da'as that being at home in the guf"
47,5,7,"For we walk by emunah"
47,5,8,"therefore we have bittachon and are pleased rather to leave home from the guf"
47,5,9,"Therefore, also we are aspiring, whether at home or away from home to be well pleasing to Hashem, [Col. 1:10; I Thes 4:1]"
47,5,10,"since it is necessary for all of us to be revealed for an appearance before the Kisse Din of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach"
47,5,11,"Therefore, since we have da'as of the yirat [Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach] Adoneinu, we persuade men, and we have been made manifest to Hashem and I have tikvah"
47,5,12,"We are not commending ourselves to you again [II Cor 3:1],  but are giving an opportunity to you of glorying on behalf of us [II Cor.1:14] that you may respond to those who glory in appearance and not in lev."
47,5,13,"For if we seem meshuga, it is for Hashem; if we are in our right mind, it is for you."
47,5,14,"For the ahavah"
47,5,15,"And Moshiach died, on behalf of all, [I Tim 2:6] that the ones living may live no longer to themselves but to the one [Moshiach] who died on behalf of them has been made to stand up alive in his techiyas hamesim.  [Rom 14:7-8]"
47,5,16,"From now on, therefore, we have da'as of no one from a purely human point of view; if indeed we have had da'as of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach according to the basar we now no longer so have da'as of him,"
47,5,17,"so that if anyone is in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, he is a bria chadasha"
47,5,18,"And all things are of Hashem, who is the one having granted to us ritztzuy"
47,5,19,"davka"
47,5,20,"On behalf of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, therefore, we are emissaries of shalom [Yeshayah 27:5; 52:7; Eph. 6:20], as if Hashem were entreating through us: we ask on behalf of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, be reconciled to Hashem."
47,5,21,"The one who in his person was without da'as of chet"
47,6,1,"As we work together with him, we also urge you not to recieve the Chen v'Chesed Hashem in vain. [II Cor 5:20]"
47,6,2,"For he says B'ET RATZON ANITICHA UV'YOM Y'SHUAH AZARTICHAH (In a time acceptable I heard you and in a day of salvation I helped you [YESHAYAH 49:8]. Hinei, now is the acceptable time;  now is Yom Yeshu'ah. Tehillim 69:13; Yeshayah 55:6 Luk 4:19-21]"
47,6,3,"not giving in anything a cause for michshol, lest the Messianic Avodas Kodesh"
47,6,4,"but in everything presenting ourselves [II Cor 4:2] as mesharetim of Hashem -- in much savlanut, in tzoros, in hardships, in distresses,"
47,6,5,"in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in tzomot, [II Cor. 11:23-27]"
47,6,6,"in purity, in da'as, in long-suffering, in chesed, in the Ruach Hakodesh, in ahavah amittit, [I Tim 4:12]"
47,6,7,"in the dvar HaEmes, in the gevurat Hashem, [I Cor 2:4] through the weapons of Tzedek [DANIEL 9:25] of the right hand and of the left."
47,6,8,"Through honor and dishonor, through ill repute and good repute; as deceivers and yet true,"
47,6,9,"as being unknown and yet being well known, as dying and hinei, we live! [II Cor 4:10]...As given the death penalty and yet not penalized wiht death [Tehillim 118:18]"
47,6,10,"as having agmat nefesh but always having simcha [II Cor 7:4; Php 2:17; Col 1:24; I Thes 1:6] as poor but enriching many, as having nothing and yet possessing everything."
47,6,11,"We have spoken freely with you Corinthians, our levavot has been enlarged."
47,6,12,"There is no penury in our affections, only in yours."
47,6,13,"Now--I speak as to yeladim--make a fair exchange and open wide your levavot [I Cor 4:14].  THE BEIS HAMIKDASH OF HASHEM"
47,6,14,"Do not become unequally yoked with koferim"
47,6,15,"And what harmony does Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach have with B'liya'al? Or what chelek"
47,6,16,"And what agreement has the heikhal of Hashem with elilim?  For we are a heikhal of the Elohim Chayyima [I Cor. 3:16; 6:19] as Hashem, V'HITHALECHTI B'TOCHCHEM (And I will walk in the midst of you [VAYIKRA 26:12] I WILL BE MISHKANI ALEHEM"
47,6,17,"Therefore SURU come out from the midst of them and be separated says Adoneinu and an TAMEH AL TIGAU unclean thing do not touch; [YESHAYAH 52:11] ERTZEH ETCHEM and I will receive you [YECHEZKEL 20:34,41; Rev.18:4]"
47,6,18,"and I will be to you an AV and you will be to me BANIM and BANOT (my daughters [SHEMUEL BAIS 7:8,14; YESHAYAH 43:6; YIRMEYAH 31:9] says Adonoi Tzva'ot. [Shemot 4:22; Divrey Hayamim Alef 17:13; AMOS 3:13 LXX 4:13 LXX Rev 4:8; 11:17; 15:3; 21:22]"
47,7,1,"Therefore, having these havtachot"
47,7,2,"In your levavot make a cheder for us; we wronged no one, we ruined no one, we exploited no one.  [II Cor 12:17]"
47,7,3,"I do not say this to bring you under haresha'ah, for I have said before that you are in our levavot [II Cor. 6:11-12; Php 1:7] whether to die with you or to live with you. [Shmuel Beis 15:21]"
47,7,4,"I have much ometz lev toward you, I glory much on your behalf; I have been filled with chozek, I am filled to overflowing with simcha at all of our tzoros."
47,7,5,"For indeed when we had come into Macedonia [Act 20:1-2; II Cor. 2:13] we had no physical mano'ach but we had tzoros everywhere: battles on the outside, fears inside. [Devarim 32:25]"
47,7,6,"But Hashem who encouraging the lowly, encouraged us [Yeshayah 49:13; II Cor. 1:3-4] by the coming of Titos,"
47,7,7,"and not only by the coming of him, but also by the encouragement by which he was encouraged over you, reporting to us your longing, your mourning, your kanous"
47,7,8,"Because if indeed I caused you agmat nefesh by the iggeret, I do not regret it; though I did regret it, but I see that that iggeret grieved you only briefly; [II Cor 2:4]"
47,7,9,"Now I have simcha, not that you had agmat nefesh, but that your grief brough you to teshuva, for your agmat nefesh was in Hashem, so that by us you suffered in nothing."
47,7,10,"For the agmat nefesh that is according to Hashem produces teshuva to Yeshu'at Eloheinu, not to be regretted, but the agmat nefesh of the Olam Hazeh produces mavet. [Mat. 27:3-5; Heb 12:17]"
47,7,11,"For, hinei, see what zerizut"
47,7,12,"Then though I wrote an iggeret to you, it was not for the sake of the one having done resha, nor for the sake of the one who was beleidikt"
47,7,13,"In this we have chozek.  But in addititon to our encouragement, we had still more simcha at the simcha of Titos, because his neshamah has been set at rest by all of you;"
47,7,14,"Because if I have been somewhat boastful about you Corinthians to Titos, I was in this not put to shame, but just as everything we said to you is HaEmes, so also our boasting to Titos has proven true as well."
47,7,15,"And his lev"
47,7,16,"I have simcha that in everything I have bittachon in you."
47,8,1,"Now we make known to you, Achim b'Moshiach, the Chen v'Chesed Hashem that was granted to Moshiach's Kehillot of Macedonia,"
47,8,2,"that during a great ordeal of tzoros, their abundant simcha and the extreme depth their aniyyut"
47,8,3,"that according to their ability, I give solemn edut, and ad kdei kach"
47,8,4,"begging us, requesting from us the privilege of participating in giving tzedakah to the Messianic Jewish ministry of the kedoshim [Rom 15:26; Acts 11:29; II Cor 9:1]"
47,8,5,"and this not merely according to tikvateinu; they gave themselves barishonah to Adoneinu and to us [Moshiach's Shluchim] by the ratzon of Hashem,"
47,8,6,"so that it was necessary for us to urge Titos that as he began and made a haschala"
47,8,7,"Now just as you abound in everything--in emunah, in torah, in da'as [I Cor. 1:5] and in all zerizut"
47,8,8,"I do not lay this out as a mitzvah, but the amittiyyut"
47,8,9,"for you have da'as of the Chen v'Chesed of Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, who, though being rich, for your sakes, he became poor, [Mt. 8:20; Phil. 2:6-7] that you by Moshiach's aniyyut"
47,8,10,"And in this I give my etza"
47,8,11,"Now also complete what you started!  Then your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your finishing it from what you have. [Shemot 25:2]"
47,8,12,"For if the readiness is already present, it is acceptable according to whatever one may have--not according to what one does not have. [Mishle 3:27-28; Mk 12:43]"
47,8,13,"For it is not that there should be relief to others and distress and tzoros to you, but that there should be a balance of equality"
47,8,14,"during the present time of your abundance for those who lack, and also for your lack there may be their abundance, [II Cor.9:12] so also there may be equality,"
47,8,15,"as it has been written V'LO HE'DIF HAMARBEH V'HAMAMIT LO HECHESIR."
47,8,16,"But Baruch Hashem, the One having given the same zerizut"
47,8,17,"because of the chozek"
47,8,18,"And we sent with him the Ach b'Moshiach who is bakante"
47,8,19,"and not only this but also this Ach b'Moshiach has been hand picked by the Kehillot to travel with us and with this avodas kodesh of chesed being administered by us to the kavod of Adoneinu himself and as an edut"
47,8,20,"Avoiding also that anyone should murmur about our handling of this liberal mattanah"
47,8,21,"for our tachlis is to do what is tov me'od not only B'EINEI ELOHIM V'ADAM. [Mishle 3:4 Targum Ha-Shivim]"
47,8,22,"And we sent with them our Ach b'Moshiach whom we have often tested and found having zerizut in much, and now having even more zerizut by his great bittachon in you."
47,8,23,"As for Titos, he is my shutaf and your fellow po'el in your avodas kodesh; as for our Achim b'Moshiach, they are shluchim of the Kehillot, the kavod of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
47,8,24,"Therefore, openly before the Moshiach's Kehillot, demonstrate your ahavah and vindicate our glorying about you   [II Cor. 7:14]."
47,9,1,"Concerning your Messianic avodas kodesh sherut for the kedoshim [II Cor. 8:4,20] it is superfluous for me to send you this iggeret."
47,9,2,"For I have da'as of your readiness to involve yourself in Messianic Jewish ministry and this is the subject of my glorying to the Macedonians, saying that Achaia has been prepared vi-bahlt"
47,9,3,"And I am sending the Achim b'Moshiach lest our glorying on behalf of you should be made empty in this respect, that you be ready, as I was saying you would be,"
47,9,4,"lest perhaps if some Macedonians should come with me and they find you unprepared, we should have bushah, to say nothing of you, in this situation."
47,9,5,"Therefore, I considered it necessary to encourage the Achim b'Moshiach, that they should go on ahead to you and, having arranged in advance the bountiful terumah"
47,9,6,"Note this: the one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly,  and the one sowing for a beracha of bounty will also reap a beracha of bounty. [Mishle 11:24,25; 22:9]"
47,9,7,"Each of you should give as he has decided previously in his lev"
47,9,8,"And Hashem is able to cause to abound to you all Chen v'Chesed Hashem that in everything, always, having all sufficiency, you may abound to every mitzvah."
47,9,9,"as it has been written, PIZAR NATAN LAEVYONIM TZIDKATO OMEDET LA'AD He scattered, he gave to the poor, His Righteousness endures forever. [TEHILLIM 112:9 Malachi 3:10]"
47,9,10,"Now the one supplying ZERA"
47,9,11,"you will be enriched in everything to all ma'aseh chesed"
47,9,12,"Because the avodas kodesh of this tzedakah is not only filling up the things lacking of the kedoshim, [II Cor 8:14] but is also abounding through hodayah rabbah"
47,9,13,"through the proof of this Messianic Jewish sherut you bring kavod to Hashem on the basis of your submission to your Ani Ma'amin Hoda'a of the Besuras HaGeulah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and on the basis of ma'aseh chesed"
47,9,14,"And, reciprocally, the Messianic Jews in Yerushalayim will daven in intercession for you, having great ahavah in Moshiach for you, because of the surpassing Chen v'Chesed Hashem upon you."
47,9,15,"Baruch Hashem for his indescribable mattanah!"
47,10,1,"Now I myself, Sha'ul, appeal to you gently in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and in his anavah"
47,10,2,"--now I beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show enough chutzpah to oppose certain persons, [I Cor. 4:21] the ones considering us to act according to the standards of the basar of Olam Hazeh."
47,10,3,"For though walking in basar, we war not according to the basar,"
47,10,4,"for the weapons of our warfare are not of the basar [Eph. 6:13-17], but full of ko'ach through Hashem to the overthrow of strongholds, overthrowing reasonings [Yirmeyah 1:10; 23:29] BRING EVERY THOUGHT CAPTIVE FOR TIKKUN"
47,10,5,"and every high-minded thing rising up against the da'as of Hashem, and leading captive every machashavah"
47,10,6,"and prepared to discipline all disobedience whenever your mishma'at"
47,10,7,"You look at things according to outward appearance.  If anyone has persuaded himself that he belongs to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, have zikaron of this: as he is of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, so also are we."
47,10,8,"Now even if I should glory a little too much [II Cor 12:6] in our samchut"
47,10,9,"I did not intend to seem as if my iggrot were meant to frighten you."
47,10,10,"For they say, His iggrot indeed are weighty and strong but his physical presence is weak and his shprach, as far as rhetoric is concerned, is despicable."
47,10,11,"Let such a one consider this: that the dvar we speak through iggrot when absent will become ma'aseh we will very well do when present! [II Cor 13:2,10]"
47,10,12,"For we dare not to make a geder"
47,10,13,"But we will not boast out of our depth, but will be shomer to keep within the sadeh"
47,10,14,"For we were not getting out of our depth when we reached even as far as you.  We were the chalutzim who came with th Besuras HaGeulah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, EVIL PO'ALIM"
47,10,15,"We do not boast out of our depth, that is, in the labor of others; but the tikvateinu is that, as your emunah grows, our sphere of Shlichut among you will also be enlarged,"
47,10,16,"so that we may abundantly proclaim the Besuras HaGeulah [Acts 19:21] to the regions beyond you, without boasting in someone else's Messianic chalutz accomplishments."
47,10,17,"But HAMMIT HALLELYIT HALLEL;"
47,10,18,"For it is not the one commending himself that is approved, but it is the one whom [Moshiach] Adoneinu commends. [I Cor. 4:4-5]"
47,11,1,"I would that you might bear with me in a little tipshus"
47,11,2,"For I have kinah for you a kinat Hashem, for, as a shadhan"
47,11,3,"but I fear lest somehow as the Nachash deceived Chavah by his cunning [Bereshis 3:1-6,13] your machshavot should be led astray from a simple and pure devekut to Hashem's Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
47,11,4,"For if someone shows up and preaches another Moshiach, another Yehoshua, than the one in our drashot, or if you receive a different Ruach Hakodesh from the one you received or a different Besuras HaGeulah from the one regarding which you were mekabel, you put up with that well enough. [Gal.1:8-9]"
47,11,5,"For I consider to have come behind the most groise"
47,11,6,"But if indeed I am unskilled in lashon [I Cor 1:17; 2:1,13] yet I am not in da'as"
47,11,7,"Or--anshuldiks!"
47,11,8,"I robbed other of Moshiach's Kehillot, did I, in taking wages from them for the avodas kodesh work I did for you? [Php 4:15]"
47,11,9,"And when I was present with you and I had lack, I did not burden anyone [II Cor. 12:13], for my lack was made up by the Achim b'Moshiach who came from Macedonia.  So I was shomer not to make myself a buden to you and in that I will remain shomer."
47,11,10,"As HaEmes of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is in me, that particular boasting of mine will not be silenced [I Cor 9:15] in in the regions of Achaia!"
47,11,11,"Why?  Because I do not have ahavah for you?  Hashem knows that I do!"
47,11,12,"But what I do I will also continue to do in order to deny an opening to those who are looking for an opening by their boasting to be recognized as equals with us."
47,11,13,"For such ones are shlichei sheker, deceitful po'alim, [Php 3:2],  transforming themselves in a masquerade as shluchim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
47,11,14,"And no wonder!  For even Hasatan transforms himself into a malach of ohr"
47,11,15,"It is no big megillah, therefore, if also Hasatan's ministers transform themselves as ministers of Tzedek [DANIEL 9:25].  Their end will be according to their ma'asim. THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE TRUE SHLIACH ENTAIL MORE THAN BEING MERELY FARNUMEN"
47,11,16,"Listen here, let no one think me a tipesh"
47,11,17,"What I speak in this bittachon of boasting, I speak not according to Moshiach Adoneinu, but as a yold."
47,11,18,"Als"
47,11,19,"For magnanimously you put up with fools, being such talmidei chachomim yourselves!"
47,11,20,"For you put up with it quite well, if anyone trades you into slavery, if anyon turns you into their supper, if anyone lifts your wallet, if anyone exalts himself into your macher, if anyone gives you a klop in the ponem."
47,11,21,"To my bushah, I say that we were too weak for that!  But, nevertheless, in whatever way anyone may have chutzpah in foolishness, I also will speak with chutzpah."
47,11,22,"Are they Ivrim?  So am I.  Are they Yisre'elim?  So am I.  Are they Zera Avraham?  So am I. [Php 3:5]"

48,1,9,"As we have previously said, and now again I say, if any one preaches a Besuras haGeulah to you other than that which you received, let him be ARUR HAISH and be consigned to onesh Gehinnom. NOW, HAVING PRONOUNCED THE PUNISHMENT OF CHEREM, AM I TO BE JUDGED A MAN-PLEASER?  YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW I BECAME A SHLIACH OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH!"

48,1,18,"Then, after shalosh shanim"
48,1,19,"But other of the Moshiach's Shluchim I did not see except Ya'akov achi Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu."

48,2,9,"And realizing the Chen v'Chesed Hashem having been given to me, Ya'akov and Kefa and Yochanan, the men of repute, the ones seeming to be Ammudei haKehillah"
48,2,10,"only that we should remember the Aniyim"
48,2,11,"But when Kefa came to Antioch, I stood against him to his face, because there was found in him a dvar ashmah"

48,2,17,"Now, if, by seeking to be YITZDAK IM HASHEM in Moshiach, we ourselves were found also to be chatta'im"
48,2,18,"For if what I destroyed, these things I again rebuild"
48,2,19,"For I, through the Torah"

48,3,3,"You lack seychel; having begun in the Ruach haKodesh, will you now be perfected in the basar?"
48,3,4,"Did you suffer so many things lashav"

48,3,7,"know then, that the ones of emunah, these ones are the Bnei haAvraham Avinu! THE BERACHAH OF AVRAHAM AVINU AND YITZDAK IM HASHEM COMES ONLY TO THE MA'AMINIM B'MOSHIACH, THE ONE WHO BECAME A KELALAH FOR US, THE ONE, THE ONLY ONE, WHO YA'ASEH OTAM VACHAI"
48,3,8,"And the Kitvei haKodesh, having foreseen that Hashem would yatzdik"
48,3,9,"For this reason, the ones of emunah receive the berachah"
48,3,10,"For as many as are"
48,3,11,"Now it is clear that not one person is YITZDAK IM HASHEM"

48,3,21,"Is the Torah, mimeila"
48,3,22,"But the Kitvei haKodesh consigned all things under HaChet"
48,3,23,"But before Emunah came, we were being held in custody, being confined and guarded for the about-to-be-revealed Emunah."
48,3,24,"This is the result:  the Torah functioned as our omenet"
48,3,25,"But Emunah having come, we are no longer under an omenet."
48,3,26,"For through emunah in Moshiach Yehoshua, you are all bnei Elohim.  THE MIKVEH MAYIM OF MOSHIACH AND THE TEVILAH INTO HIM WITH THE NEW ESCHATOLOGICAL EXISTENCE OF THE OLAM HABA INTO WHICH WE BY EMUNAH ARE JUSTIFIED-REGENERATED EVEN NOW, WITH THE TURNING OF THE AGES IN MOSHIACH CHANGING EVERYTHING, SINCE MOSHIACH IS AVRAHAM'S ZERAH, AND SINCE WE, WHETHER YEHUDIM OR GOYIM, PARTICIPATE IN MOSHIACH BY EMUNAH, AND ARE THEREFORE ALSO ABRAHAM'S OFFSPRING; CONCLUSION: YOU GALATIAN GOYIM ARE ABRAHAM'S OFFSPRING BY EMUNAH IN MOSHIACH AND DON'T NEED THE MOHALIM HAGOYIM, AND THIS IS THE TRUE ORTHODOX JEWISH FAITH, SO DON'T SUBMIT TO THEIR BESURAS HAGEULAH OR THEIR BRIS MILAH"
48,3,27,"For as many as have had a tevilah immersion into Moshiach have clothed yourselves with Moshiach."
48,3,28,"There is not Yehudi  nor Yevani"
48,3,29,"And, if you belong to Moshiach"
48,4,1,"Now I say this: for however much time as the yoresh"
48,4,2,"And he is under shomrim"
48,4,3,"So also we, when we were immature, had been enslaved under the yesodot"
48,4,4,"But when the fullness of time had come, Hashem sent forth his Ben haElohim [Moshiach, SHMUEL BAIS 7:14; TEHILLIM 2:7; 89:27f], born of an isha"
48,4,5,"that Moshiach might bring the Geulah"
48,4,6,"And because you are banim, Hashem sent forth the Ruach of His Ben haElohim into your levavot, crying Abba, Avinu! THE SHLIACH SHA'UL DEALS WITH THE GALATIAN GOYIM AS A MASHGIACH RUCHANI"
48,4,7,"So you are no longer an eved but a ben; and if a ben, also a yoresh through Hashem."
48,4,8,"But, formerly, when you did not have da'as"
48,4,9,"But, now, having known Hashem, or rather having been known by Hashem, how is it that you are returning to the weak and beggarly yesodot"
48,4,10,"You observe yamim"
48,4,11,"I fear for you, lest somehow efsher"
48,4,12,"Become as I am, because I also became as you are, Achim B'Moshiach.  I implore you.  You did me no wrong."
48,4,13,"And you know that it was due to chulshat habasar"
48,4,14,"and your nissayon"
48,4,15,"Where then is your birkat Shomayim"
48,4,16,"So, then, have I become your oyev"

48,4,18,"Now it is tov ma'od to be zealous in a good thing all the time, and not only during my presence with you."
48,4,19,"My yeladim, for whom again I suffer chevlei"
48,4,20,"would that I were present with you just now and could change my tone, because I am baffled with you. RAV SHA'UL IS MEDAMEH"
48,4,21,"Tell me, you Goyim who wish to be under the Torah, do you not possess shema hearing of the Torah?"
48,4,22,"For the Torah says that Avraham Avinu had shnei banim"
48,4,23,"But the one of the slave woman has been born according to the basar, and the one of the free woman has been born through the havtachah"
48,4,24,"Now these things can be taken derech mashal"
48,4,25,"Now, Hagar is the Mount Sinai in Arabia; and corresponds to the Yerushalayim of now, for she is in avdut with her banim."
48,4,26,"But the Yerushalayim above is a bat chorin"
48,4,27,"For it has been written, RANNI AKARAH LO YALADAH PITZCHI RINNAH V'TZAHALI LO CHALAH KI RABBIM BENEI SHOMEMAH MIB'NEI VE'ULAH"
48,4,28,"But you, Achim b'Moshiach, are Bnei haHavtacha"
48,4,29,"But just as at that time the one born according to the basar was bringing redifah"
48,4,30,"But what does the Kitvei haKodesh say? GARESH HA'AMAH HAZOT V'ES B'NAH KI LO YIRASH BEN-HA'AMAH HAZOT IM BENI"
48,4,31,"Therefore, Achim B'Moshiach, we are not Bnei haAmah"
48,5,1,"For this deror"
48,5,2,"Hinei! I, Sha'ul, say to you, that if you Goyim undergo the bris milah, Moshiach will profit you nothing [3:12-14]."
48,5,3,"And I testify again to every one of you undergoing bris milah that such is chal"
48,5,4,"You who want to be YITZDAK IM HASHEM"
48,5,5,"For we by the Ruach Hakodesh eagerly await by emunah the tikvah haTzedek"
48,5,6,"For in Moshiach Yehoshua neither bris milah is of any force nor the lack of it, but emunah working through ahavah"
48,5,7,"You were running well: who hindered you from being persuaded by haEmes?"
48,5,8,"This persuasion is not of the One calling you."
48,5,9,"A little chametz leavens all the dough."
48,5,10,"I have bittachon in you in Adoneinu that nothing other you will think, but the one troubling you will bear the judgement, whoever he may be."
48,5,11,"But if I preach [to Goyim] the bris milah, Achim B'Moshiach, why am I still being persecuted? In that case, the michshol"
48,5,12,"O if the ones"
48,5,13,"For, Achim B'Moshiach, you were called for Cherut"
48,5,14,"For the entire Torah has been summed up in one word: V'AHAVTA L'RE'ACHA KAMOCHA"
48,5,15,"But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another.  A FINAL WORD TO THE TRUE BA'AL TESHUVA IN MOSHIACH: MUSSAR"
48,5,16,"But I say, walk by the Ruach haKodesh, and by no means will you carry out the ta'avot of the basar."
48,5,17,"For the basar desires against the Ruach haKodesh, and the Ruach haKodesh desires against the basar"
48,5,18,"But if by the Ruach haKodesh you are led, you are not under the Torah."
48,5,19,"Now the ma'asei habasar are manifest, dehainu"
48,5,20,"avodah zarah"
48,5,21,"tzarut ayin"
48,5,22,"But the p'ri of the Ruach haKodesh is ahavah"
48,5,23,"anavah, shlitah atzmi..."
48,5,24,"But the ones of Moshiach Yehoshua have pierced and put to death on the Aitz"
48,5,25,"If we live by the Ruach haKodesh, we should stay in line with the Derech haYashar"
48,5,26,"Let us not become ba'alei ga'avah"
48,6,1,"Achim B'Moshiach, if indeed a man is overtaken in some averah, you ones with ruchniyus restore such a one in a spirit of anavah, watching out for yourself lest also you come under nissayon"
48,6,2,"Bear one another's burdens"
48,6,3,"For if anyone thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself."
48,6,4,"But let each man prove his own ma'aseh and then in his own ma'asim rather than in that of his re'a"
48,6,5,"For each man must bear his own load."
48,6,6,"And let the one being taught limudei kodesh"
48,6,7,"Do not be led astray. Hashem is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, this also he will reap."
48,6,8,"For the one sowing to the basar of himself, of the basar will reap churban"
48,6,9,"Now let us not lose chozek in doing Gemilut Chasadim, for BE'ITO"
48,6,10,"Therefore, then, as we have opportunity, we should do ma'asim tovim towards all, and especially towards the Bnei Beis haEmunah."
48,6,11,"SEE WITH WHAT GROISE LETTERS I WROTE TO YOU WITH MY OWN HAND."
48,6,12,"As many as crave to be good preeners in the basar"
48,6,13,"For not even those of the party of the bris milah are shomer mitzvot themselves; they"
48,6,14,"But may it not be to me to boast, except in the Aitz"
48,6,15,"For neither bris milah is anything, nor fehlt of bris milah, but a Bri'a Chadasha."
48,6,16,"And as many as stay in line with the Derech haYashar"
48,6,17,"For the rest, let no one give me any more tzoros; for I bear in my basar the chabburot haYehoshua"

49,1,3,"Baruch hu Adonoi Avi Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, who has bestowed on us every birkat hanefesh in Shomayim in Moshiach,"
49,1,4,"just as he picked us out to be part of Hashem's Bechirim"
49,1,5,"having provided the yi'ud merosh"
49,1,6,"to the tehilat kavod of the Chen v'Chesed Hashem of him by which he freely favored us in the Moshiach HaAhuv."
49,1,7,"In him we have the pedut"
49,1,8,"which he lavished upon us.  In all chochmah and binah,"
49,1,9,"having made hitgalut to us the raz of his ratzon, according to the chafetz of his ratzon, which Hashem purposed in Moshiach"
49,1,10,"for a pakuddat Hashem"
49,1,11,"In Moshiach we have also obtained a nachalah"

49,1,17,"that Hashem of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua, the Avi Hakavod, may give to you a ruach of chochmah and hitgalut in the da'as of Moshiach.[Shemot 28:3; Yeshayah 11:2]"
49,1,18,"It is my tefillah that the eynayim of your levavot may be  enlightened so that you may have da'as of what is the tikvah of his keri'ah"

49,2,7,"in order that, in the Olam HaBah, he might display the surpassing osher of the Chen v'Chesed Hashem of him in chesed toward us in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua."
49,2,8,"For by unmerited Chen v'Chesed Hashem you have been delivered from Hashem's Din"
49,2,9,"not the result [of the zchus"
49,2,10,"For we are his masterpiece, having been created in Moshiach Yehoshua for ma'asim tovim, which Hashem prepared beforehand, that we should walk our derech in them. [Yeshayah 29:23; 42:7; 60:21;]  ACHDUT IN REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ADONEINU, MOREINU, V'RABBEINU"

49,2,12,"have zikaron that you were at that time bazunder"
49,2,13,"But now in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, you, who formerly where in the outermost courts, have been brought near by the kapparah of the dahm of Moshiach."
49,2,14,"For Moshiach himself is our arbitrating shalom, who made the Shneym into Echad, having broken down the barrier of the Mechitzah, the Eyvah, in the basar of Moshiach,"
49,2,15,"the chok"
49,2,16,"and that Moshiach might bring the ritztzuy"
49,2,17,"And having come, Moshiach preached shalom to you, the ones in the outermost courts, and shalom to the ones near; [Tehillim 148:14; Yeshayah 57:19]"
49,2,18,"because through Moshiach we both have HaSha'ar laHashem"
49,2,19,"Therefore, then, no longer are you zarim and aliens, but you are fellow citizens of the kedoshim and bnei bayit members of the household of G-d,"
49,2,20,"having been built upon the yesod"
49,2,21,"in whom all the binyan"
49,2,22,"in whom also you are being built together into a Mishkan of Hashem in the Ruach Hakodesh."
49,3,1,"For this cause, I, Sha'ul, the prisoner of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua for you Goyim,"
49,3,2,"if indeed you heard of the pakuddat Hashem of the Chen v'Chesed Hashem having been given to me for you,"
49,3,3,"that according to hitgalut there was made known to me the sod of the raz, as I wrote before in brief,"
49,3,4,"as to which you are able by reading to have binah of my haara"
49,3,5,"of which in other dorot was not made known to the bnei Adam as it has now been made hitgalut to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's Shluchim and Nevi'im HaKedoshim in the Ruach Hakodesh,"
49,3,6,"namely, that the Nations are fellow bnei HaYerushsha"
49,3,7,"of which I became a keli kodesh"
49,3,8,"To me, the less than the least of all kedoshim, was given this Chen v'Chesed Hashem, to preach to the Goyim the unsearchable osher of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach,"
49,3,9,"and to shed light on what is the pakuddat Hashem of the Sod  that was meOlam nistar"
49,3,10,"in order that the many-faceted Chochmah Hashem might be made known now to the rulers and the authorities in Shomayim through the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's Brit Chadasha Kehillah."
49,3,11,"This was in accordance with the tochnit Hashem"
49,3,12,"in whom we have boldness and HaSha'ar laHashem"
49,3,13,"Therefore, I ask you not to lose chozek concerning my tzoros on your behalf, which is for your kavod. CHOCHMAH, BINAH, AND DA'AS OF THE AHAVAH OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH"
49,3,14,"For this cause I fall down before HaAv,"
49,3,15,"from whom every mishpochah in Shomayim and on ha'Aretz is named,"
49,3,16,"that he may grant you according to the osher of his kavod to become mightily empowered through his Ruach Hakodesh in the inner man;"
49,3,17,"so that Moshiach may make his maon in your levavot through emunah, being rooted and grounded in ahavah,"
49,3,18,"that you may be able to have binah, together with all the kedoshim, what is the breadth and length and height and depth [Iyov 11:8,9; Tehillim 103:11]"
49,3,19,"and to have da'as of the ahavah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, which ahavah surpasses da'as, in order that you may be filled to all the  melo"

49,4,1,"Therefore I impart chizzuk"

49,4,8,"Therefore it says, ALITA LAMMAROM SHAVITA SHEVI LAKACHTA MATANOT"
49,4,9,"Now if he ASCENDED what can it mean except that also he descended into the lower parts of ha'aretz?"
49,4,10,"The One who descended is himself also the One having ascended far above all the Shomayim, that he might fill all things. [Mishle 30:1-4]  ON THE AVODAS KODESH MINISTRY OF THE BRIT CHADASHA KEHILLAH;    ON THE ACHDUT"
49,4,11,"And he gave some to be shluchim, and some nevi'im, and some gifted to be used in Kiruv efforts for Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and some supervising mashgichim ruchaniyim"
49,4,12,"for the equipping of the kedoshim for the work of avodas kodesh ministry, to the building up of HaGuf HaMoshiach [Bereshis 47:18; Tehillim 16:9-10; Iyov 19:25-27; Yeshayah 53:11]"
49,4,13,"until we all attain to the achdus"
49,4,14,"In this way, we are no longer olalim"
49,4,15,"but telling HaEmes in ahavah, let us grow up in every respect unto him who is the Rosh, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach,"

49,4,23,"and to be renewed by the Ruach Hakodesh controlling your machshavot"
49,4,24,"and to enrobe yourself in the Adam HeChadash"

49,5,27,"that he might present to himself [as a kallah] the Brit Chadasha Kehillah in all her kavod TAMIM"

52,2,20,"For you are our kavod and simcha."
52,3,1,"Therefore, when we could no longer endure it, we resolved to be left behind alone in Athens."
52,3,2,"Also we sent Timotiyos, acheinu"
52,3,3,"This was for the tachlis that no one be unsettled because of ES TZARAH.  For you yourselves have da'as that we have a divine calendar date with ES TZARAH."

52,4,5,"not in the passion of ta'avah"
52,4,6,"that no man commit pesha and take advantage of one of his Achim b'Moshiach in this [sexual] matter, because Hashem is the Nokem"

52,4,10,"For indeed this you do toward all the Achim b'Moshiach in all of Macedonia.  But in this we exhort you, Chaverim, to abound more and more.   YOSHEVIM NEED A PARNASAH IF THEY ARE NOT SUPPORTING THEIR MISHPOCHAH"
52,4,11,"And have as your ambition to lead a quiet life of shalom bayis, and to mind your own business, and to have a parnasah, working with your own hands, according to the mitzvot"

52,4,13,"We do not want you lack da'as, chaverim, concerning those who have fallen asleep.  The tachlis is that you not have agmat nefesh"
52,4,14,"For, if we have an Ani Maamin belief that Yehoshua died and then stood up alive again in Moshiach's techiyas hamesim, even so, Hashem will bring with Him [Moshiach] those who have fallen asleep through Yehoshua."
52,4,15,"For this we say to you by the Dvar Hashem, that we who are alive and have been left behind until the Bias Moshiach Adoneinu, may in no way be kodem"
52,4,16,"For Adoneinu Himself, at the signal, at the voice of the Sar haMalachim"

52,5,3,"Whenever they say, Shalom and Bittachon! then sudden churban"
52,5,4,"But you, Achim b'Moshiach, are not in choshech that the Yom should overtake you like a ganav."
52,5,5,"For all of you are Bnei Ohr and Bnei Yom; we are not of the Lailah nor of the Choshech."
52,5,6,"Therefore, let us not sleep as the rest, but let us keep awake with zililut da'as"
52,5,7,"For the ones sleeping sleep balailah and the ones indulging in shichrut"
52,5,8,"But we, being Bnei Yom, let us be bnei zililut da'as"
52,5,9,"Because Hashem did not appoint us to chori af"
52,5,10,"He is the one who died on our behalf al menat"
52,5,11,"Therefore, give chozek"
52,5,12,"Now we ask you, Achim b'Moshiach, to have havanah"

53,2,6,"Yet you know what is restraining now, so that he [Anti-Moshiach] may be unveiled and revealed in his own time."

53,2,10,"and with all deception of resha"
53,2,11,"And for this reason Hashem sends to them a powerful madduchei shav"
53,2,12,"This is for the purpose of condemning to Onesh all the ones who have no emunah in haEmes, but instead have had delight in resha.  THE BECHIRAH OF THE BIKKURIM FOR THE GEULAH AND THE FAITHFUL SHOMRIM OF MOSHIACH'S TORAH"
53,2,13,"But we ought always to offer todot and make berachot to Hashem concerning you, Achim b'Moshiach ahuvei Hashem, because Hashem chose you as bikkurim for the Geulah through kedusha of the Ruach HaKodesh and emunah in haEmes."
53,2,14,"This is haEmes to which Hashem called you through our Besuras HaGeulah to the obtaining of the kavod of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua."
53,2,15,"So then, Achim b'Moshiach, stand fast and hold fast to the [orthodox Jewish] emunah, the Moshiach's torah that was handed over and transmitted to you, which you were taught whether by dibbur"
53,2,16,"Now may haMelech haMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu Himself and Elohim Avinu, who has regarded us with ahavah"

53,3,5,"Now may Hashem direct your levavot in the ahavat Hashem and into the zitzfleisch of Moshiach.   ADMONITION AGAINST SCHNORRERS IN THE KEHILLAH"
53,3,6,"Now we charge you, Achim b'Moshiach, b'Shem Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, to shun association with every one of the Achim b'Moshiach who follows the derech habatlanim"
53,3,7,"For you yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate us as a mofet, a role model, because we were not batlanim among you."
53,3,8,"Nor did we eat lechem"
53,3,9,"not because we do not have the zechut"
53,3,10,"For even when we were with you, this we used to direct you: that if anyone will not be a melachah"
53,3,11,"For we hear that some among you are leading the life of a batlan"
53,3,12,"Now such persons we are directing and exhort in Moshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu to work with quietness that they may eat their own lechem."
53,3,13,"But you, Achim b'Moshiach, do not lose chozek in well-doing."
53,3,14,"But if anyone does not obey the gzeira"
53,3,15,"And do not consider"

54,1,2,"To Timotiyos [Act 16:1], a true born ben baEmunah"
54,1,3,"Even as I urged you to remain in Ephesus while I was going into Macedonia so that you might enjoin the mitzva"
54,1,4,"nor to focus on aggadah [Titus 1:14] and endless toledot"
54,1,5,"But the tachlis"

54,1,7,"Wanting to be rabbonim of the Torah, they understand neither what they are talking about nor the things about which they so confidently make doctrinal assertions."
54,1,8,"But we know that the Torah is beneficial if anyone uses it according to the Torah-true manner of Moshiach's Judaism."
54,1,9,"Knowing this: that the Torah is not intended for the anshei tzedek but for the mufkarim"

54,1,15,"Trustworthy is the dvar Emes and worthy of all acceptance, that Moshiach Yehoshua came into the world to rescue chote'im, of whom I am the foremost."
54,1,16,"But because of this, I received rachamim that in me, the foremost, Moshiach Yehoshua might display all savlanut"
54,1,17,"Now to haMelech haOlamim, the One who is ein ketz"

54,2,11,"Let the isha"

54,2,15,"But womankind will be saved through her childbearing if nashim remain in emunah and ahavah and kedushah with tznius [2:9]."
54,3,1,"Trustworthy is the dvar Emes: if anyone aspires to the congregational office of Mashgiach Ruchani"
54,3,2,"It is necessary, therefore, for the congregational Mashgiach Ruchani to be without reproach, ba'al isha echat"
54,3,3,"not a shikkor"
54,3,4,"He must be a ba'al bayit who can manage his own household well, having his banim"
54,3,5,"Now if anyone does not know how to manage his own bais, how will he give oversight to the Kehillah of Hashem?"
54,3,6,"He must not be a neophyte in the emunah [of Moshiach], lest, having become a ba'al gaavah"
54,3,7,"Now it is necessary also for him to have a shem tov"

54,4,1,"Now the Ruach HaKodesh says befeirush and in no uncertain terms that in the acharit hayamim some will become meshummad"
54,4,2,"through the tzevi'ut"
54,4,3,"Such will forbid nisu'im"

54,5,4,"But if any almanah has banim or bnei banim, let the banim or bnei banim learn first to show yirat Shamayim vis a vis their own bais and to render recompense to the horim"
54,5,5,"Now the true almanah, left alone, has set her tikvah on Hashem and continues in her techinnah [2:1] and her tefillos yomam valailah."
54,5,6,"But the one living in hedoniyut"

55,1,5,"I remember your genuine emunah [in Moshiach], which dwelt first in Lois your savtah and in your em, Eunice, and I have been persuaded dwells also in you."
55,1,6,"For which cause I remind you to meorer"
55,1,7,"For Hashem did not bestow upon us a ruach of pachad"
55,1,8,"Do not, therefore, be ashamed of the edut of Adoneinu nor of me, his asir"
55,1,9,"the one having granted us Yeshu'at Eloheynu and having called us with a keri'ah kedosha"
55,1,10,"but having been manifested now through the appearing of Moshieynu Moshiach Yehoshua, who nullified death and also brought Chayyim and al-killayon"
55,1,11,"for which I was appointed a karoz"
55,1,12,"It is because of these things also that I suffer.  But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and I have been persuaded that he is able to stand shomer, guarding until haYom haHu the orthodox Jewish pikkadon"
55,1,13,"Follow the pattern of sound orthodox Jewish devarim which you heard from me, in emunah and ahavah in Moshiach Yehoshua."
55,1,14,"Guard the orthodox Jewish pikkadon entrusted to you through the Ruach Hakodesh dwelling in us."
55,1,15,"This you know: all the ones in Asia, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes, turned away from me."
55,1,16,"May Hashem grant rachamim to the bais of Onesiphorus, because often he refreshed me and he was not ashamed of my kaval"
55,1,17,"But, when he was in Rome, he diligently sought me and found me."
55,1,18,"May Adoneinu grant to him to find rachamim from Hashem in haYom haHu [1:12].  Also, in how many ways while in Ephesus he did avodas hakodesh you know very well."

55,2,2,"And what things you heard from me through edim rabbim"
55,2,3,"Take your place in suffering as a good chaiyal of Moshiach Yehoshua."
55,2,4,"No one on duty as a chaiyal is entangled with the everyday chiloni"
55,2,5,"And no participant in an athletic tacharut"
55,2,6,"It is the hard-working ikar"

55,2,8,"Remember Yehoshua the Moshiach, of the zera Dovid, and remember Moshiach's Techiyas haMesim, according to my Besuras HaGeulah,"
55,2,9,"for which I suffer as if I were an evil-doer, even to the point of the bais hasohar's bonds, but the dvar Hashem has no bonds."
55,2,10,"Therefore, I endure all things for the sake of the Bechirim"

55,2,14,"Remind them of these things, solemnly warning them in the presence of Hashem not to be engaged in disputes over devarim, which is not beneficial, but only ruins the hearers."
55,2,15,"Do your best to shtel zich"
55,2,16,"But profane chatter bereft of kedusha, avoid, for such will advance fraie"
55,2,17,"Their lashon hora will spread like gangrene, as in the case of Hymenaeus and Philetus,"

55,3,7,"always learning but never being able to come to da'as haEmes."
55,3,8,"As Jannes and Jambres opposed Moshe Rabbeinu, so also these oppose haEmes.  These men have been corrupted in their mind and are failures with respect to the emunah [of Moshiach],"

55,3,15,"and that from infancy you have known the Kitvei haKodesh, which are able to make you chocham with a view to Yeshu'at Eloheynu through emunah in Moshiach Yehoshua."
55,3,16,"The entire Kitvei haKodesh is Hashem-breathed and useful for hora'ah, for reproof, for correction, for training in tzedek,"
55,3,17,"that the ish haElohim may be proficient, having been equipped for every one of the ma'asim mitzvot."

55,4,2,"Preach the dvar Hashem, be ready in season out of season, expose, rebuke, encourage, with all long suffering and hora'ah."
55,4,3,"For there will be a time when sound charedi"
55,4,4,"And from haEmes of Hashem they will turn away their ear and to aggadah they will be turned aside."
55,4,5,"But, you, be kovesh es yitzro"

55,4,11,"Lukas alone is with me.  Get Markos and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for avodas hakodesh."
55,4,12,"Now Tychicus I sent to Ephesus."
55,4,13,"When you come, bring the cloak which I left behind in Troas with Carpus, and the megillos, especially the parchments. WATCH OUT FOR THAT MAZIK ALEXANDER"
55,4,14,"Alexander the coppersmith did much rish'ah to me; Adonoi will repay him L'ISH K'MA'ASEIHU"

55,4,16,"At my first defense, no one came to be with me, but all forsook me. May it not be counted against them."
55,4,17,"But Adoneinu stood with me, and empowered me, that through me the hachrazah"

56,1,6,"If anyone is without reproach, a ba'al isha echat"
56,1,7,"For it is necessary for the congregational Mashgiach Ruchani to be without reproach as Hashem's mefakke'ach al Bais Hashem"
56,1,8,"Rather, the Mashgiach Ruchani must be a man who practices hachnosas orchim"
56,1,9,"devoted to the faithful hattafah"
56,1,10,"For there are indeed many mitnaggedim, idle talkers and deceivers, especially the ones of the party of the Mohalim haGoyim"
56,1,11,"whose mouths it is necessary to stop, who are subverting entire mishpachot"
56,1,12,"A certain one of them, a navi of their own number, said, Cretans are always meshakkrim"

56,1,15,"All things are tahor to the tahorim; but, to the ones having been defiled and taking the side of the Apikoros, nothing is tahor, but has been made tameh, both lev and matzpun."
56,1,16,"Hashem they profess to know, but by their ma'asim they deny him, being disqualified [for the rabbanut or ministry of Moshiach] and sorrut, and, as to every one of the ma'asim tovim, unpalatably unkosher"
56,2,1,"But you, speak the things which are suitable to Moshiach's orthodox Jewish doctrine."
56,2,2,"Zekenim need to be temperate, respectable, men of seychel, being orthodox [in Moshiach] in the emunah, in ahavah, in savlanut"

56,2,12,"instructing us to deny all that is frai and not chassidus [in Moshiach] and all that is ta'avanut, and to live with seychel and tzedek Hashem and yirat Shamayim in Olam Hazeh,"
56,2,13,"awaiting the tikvah hameashsheret, the appearing of the kavod haEloheinu haGadol and Moshieynu Yehoshua the Moshiach,"

56,3,5,"not by ma'asim mitzvot in yechus which we have merited, but according to his rachamim, he granted us Yeshu'at Eloheynu through the mikveh mayim ruchani of rebirth and renewing of the Ruach Hakodesh,"
56,3,6,"which he poured out on us richly through Moshiach Yehoshua Moshieynu,"
56,3,7,"that, having been acquitted betzedek by the chesed of Hashem, we might become yoreshim"
56,3,8,"Trustworthy is the dvar Emes. I counsel you to strongly affirm the divrei torah I am handing on to you, that those who have become ma'aminim in Hashem may be shomer for ma'asim tovim. These things to bnei Adam are good, tov m'od."

58,2,18,"For, because Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach himself has endured being tested in the innuyim"

58,4,3,"For we ma'aminim enter into that menukhah, just as Hashem has said, ASHER NISHBA'TI VEAPI IM YEVO'UN EL MENUCHATI"
58,4,4,"For concerning Shabbos, the Yom HaShevi'i, Hashem has said somewhere, VAYISHBOT ELOHIM BAYOM HASHEVI'I MIKOL MELAKHTO (And He rested on the seventh day from all His work. [Bereshis 2:2]"
58,4,5,"And again in this mekor"
58,4,6,"Therefore, als"
58,4,7,"so then again Hashem sets a certain day, HAYOM"
58,4,8,"For if Yehoshua [ben Nun] had brought them to a place of menukhah, Hashem would not have spoken of another Yom after that [Tehillim 95:7]."
58,4,9,"Therefore, there remains a Shabbos menukhah for the Am Hashem."

58,4,13,"And there is not a yetzur"
58,4,14,"Therefore, als"
58,4,15,"For we do not have a Kohen Gadol who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way as we are, yet without [inborn and immemorial yetzer hara evil inclination] and chet."
58,4,16,"Therefore, let us approach with bittachon the Kisse of  Chesed, that we may receive rachamim and may find chesed for timely ezrah"
58,5,1,"For every Kohen Gadol chosen from among bnei Adam receives semicha for the avodas kodesh of Hashem, that he may offer both minchot"
58,5,2,"the Kohen Gadol is able to deal gently with the Am Ha'Aretz and Wayward, als"
58,5,3,"and therefore he is obligated to offer zevakhim not only for the averos of the Am Berit but also for his own averos."
58,5,4,"And one does not presume to take the kavod of the office of Kohen Gadol upon oneself, but one must have the bechirah"
58,5,5,"So also Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not seize kavod for himself to become a Kohen Gadol, but the One having said to him, BENI ATAH, ANI HAYOM YELIDTICHA,"
58,5,6,"says also in another passage, ATAH KOHEN L'OLAM AL DIVRATI MALKI-TZEDEK"
58,5,7,"Rebbi, Melech HaMoshiach, in the days of his earthly life, offered with a raised voice and tears both tefillos and techinnah"
58,5,8,"Although he was HaBen, Rebbi, Melech HaMoshiach learned mishma'at from his innuyim."
58,5,9,"And having been made shalem"
58,5,10,"having been designated by Hashem as Kohen Gadol AL DIVRATI MALKI-TZEDEK [Tehillim 110:4]."
58,5,11,"We have much to say about this that is difficult to make a midrash, als"
58,5,12,"For indeed by this time you ought to be morim saying shiurim, but instead you have need again to be taught the orthodox Jewish basic ikkarim"
58,5,13,"For everyone partaking of chalav is unacquainted with  HaDivrei Tzedek, for he is an olal"

58,6,1,"Therefore, let us leave behind the stam"
58,6,2,"of divrei torah on tevilot and tohorah and s'mikhat yadayim and of the Techiyas HaMesim and of Mishpat Olam."
58,6,3,"And this we shall do, im yirtzeh Hashem"
58,6,4,"For it is impossible for those who once received the Ohr Hashem, having tasted  of the matanah of Shomayim and having become Chavrusa partners of the Ruach Hakodesh,"
58,6,5,"and having tasted the dvar Hashem haTov and the nifla'ot of the Olam Habah,"
58,6,6,"and then, having fallen away, and become shmad--it is impossible to renew them again to teshuva, because they have pierced to themselves the Ben HaElohim on the Aitz haKelalat Hashem and have again held him up to contempt and open bushah."
58,6,7,"For haAdamah, which drinks the geshem"
58,6,8,"but if haAdamah is producing kotz v'dardar"
58,6,9,"However, Chaverim, even though we speak in this way, we have been convinced of better things concerning you and of things belonging to Yeshua'at Eloheinu."
58,6,10,"For Hashem is not unjust so as to forget your po'al"
58,6,11,"And we desire that each one of you show the same zerizut"
58,6,12,"that you not become atzlanit"
58,6,13,"For when Hashem gave the havtachah"
58,6,14,"saying KI BARECH AVAREKHCHA V'HARBAH ARBAH"
58,6,15,"And thus, having waited with zitzfleishch, Avraham Avinu obtained the havtachah"
58,6,16,"For bnei Adam make a shevu'ah by someone greater than themselves, and a shevu'ah given as confirmation, settles every matter decisively."
58,6,17,"Similarly, when Hashem wanted to demonstrate even more emphatically to the yoreshim of the havtachah"
58,6,18,"in order that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for Hashem to speak sheker, we may have chozek"
58,6,19,"This tikvah we have as an ogen"
58,6,20,"where Yehoshua has entered as a foroisgeier"
58,7,1,"For this MALKI-TZEDEK MELECH SHALEM KOHEN L'EL ELYON, the one having met Avraham Avinu ACHAREI SHUVO"
58,7,2,"with whom also AVRAHAM AVINU apportioned MA'ASER MIKOL (a  tithe of everything. As for his Name, it is rendered King of Tzedek"
58,7,3,"Without Av, without Em, without Yichus, having neither a techillah"
58,7,4,"Now consider how great among the Gedolim this one was to whom also Avraham Avinu gave from his booty a ma'aser"
58,7,5,"And the ones of the Bnei Levy have received the Kehunah and they have a mitzvah to collect the ma'aser"
58,7,6,"But, this man, though not tracing his descent from them, has received ma'aser from Avraham Avinu and has given a berakhah to the one having the havtachot"
58,7,7,"Now it is beyond all argument that the greater gives a berakhah to the lesser."
58,7,8,"Notice, in one case, ma'aser are received by mortal men; in the other case, ma'aser are received by one of whom we have solemn edut"
58,7,9,"One could even go so far as to say that through Avraham Avinu, even Levy, the one receiving ma'aser, has paid ma'aser,"
58,7,10,"for Levy was still in the loins of his ancestor Avraham when Malki-Tzedek met Avraham Avinu."
58,7,11,"Now if shleimut"
58,7,12,"For when there is a changing of the guard of the Kehunah, this behechrach"
58,7,13,"For the One about whom these things are said belonged to a different shevet"
58,7,14,"For it is ugeret"
58,7,15,"And it is even more evident if another Kohen arises resembling Malki-Tzedek,"
58,7,16,"one who became a kohen, not by means of a mitzvat haTorah concerning yichus, but according to the gevurah of a Chayyei Ein Sof"
58,7,17,"For of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes the solemn edut, ATAH KOHEN L'OLAM AL DIVRATI MALKI-TZEDEK"
58,7,18,"For, on the one hand, there is an abrogation of an earlier mitzvah because of its weakness and ineffectuality"
58,7,19,"(for the Torah brought nothing to shleimut"
58,7,20,"This was attested with an shevu'ah"
58,7,21,"but the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach became a kohen with a shevu'ah"
58,7,22,"According to such a shevu'ah of Hashem, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua has become the guarantee of a tov yoter HaBrit.  REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH ADONEINU, MOREINU, RABBEINU, V'KOHEN NE'EMAN LANU"
58,7,23,"Not only this, but it was the fact that the former kohanim were many in number, because mavet prevented them from continuing in the office of kehunah."
58,7,24,"But because Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach continues forever, he has the Kehunah l'netsakh"
58,7,25,"From which also he is able to completely deliver to Geulah and Yeshu'at Eloheinu the ones approaching Hashem through him, als"
58,7,26,"For such was for us indeed a bekavod"
58,7,27,"a Kohen Gadol who does not have daily need--as do the other Kohanim Gedolim--on the one hand, to offer up zevakhim for his own averos, and then to offer up zevakhim for the averos of the Am Berit.  For this Kohen Gadol offered up himself, once and for all."
58,7,28,"For the Torah of Moshe Rabbeinu appoints bnei Adam as Kohanim Gedolim, bnei Adam with frailties, but the dvar HaShevu'ah [Tehillim 110:4], which came later than the Torah of Moshe Rabbeinu, appoints HaBen [Ben HaElohim Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach] who came to shleimut"
58,8,1,"Now the main point of what is being said is this: we have such a Kohen Gadol, who has taken his seat LIMIN HASHEM"
58,8,2,"Our Kohen Gadol is mesharet baKodesh of the true Mishkan set up by Adoneinu and not any mere mortal."
58,8,3,"For every Kohen Gadol receives his semicha in order to offer both minchot and zevakhim, from which it was necessary for this Kohen Gadol to have something also which he might offer."
58,8,4,"If, therefore, he were on ha'aretz he would not be a kohen, als"
58,8,5,"however, the avodas kodesh ministry of these kohanim is service of a copy and shadow of the things in Shomayim, just as Moshe Rabbeinu was warned, when he was about to complete the Mishkan for URE'EH"
58,8,6,"But now our Kohen Gadol has attained a more fest"
58,8,7,"For if the Brit haRishonah had been without fault, it would not have been necessary to speak about a Brit haShniyah [Yirmeyah 31:30-33"
58,8,8,"For, when Hashem finds fault with them, he says, HINEH YAMIM BA'IM, NE'UM HASHEM, VKHARATI ES BEIS YISRAEL VES BEIS YEHUDAH BRIT CHADASHA"

58,8,13,"When Hashem uses the word CHADASHA he has thereby made the Brit haRishonah HaBrit HaYeshanah and a Brit thus made is near to disappearance."
58,9,1,"Now the Brit haRishonah farshteit zich"
58,9,2,"For the Mishkan was furnished, that is, hachitzon"
58,9,3,"And behind the Parokhet HaSheynit was the part of the Mishkan being called the Kodesh HaKodashim,"
58,9,4,"having a golden Mitzbe'ach of ketoret"
58,9,5,"And above the Aron HaBrit the k'ruvim of kavod overshadowing the kapporet, about which things it is not possible to speak now in praht"
58,9,6,"Now these things having been prepared, the kohanim go continually into the Mishkan, the hachitzon"
58,9,7,"But into the Kodesh HaKodashim only the Kohen Gadol goes, and only once a year, and not without dahm"
58,9,8,"By this the Ruach Hakodesh signifies that the derech into the Kodesh HaKodashim has not yet been revealed while the mishkan, the hachitzon"
58,9,9,"which is a mashal for the present time.  Accordingly both minchot and zevakhim are being offered which cannot fulfill with respect to the matzpun"
58,9,10,"als"
58,9,11,"But when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came as the Kohen Gadol of the coming tovot"
58,9,12,"not through the dahm of se'irim and of agalim but through his own dahm he entered the Kodesh HaKodashim once and for all, having secured for us the Geulah Olamim."
58,9,13,"For if the dahm of se'irim"
58,9,14,"by how much more will the dahm of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach who through the eternal Ruach Hakodesh offered himself without mum to G-d, by how much more will his dahm purify our matzpun from ma'asim metim"
58,9,15,"And for this reason Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is the melitz of a Brit Chadasha in order that those who are HaKeru'im"
58,9,16,"For where there is a brit or a tzavva'a"
58,9,17,"For a Brit, a tzavv'a"
58,9,18,"Hence the Brit HaRishonah was not cut without dahm. [Shemot 24:8]"
58,9,19,"For when every mitzva had been spoken by Moshe Rabbeinu to all the Am Berit according to the Torah, he took the dahm of se'irim and of agalim with mayim and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the sefer itself and all the people,"
58,9,20,"saying, HINEI DAHM HABRIT (This is the blood of the Covenant--Shemot 24:8 which Hashem commanded you."
58,9,21,"And in the same way he sprinked both the Mishkan and also all the k'lei haSherut"
58,9,22,"Indeed, according to the Torah, almost everything is  metohar"
58,9,23,"Therefore, it was necessary for the tavnit"
58,9,24,"For Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not enter into a Kodesh HaKodashim made by human hands, a mere tavnit"
58,9,25,"nor was it so that he may offer himsef again and again, as the Kohen Gadol enters the Kodesh HaKodashim yearly with dahm not his own;"
58,9,26,"for then it would have been necessary for him to suffer often from the hivvased tevel"
58,9,27,"And in as much as it is destined for men to die once and after this comes HaMishpat, HaDin,"
58,9,28,"so he, having been offered up once in order that HU NASA CHET RABBIM"

58,10,4,"For it is impossible for the dahm of parim"
58,10,5,"Therefore, when he comes into the Olam Hazeh, he says ZEVACH UMINCHAH LO CHAFATZTA (SACRIFICE AND OFFERING--Tehillim 40:7"
58,10,6,"OLAH V'CHATA'AH  LO SH'ALTA"
58,10,7,"AZ AMARTI HINEH VATI BIMEGILLAT SEFER KATUV ALAY"
58,10,8,"When he said above, ZEVACH and MINCHAH and OLAH and CHATA'AH you have not desired, nor have you taken pleasure in them"
58,10,9,"then he said, I have come LA'ASOT RETZONECHAH.  He takes away HaRishonah"
58,10,10,"And it is by the ratzon Hashem that we will have been set apart for kedushah through the korban of HaGuf HaRebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, once and for all."
58,10,11,"And every kohen stands daily at his avodas kodesh sherut ministering and offering again and again the same korbanot that can never take away chatta'im;"
58,10,12,"but Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, having offered up one korban for chatta'im for all time, YASHAV LIMIN HASHEM"
58,10,13,"waiting from that time onward until OYVAV"
58,10,14,"For by one korban he has perfected forever HaMekudashim"
58,10,15,"And the Ruach Hakodesh also bears solemn edut to us; for after saying,"
58,10,16,"ZOT HABERIT ASHER EKHROT with them ACHAREI HAYAMIM HAHEM, NE'UM ADONOI, NATATI ES TORATI BEKIRBAM V'AL-LIBAM EKHTAVENNAH"
58,10,17,"LA'AVONAM ULECHATTATAM LO EZKAR"
58,10,18,"Now where there is selicha"
58,10,19,"Therefore, Achim b'Moshiach, having bittachon for haSha'ar laHashem"
58,10,20,"which he opened for us as a Derech Chadasha, a Derech Chayyah, through the parokhet, that is to say, the parokhet of the basar of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. [Tehillim 16:9-10; Daniel 9:26; Yeshayah 53:5-12]"
58,10,21,"And als"
58,10,22,"let us approach and draw near to Hashem with a lev shalem, with full assurance and bittachon of emunah, our levavot having been sprinkled clean"
58,10,23,"Let us, without wavering, hold firmly to the Ani Ma'amin of the Tikveteinu"
58,10,24,"And let us consider how to meorer"
58,10,25,"and let us not turn away as shmad defectors from our noiheg daily minyan, as some are doing, let us impart chizzuk"
58,10,26,"For when we intentionally commit chet b'yad ramah [wilful sin with a high hand of defiance Bamidbar 15:30] after having received the full da'as of HaEmes, there remains no longer a korban for chattoteinu,"
58,10,27,"but only a terrible expectation of Din and Mishpat and of a blazing AISH TZARECHA TOKHLEM"
58,10,28,"Anyone who was doiche"
58,10,29,"By how much worse onesh do you think the one will be considered worthy who trampled on the Ben HaElohim and also treated as mechallel kodesh"
58,10,30,"For we have da'as of the One who said, LI NAKAM V'SHILEM (Vengeance is mine and I will repay [Devarim 32:35] and again YADIN HASHEM AMMO"
58,10,31,"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Elohim Chayyim."
58,10,32,"But have zikaron of the yamim mikedem in which, when you had received the Ohr Hashem, you endured a great tzoros, a great kristallnacht of innuyim"
58,10,33,"sometimes being publicly abused with baleidikung"
58,10,34,"For you showed Gemilut Chasadim for the Achim b'Moshiach in the beis hasohar and with simcha you accepted the pogrom-like confiscation of your property because you have da'as that you possess a better and more enduring bechorah."
58,10,35,"Do not discard, then, your bittachon which has gadol sachar."
58,10,36,"You are nitzrach"
58,10,37,"for yet a little while and Hu HaBah [Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach] YAVO LO YE'ACHER"
58,10,38,"V'TZADDIK VE'EMUNATO YICHEYEH"
58,10,39,"But we are not of those shrinking back as shmad defectors toward churban destruction, but we are of those with emunah whose neshamah is preserved in Yeshu'at Eloheinu."
58,11,1,"Now emunah is the bittachon of things for which we have tikvah.  Emunah is the conviction of things not seen."
58,11,2,"For by emunah have our Zekenim been given approval."
58,11,3,"By emunah we understand Shomayim v'ha'Aretz found their barah from the Dvar Hashem, so that not from anything visible has what we see come into being. [Tehillim 33:6]"
58,11,4,"By emunah Hevel offered to Hashem a korban that was a mincha tovah than that of Kayin.  Through this he was given approval that he was a tzaddik, Hashem bearing solemn edut"
58,11,5,"By emunah Chanoch was taken up, was translated, not to see mavet, V'EINENNU KI LAKACH OTO ELOHIM"
58,11,6,"And without emunah it is impossible to please Hashem.  For it is necessary for the one approaching Hashem to have emunah in the yikum"
58,11,7,"By emunah Noach, having been warned about the things not yet visible to the eye of flesh, and being an ish of yirat Shomayim,  built the Teva"
58,11,8,"By emunah Avraham Avinu, when he was called to go out to a place which he was about to receive as a nachalah"
58,11,9,"By emunah he made aliyah to HA'ARETZ ASHER DIBER"
58,11,10,"for Avraham Avinu was looking forward to HaIr"
58,11,11,"By emunah also Sarah, herself barren, received the ability to found a posterity, and she did so even beyond the normal age, als"
58,11,12,"therefore, also, from one man were born [Devarim 26:5] --and indeed this man was kimat"
58,11,13,"Yet all of these became niftarim"
58,11,14,"For those saying such things make it clear that they are searching for an Eretz HaAvot."
58,11,15,"And if they were remembering ha'aretz from which they made aliyah, they would have had an opportunity to make yerida"
58,11,16,"But, as it is, they aspire for something better, an Eretz HaAvot b'Shomayim; therefore, Hashem is not ashamed to be called Ehoheihem; for he prepared for them an Ir Kodesh."
58,11,17,"By emunah Avraham Avinu, when he underwent nisayon, offered up the Akedah HaYitzchak; and he who had received the Havtachot"
58,11,18,"This was Avraham Avinu, about whom it was said KI VEYITZCHAK YIKARE LECHA ZERA"
58,11,19,"Avraham Avinu considered that Hashem was able to bring about the Techiyas HaMesim, from which he also received back Yitzchak as a tifus"
58,11,20,"By emunah Yitzchak invoked berakhot with respect to future events on Ya'akov and Esav."
58,11,21,"By emunah Ya'akov, as he was dying, gave a berakhah to each of the banim of Yosef and V'YISHTAKHU YISROEL"
58,11,22,"By emunah Yosef, as he was dying, dermohn"
58,11,23,"By emunah, Moshe Rabbeinu, when he was born, was hidden SHELOSHA CHODESHIM [Shemot 2:2) because they saw he was a yeled TOV"
58,11,24,"By emunah, Moshe Rabbeinu, when he had grown, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;"
58,11,25,"chosing rather to endure redifah"
58,11,26,"For Moshe Rabbeinu considered abuse and tzoros for the sake of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach greater osher"
58,11,27,"By emunah, Moshe Rabbeinu departed from Mitzrayim"
58,11,28,"By emunah, Moshe Rabbeinu kept Pesach and the sprinkling of the dahm [on the mezuzot, Shemot 12:22), for fear that the Destroyer of the Bechorim might destroy them."
58,11,29,"By emunah, they went through the Yam Suf as through YABASHAH"
58,11,30,"By emunah, the walls of Yericho fell down, after they had been encircled for shivat yamim."
58,11,31,"By emunah, Rachav the Zonah did not perish along with the ones without mishma'at"
58,11,32,"And what more shall I say?  For the time will fail me if I tell of Gid'on, Barak, Shimshon, Yiftach, Dovid, Shmuel and the Nevi'im,"
58,11,33,"who by emunah conquered mamlechot, worked tzedek, obtained havtachot"
58,11,34,"quenched the power of aish, escaped from the edge of the cherev, out of weakness found strength, became mighty in milkhamah, put to flight tzive'ot zarim"
58,11,35,"Nashim received back their mesim restored to Chayyim; and others were tortured to death al kiddush ha-Shem, not accepting their release, in order that they might obtain a better Techiyas HaMesim;"
58,11,36,"and others underwent the nisayon of cruel mockings and scourgings, also the kaval and the beis hasohar."
58,11,37,"they were killed by seqilah"
58,11,38,"those of whom the Olam Hazeh was not worthy, wandering in deserts and mountains and caves of the earth."
58,11,39,"And all these, having Hashem's commendation through their emunah, did not receive the havtachah"
58,11,40,"Hashem having foreseen something better for us, so that, apart from us, they should not be made shelemut."
58,12,1,"So, therefore, als"
58,12,2,"fixing our gaze on the Mekhonen"
58,12,3,"Let your hitbonenut"
58,12,4,"For you have not yet resisted to the point of death al kiddush ha-Shem in your struggle against Chet;"
58,12,5,"and you have let slip from zikaron"
58,12,6,"KI ES ASHER YE'EHAV HASHEM YOKHI'ACH YAKHIV ES BEN YIRTZEH"
58,12,7,"For you endure nisayonot for the sake of Musar.  And Hashem is dealing with you as banim.  For what ben is there whom an Abba does not give musar?"
58,12,8,"But if you are without musar, in which all the yeladim share, then you are not banim but mamzerim."
58,12,9,"Furthermore, we had Avot on haAretz, who were morim that we reverenced and treated with kavod. Should we not even more subject ourselves to the Avi HaRuchot and live?"
58,12,10,"For they disciplined us for a short time, as seemed tov to them, but Hashem disciplines us for tov lanu in order that we might share in his kedusha."
58,12,11,"All musar for the moment seems not to be na'im"
58,12,12,"Therefore, CHAZZKU YADAYIM RAFOT UVIRKATIM KOSHLOT"
58,12,13,"and make the drakhim straight for your feet, so that the ever"
58,12,14,"Pursue shalom with kol bnei Adam, and the kedusha without which no one will see Hashem."
58,12,15,"See to it that no one fall short of the Chen v'Chesed Hashem; that no SHORESH"
58,12,16,"lest someone guilty of gilui arayot"
58,12,17,"For you have da'as that even afterwards, when he desired to receive the nachalah of the berakhah, he was rejected, for he found no place for teshuva, though he sought for it with tears.     DEVEKUT"
58,12,18,"For you have not come to a Har that can be touched and to a blazing Aish and to choshech and gloom and storm,"
58,12,19,"and to the blast of a shofar and the sound of dvarim, which sound was such that the ones having heard begged that no further dvar be spoken to them."
58,12,20,"For they could not bear the mitzvah If even a BEHEMAH"
58,12,21,"And so fearful was the sight that Moshe Rabbeinu said YAGORTI"
58,12,22,"but you have come to Mount Tziyon, that is, HaIr HaElohim Chayyim, to the Yerushalayim in Shomayim and to myriads of malachim in a knesset of festivity,"
58,12,23,"and to the Kehillat HaBechorim who are inscribed in Shomayim and to Hashem, the Shofet HaKol, and to the ruchot"
58,12,24,"and to Yehoshua, the Melitz of a Brit Chadasha and to the dahm hahazzayah"
58,12,25,"See to it that you do not refuse the One speaking.  For if those did not escape when they refused him who gave them warning on ha'aretz, much less shall we escape who turn away from the One whose warning comes from Shomayim."
58,12,26,"And the bat kol of Hashem shook ha'aretz then, but now he has given havtachah"
58,12,27,"Now the phrase, Yet once more denotes the removal of that which can be shaken, that is, created things, in order that the unshakeable may remain."
58,12,28,"Therefore, als"
58,12,29,"For, indeed, Eloheinu is a consuming Aish. [Devarim 4:24; 9:3; Yeshayah 33:14)"
58,13,1,"Let ahavat achim"
58,13,2,"Do not neglect hachnosas orchim"
58,13,3,"Have zikaron of the prisoners in the beis hasohar, as if having been bound with the kaval"
58,13,4,"Let the chuppah have kavod in the eyes of all, and let the Chassuna remain kadosha, for those guilty of gilui arayot"
58,13,5,"Fier zich"
58,13,6,"so that we say with bittachon, HASHEM LI my helper, LO IRA MAH YA'ASEH LI ADAM"
58,13,7,"Remember your manhigim and be machshiv and mechabed toward those who spoke to you the dvar Hashem; and considering the toitzaa"
58,13,8,"Yehoshua--Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, the same etmol, hayom, ul'Olamim."
58,13,9,"Do not be carried away by various torot zarot; for it is tov for the lev to be given chizzuk by the Chen v'Chesed Hashem, not by okhel through which those who were thus occupied were not benefitted."
58,13,10,"We have a Mitzbe'ach from which those who serve the Mishkan have no right to eat."
58,13,11,"For the zevakhim whose dahm is brought into the Kodesh HaKodashim by the Kohen Gadol as a Kapparat HaChet are burned outside the makhaneh"
58,13,12,"Therefore, Yehoshua also, that he might make the Am Berit kedoshim through his own dahm, suffered outside the sha'ar."
58,13,13,"So then, let us go out to him outside the makhaneh, bearing the reproach of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
58,13,14,"For we do not have here a lasting Ir HaKodesh, but we seek one to come."
58,13,15,"By him, therefore, let us offer up a zevach todah to Hashem continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving hodayah"
58,13,16,"But do not drift away from ma'asim tovim and sharing; for with such zevakhim Hashem is well pleased."
58,13,17,"Obey your manhigim and submit to them; for they are being shomer over your neshamot, as those who have achraius"
58,13,18,"Daven tefillos for us, for we are persuaded that we have a matzpun tahor in everything, wishing to conduct ourselves commendably in all things."
58,13,19,"And I urge you all the more to do this, that I may be restored to you more quickly.    SHIR HALLEL"
58,13,20,"Now the Elohei Hashalom, who brought up in the Techiyas HaMesim, HaRo'eh HaTzon HaGadol, through the Dahm Brit Olam, even  Adoneinu,"
58,13,21,"may he equip you with every ma'aseh tov in order to do his ratzon, working in us that which is well pleasing in his sight through Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, to whom be kavod l'Olemei Olamim. Omein."
58,13,22,"Now I urge you, Achim b'Moshiach, bear with this dvar hachizzuk, for indeed an iggeret I have written you bekitzur"
58,13,23,"Have da'as that our Ach b'Moshiach Timotiyos has been released, with whom if he comes shortly, I will see you."
58,13,24,"Shalom greetings to all your manhigim and all the kedoshim. The ones from Italy send shalom greetings to you."
58,13,25,"Chen v'Chesed Hashem be with all of you."
59,1,1,"Ya'akov, eved"
59,1,2,"Consider it all simcha, my Achim b'Moshiach, whenever you fall into various nisayonot"
59,1,3,"because you have da'as that the emunah you have, when it is tested, produces savlanut"
59,1,4,"And let savlanut be shleimah in its po'al"
59,1,5,"But if anyone of you is lacking chochmah"
59,1,6,"But let the tefillah be offered with much bittachon in emunah"
59,1,7,"Let not such a one presume that he will receive anything from Adoneinu."
59,1,8,"He is an ish"
59,1,9,"But let the Ach b'Moshiach of shiflut"
59,1,10,"And let the Ach b'Moshiach who has osher"
59,1,11,"For the shemesh"
59,1,12,"Ashrey is the one who stands up under nisayon"
59,1,13,"However, let no one say, when he is tempted, from Hashem I am being tempted, for Hashem cannot be tempted to crave ra'ah"
59,1,14,"But each one is tempted by his own ta'avah"
59,1,15,"Then after her conception Ta'avah gives birth to Averah"
59,1,16,"Do not fall under a delusion, my beloved Achim b'Moshiach."
59,1,17,"Every good endowment and every matanah shleimah"
59,1,18,"Birtzon Hashem"
59,1,19,"Have da'as of this, my beloved Achim b'Moshiach.  Let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to ka'as"
59,1,20,"For the ka'as haBnei Adam does not accomplish the Tzikat Hashem."
59,1,21,"Therefore, having put away all filthiness and what remains of resha"
59,1,22,"Now be Shomrei HaDavar Hashem and not Shomei HaDavar only, thereby causing yourselves to fall under remiyah"
59,1,23,"Because if anyone is Shomei HaDavar and not Shomrei HaDavar, this one is like a man looking at his ponum in a mirror,"
59,1,24,"for he observed himself and has gone away and immediately forgot what he looked like."
59,1,25,"But the one having peered into the Torah haShleimah, the Torah HaCherut, and there remaining entranced, not as a forgetful listener but one who is shomer mitzvot and goes into action--this one will have a beracha on his head in all his acts. [Tehillim 19:7]"
59,1,26,"If anyone considers himself to be one of the Charedim"
59,1,27,"Avodas Kodesh that is tehorah"
59,2,1,"My Achim b'Moshiach, surely you do not with your acts of maso panim"
59,2,2,"For if there enter into your Bet HaKnesset"
59,2,3,"and you pay special attention to the takif [influential man]  wearing the bekeshe and shtreimel and say, You sit here in seat of kibbud"
59,2,4,"did you not among yourselves differentiate with prejudice and became shofetim"
59,2,5,"Hinei! My beloved Achim b'Moshiach, did not Der Oybershter make the Aniyim of the Olam Hazeh in fact Bechirim of Hashem to be rich in emunah and yoreshim of the Malchut, which Adoshem gave as a havtachah"
59,2,6,"But you dishonored the ish evyon"
59,2,7,"Do they not commit Chillul Hashem blasphemies against the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach's Shem Tov that has been named upon you?"
59,2,8,"If indeed you are shomer regarding the Dat HaMalkhut"
59,2,9,"But if you show maso panim"
59,2,10,"For whoever is shomer over kol haTorah but stumbles in one mitzvah, such is condemned as ashem"
59,2,11,"For the One having said, LO TINAF"
59,2,12,"So let your dvarim be and your ma'asim as by the Torah HaCherut you are about to come under the Bet Din Mishpat."
59,2,13,"For the Din"
59,2,14,"What is the revach"
59,2,15,"If an Ach b'Moshiach or an Achot b'Moshiach is dressed in shmate"
59,2,16,"and anyone of you says to them, Go in shalom! Be warmed and fed! but you do not give to them the physical necessities, what is the revach?"
59,2,17,"So also Emunah, if alongside it there is not in its company Ma'asim, is by itself niftar."
59,2,18,"But someone will say, You have emunah and I have ma'asim. You make known to me the hitgalut haSod"
59,2,19,"So you're impressed with yourselves that with your emunah you can recite the keri'at Shema, nu?  O you do so well...why, even the shedim have your da'as and emunah! But they shudder! [Devarim 6:4]"
59,2,20,"Are you willing to have da'as, O hollow man, that Emunah unharnessed to Ma'asim, stands idle?"
59,2,21,"Avraham Avinu, was he not YITZDAK IM HASHEM"
59,2,22,"Hinei! While Avraham Avinu's Emunah was working, working right alongside was Avraham Avinu's Ma'asim, and by Ma'asim the emunah was made shleimah!"
59,2,23,"And the Kitvei Hakodesh was fulfilled, Avraham Avinu HE'EMIN BA'HASHEM VAYACHSHEVEHA LO TZDAKA"
59,2,24,"You see that from Ma'asim a man is YITZDAK IM HASHEM and not from sterilely unpartnered Emunah."
59,2,25,"And likewise also Rachav the Zonah--was she not made YITZDAK IM HASHEM from ma'asim, having received the messengers and having sent them out a different way?"
59,2,26,"For just as the guf"
59,3,1,"Not many of you, Achim b'Moshiach, should be Morim for Moshiach, als"
59,3,2,"For all of us stumble variously. If anyone as far as lashon hora is concerned, does not stumble, this one is an ish tamim able to bridle also the entire guf"
59,3,3,"And if we put bits into the mouths of susim to bring them into mishma'at"
59,3,4,"Hinei! also the oniyot"
59,3,5,"So also the lashon"
59,3,6,"And the lashon is an Aish, the lashon is made an Olam HaAvel"
59,3,7,"For every species both of wild animals and bird, reptiles and marine creatures is tamed and has been tamed by the species of bnei Adam."
59,3,8,"But the Lashon no one of bnei Adam is able to tame, an uncontrollable ra'ah"
59,3,9,"With this we say a berucha to Hashem, Adoneinu and Avoteynu, and with this we say a curse to bnei Adam, who have been created according to the demut Elohim [Bereshis 1:26,27f)."
59,3,10,"Out of the same PEH comes forth berakhah and also kelalah. My Achim b'Moshiach, these things ought not to be."
59,3,11,"Surely not out of the same makor"
59,3,12,"Surely an aitz te'enah"
59,3,13,"Who has chochmah and binah among you?  let him show  by his hitnahagut hatovah"
59,3,14,"But if bitter kina"
59,3,15,"This is not the Chochmah coming down and descending from above, but is of the Olam Hazeh, of this world and of shedim."
59,3,16,"For where kina and anochiyut are, there is tohu vavohu"
59,3,17,"But the chochmah from above is berishonah"
59,3,18,"And the p'ri haTzedek is shalom sown by the ones making shalom. [Mishle11:18; Yeshayah 32:17; Hoshea 10:12]"
59,4,1,"From where do milchamot"
59,4,2,"You lust for something and you do not have it; you kill and you envy and you are not able to obtain.  You get involved in machalokot"
59,4,3,"Or you make techinot"
59,4,4,"No'afim"
59,4,5,"Or do you think that in vain the Kitvei Hakodesh attests that Hashem yearns jealously over the Ruach Hakodesh He causes to dwell in us?"
59,4,6,"But He gives all the more Chen v'Chesed!  Therefore it says, Hashem LALETZIM HU YALITZ V'LA'ANAVIM YITEN CHEN"
59,4,7,"Submit yourselves in mishma'at"
59,4,8,"Draw near to Hashem and Hashem will draw near to you. Cleanse your yadayim"
59,4,9,"Lament and mourn and weep.  Let the sechok"
59,4,10,"Be humbled before Hashem and He will exalt you. [Iyov 5:11]  YOU ARE NOT THE SHOFET OF KOL HA'ARETZ"
59,4,11,"Do not speak lashon hora against an Ach b'Moshiach. The one speaking against an Ach b'Moshiach or setting himself up as a shofet"
59,4,12,"One is HaMechokak"
59,4,13,"Come now, you who say, Hayom"
59,4,14,"Yet you do not even have da'as of what tomorrow's yom may  bring.  Look at your kiyum"
59,4,15,"Instead of this, you ought to say Im yirtzeh Hashem"
59,4,16,"But now you boast in your pretensions. All such ravrevanut"
59,4,17,"To the one having da'as, therefore, knowing to do tov and not doing it, to him is it chet."
59,5,1,"Come now, you who have osher"
59,5,2,"The osher of you has rotted and your malbush has become moth-eaten. [Iyov 13:28; Tehillim 39:11; Yeshayah 50:9]"

62,3,8,"The one practicing averos is of Hasatan, because from the beginning Hasatan sins. For this tachlis was made hitgalut the Ben HaElohim, that he might destroy the pe'ulot Hasatan."
62,3,9,"Everyone having been born of Hashem is not practicing chet, because his Zera makes maon in him, and he cannot abide sinning, because he is born of Hashem. [Tehillim 119:3]"

62,3,11,"Because this is the divrei Torah which we heard from the Reshit, that we have ahavah one for another,"
62,3,12,"not as Kayin, who was of the evil one, and slaughtered the ach of him; and for what cause did he slaughter him?  Because the ma'asim of him were ra'im and the ma'asim of the ach of him were tzedek. [Bereshis 4:8; Tehillim 38:20; Mishle 29:10]"
62,3,13,"And, Achim b'Moshiach, do not marvel if the Olam Hazeh hates you."
62,3,14,"We have da'as that we have passed out of mavet into Chayyim, because we have ahavah for the Achim b'Moshiach; the one not having ahavah makes his ma'on in death."
62,3,15,"Everyone hating his Ach b'Moshiach is a rotzeiach"
62,3,16,"By this we have had da'as of ahavah, because that One on behalf of us laid down his neshamah; and we ought, on behalf of the Achim b'Moshiach, to lay down our neshamot."
62,3,17,"Now whoever has vital possessions of the Olam Hazeh and sees the Ach b'Moshiach of him being nitzrach"
62,3,18,"Yeladim, let us not have ahavah in dvar or in lashon  but in ma'aseh and in Emes.[Yechezkel 33:31]"
62,3,19,"And by this we will have da'as that we are of HaEmes, and before him we will persuade our levavot,"

62,3,22,"And whatever we request, we receive from him, because we are shomer of his mitzvot and the things pleasing before him we practice."
62,3,23,"And this is the mitzvah of him, that we have emunah b'Shem of the Ben HaElohim of him, Yehoshua, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and that we have ahavah one for another, as he gave mitzvah to us."
62,3,24,"And the one being shomer of his mitzvot makes his ma'on in him and he makes his ma'on in him; and by this we have da'as that he abides in us, by the Ruach Hakodesh whom he gave to us."
62,4,1,"Chaverim, do not believe every ruach. [Yirmeyah 29:8] But test the ruchot"
62,4,2,"By this we have da'as of the Ruach Hakodesh of Hashem: every ruach which makes hoda'ah"
62,4,3,"and every ruach which does not make hoda'ah of Yehoshua is not of Hashem.  And this is the ruach of the Anti-Moshiach, which you have heard that it is coming; and now it already is in the Olam Hazeh."
62,4,4,"Yeladim, you are of Hashem, and you have overcome them, because greater is the One in you than the one in the Olam Hazeh. [Melachim Bais 6:16]"
62,4,5,"They are of the Olam Hazeh; therefore, of the Olam Hazeh they speak, and the Olam Hazeh pays heed to them."
62,4,6,"We are of Hashem; the one having da'as of Hashem pays heed to us; he who is not of Hashem does not pay heed to us.  From this we have da'as of the Ruach Hakodesh of Emes and the ruach of deceiving toyus"
62,4,7,"Chaverim, let us have ahavah one for another, because ahavah is of Hashem, and everyone having ahavah has been born of Hashem and has da'as of Hashem."
62,4,8,"The one not having ahavah did not have da'as of Hashem, because Hashem is ahavah."
62,4,9,"By this was made hitgalut the ahavah of Hashem among us, because Hashem has sent his Ben Yachid into the Olam Hazeh that we may live through him."
62,4,10,"In this is ahavah, not that we have had ahavah for Hashem, but that Hashem had ahavah for us and gave his Ben HaElohim as a kapparah for chattoteynu."
62,4,11,"Chaverim, if Hashem so had ahavah for us, also we ought to have ahavah one for another."
62,4,12,"No one has ever beheld Hashem.  If we have ahavah one for another, G-d makes his ma'on in us and the Ahavas Hashem in us has been made shleimah."
62,4,13,"By this we have da'as that we have our ma'on in him and he in us, because of the Ruach Hakodesh of him he has given us."
62,4,14,"And we have beheld and we give solemn edut"
62,4,15,"Whoever makes hoda'ah"
62,4,16,"And we have had da'as and have had emunah in the ahavah which Hashem has for us. Hashem is ahavah.  The one making his ma'on in ahavah makes his ma'on in Hashem and Hashem in him."
62,4,17,"By this has the ahavah become shleimah with us, that we may have ittachon in the Yom HaMishpat, because as that One is, so we are also in the Olam Hazeh."
62,4,18,"Pachad"
62,4,19,"We have ahavah because he first had ahavah for us."
62,4,20,"If anyone says I have ahavah for Hashem and the Ach b'Moshiach he hates, he is a shakkeran"
62,4,21,"And this mitzvah we have from him that the one having ahavah for Hashem should have ahavah also for the Ach b'Moshiach of him."
62,5,1,"Everyone with emunah that Yehoshua is the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach has been born of Hashem, and everyone having ahavah for the One having given birth has also ahavah for the one having been born of him."
62,5,2,"By this we have da'as that we have ahavah for the yeladim of Hashem, when we have ahavas Hashem and we are shomer of His mitzvot."
62,5,3,"For this is the ahavas Hashem, that we are shomer of His mitzvot, and His mitzvot are not burdensome. [Devarim 30:11]"
62,5,4,"Because all that has been born of Hashem obtains nitzachon"
62,5,5,"And who is the one overcoming the Olam Hazeh except the one with emunah that Yehoshua is the Ben HaElohim? THE SOLEMN EDUT OF REBBE, MELECH HAMOSHIACH'S SHLUCHIM CONCERNING THE BEN HAELOHIM"
62,5,6,"This One is the One having come by mayim and dahm, Yehoshua, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, not by the mayim only but by the mayim and by the dahm; and the Ruach Hakodesh is the one giving solemn edut"
62,5,7,"Because there are shloshah giving solemn edut:"
62,5,8,"the Ruach Hakodesh and the mayim and the dahm, and the shloshah are for solemn edut."
62,5,9,"If the solemn edut of bnei Adam we receive, the solemn edut of Hashem is greater, because this is the edut of Hashem that he has testified concerning the Ben HaElohim of him."
62,5,10,"The one with emunah in the Ben HaElohim has the edut even the eidus"
62,5,11,"And this is the edut, that Hashem gave Chayyei Olam to us, and this Chayyim is in HaBen of him."
62,5,12,"The one having HaBen has the Chayyim; the one not having HaBen HaElohim does not have Chayyim.  THE DA'AS OF CHAYYEI OLAM"
62,5,13,"These things I wrote to you who have emunah b'shem Ha Ben Ha Elohim, that you vada may have da'as that you have Chayyei Olam. [Yochanan 20:31]"
62,5,14,"And this is the bittachon which we have with him, that if we request anything according to the ratzon Hashem, he hears us."
62,5,15,"And if we have da'as that he hears us, whatever we ask,  we have da'as that we have the requests which we asked from him. [Melachim Alef 3:12]"
62,5,16,"If anyone sees his Ach b'Moshiach sinning an averah not leading to mavet, he will ask and Hashem will give to him Chayyim, to the ones sinning a chet not leading to mavet.  There is an averah leading to mavet.  I do not say we should make request concerning that averah. [Shemot 23:21; Yirmeyah 7:16; 14:11]"
62,5,17,"Kol avon is chet, and there is chet not leading to mavet."
62,5,18,"We have da'as that everyone having been born of Hashem does not continually sin, but the One having been born of G-d"
62,5,19,"We have da'as that we are of Hashem and the whole Olam Hazeh lies under Hasatan."
62,5,20,"And we have da'as that the Ben HaElohim has come and has given us binah that we may have da'as of the One who is Omein, and we are in the One who is Omein, even in HaBen of him, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua.  This one is the true G-d and Chayyei Olam [Yirmeyah 24:7]."

66,7,10,"And they cry with a kol gadol, saying, Yeshu'at Eloheinu is of Hashem, our G-d, the One sitting on the kisseh, and of the Seh"
66,7,11,"And all the malachim stood around the kisseh and the Zekenim and the Arbah Chayyot and they fell before the kisseh on their faces and they worshiped Hashem, saying, [Tehillim 3:8]"
66,7,12,"Omein, the brakhah"
66,7,13,"And one of the Zekenim answered, saying to me, These ones, each wearing a kittel, who are they and from where did they come?"
66,7,14,"And I said to him, Adoni, you have da'as. And he said to me, These are the ones coming out of HaTzarah HaGedolah"
66,7,15,"Therefore, they are before the kisseh of Hashem and serve Him yomam valailah in His Beis Hamikdash, and the One sitting on the kisseh will pitch the tent of His Mishkan over them. [Yeshayah 4:5]"

66,8,4,"And the smoke of the ketoret ascended with the tefillos of the kedoshim out of the hand of the malach before Hashem. [Tehillim 141:2]"
66,8,5,"And the malach has taken the makhtah and filled it from the aish"
66,8,6,"And the shivat hamalachim having the shiva shofarot prepared themselves that they might sound the shofarot."
66,8,7,"And HaRishon sounded his shofar; and there came barad"
66,8,8,"And the Malach HaSheyni sounded his shofar; and as it were a great mountain with aish"
66,8,9,"And a third of the living yetzurim hayam"
66,8,10,"And the Malach HaShelishi sounded his shofar; and fell out of Shomayim a kokhav gadol blazing as a torch and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the wells of mayim, [Yeshayah 14:12]"
66,8,11,"And the name of the kokhav is said to be Wormwood, and a third of the mayim became bitter wormwood, and many of the bnei Adam died from the mayim because the mayim were made bitter. [Yirmeyah 9:15, 23:15]"
66,8,12,"And the Malach HaRevi'i sounded his shofar; and a third of the shemesh"
66,8,13,"And I saw, and I heard one nesher"
66,9,1,"And the Malach HaKhamishi sounded his shofar; and I saw a kokhav having fallen out of Shomayim to ha'aretz.  And was given to it the mafte'ach of the shaft of the Tehom"

66,9,3,"And out of the smoke came forth arbeh"
66,9,4,"And it was told them that they should not harm the grass of  ha'aretz nor any greenery nor any aitz, except the bnei Adam, all who do not have the chotam of Hashem on their foreheads."
66,9,5,"And it was given to them that they should not kill them, but that they will be tormented chamishah chadashim"
66,9,6,"And in those days bnei Adam will seek Mavet and by no means will find it.  And they will desire to die and Mavet flees from them. [Iyov 3:21; 7:15; Yirmeyah 8:3]"
66,9,7,"And the appearances of the arbeh"
66,9,8,"And they had hair that looked like the hair of an isha, and they had teeth that looked like the teeth of an aryeh, [Yoel 1:6]"
66,9,9,"and they had breastplates like iron breastplates and the sound of the wings of them was as the sound of many merkavot"
66,9,10,"And they have tails like akrabim"
66,9,11,"They have over them a melech, the malach of the Tehom"

66,9,14,"saying to the Malach Hashishi, the one having the shofar, Release the arba'at hamalachim having been bound at the great river, Euphrates. [Bereshis 15:18; Devarim 1:7; Yehoshua 1:4; Yeshayah 11:15]"
66,9,15,"And the arba'at hamalachim were released, having been prepared for the sha'ah and the yom and chodesh and shanah, that they should kill a third of bnei Adam."
66,9,16,"And the mispar"

66,9,20,"And the rest of the bnei Adam, the ones not killed by these makkot"
66,9,21,"And they did not make teshuva"
66,10,1,"And I saw another strong malach descending and coming down out of Shomayim, having been wrapped in an anan"
66,10,2,"and he had in his hand a sefer katan which had been opened and he placed his ragel hayemanit"
66,10,3,"and he cried with a kol gadol as an aryeh roars. And when he shouted, the shivat hare'amim"
66,10,4,"And when the shivat hare'amim spoke, I was about to write, and I heard a kol min haShomayim, saying, Put a chotam on [the sod, the secret of] what the shivat hare'amim have spoken, and seal it up, and do not write, [Daniel 8:26; 12:4,9]"
66,10,5,"And the malach, whom I saw having taken his stand on the yam and on ha'aretz, lifted his yad yamin to Shomayim [Devarim 32:40; Daniel 12:7]"
66,10,6,"and swore by the One who lives l'Olmei Olamim"

66,10,10,"And I took the sefer katan out of the hand of the malach and ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as devash, but, when I ate, my stomach was made bitter."
66,10,11,"And they say to me, You must speak dvarim hanevu'ah again, about amim"
66,11,1,"And a measuring rod like a staff was given to me, saying, Come and measure the Beis Hamikdash of Hashem and the Mitzbe'ach"
66,11,2,"But do not measure the outer court of the Beis Hamikdash; leave that out, and measure it not, for it was given over to the Goyim, and the Ir HaKodesh they will trample upon arba'im and shenayim chodashim. [Yechezkel 40:17,20; Daniel 7:25; 12:7]"
66,11,3,"And I will give to my Sh'ney HaEdim and they will speak  dvarim haNevu'ah one thousand two hundred and sixty days, having been clothed in sakkim"
66,11,4,"These are the two olive trees and the two menorot standing before the Adon kol ha'aretz. [Tehillim 52:8; Yirmeyah 11:16; Zecharyah 4:3,11,14]"

66,11,10,"And the ones dwelling on ha'aretz rejoice with great simcha over them and make merry and they will send matanot"
66,11,11,"And after the shloshah and a half yamim, a Ruach of Chayyim from Hashem entered into them, and they stood upon their feet, and pakhad gadol fell upon the ones seeing them. [Yechezkel 37:5,9,10,14]"
66,11,12,"And they heard a kol gadol out of Shomayim saying to them, Come up here!  And they went up into Shomayim in the anan"

66,11,16,"And the esrim v'arba'ah Zekenim sitting on their kisot before Hashem fell on their faces and worshiped Hashem,"
66,11,17,"saying, Modim Anachnu, Adonoi Eloheinu, El Shaddai, the One who is and the One who was, because you have taken your oz gadol and reigned. [Tehillim 30:12]"

66,12,6,"And the Isha fled into the wilderness, where she has there a place having been prepared by Hashem, that there she can be  nourished a thousand two hundred and sixty yamim."
66,12,7,"And there was milkhamah"
66,12,8,"But the Dragon Nachash was not strong enough nor was any  place found for them any longer in Shomayim."
66,12,9,"And the great Dragon, that Nachash Kadmon was thrown down, the one being called the Malshin"

66,12,13,"And when the Dragon Nachash saw that he was thrown to ha'aretz, he brought redifah"
66,12,14,"And two wings of the Nesher hagadol were given to the Isha, that she might fly to her place in the wilderness, where she is  nourished there for a time and times and half a time, away from the presence of the Nachash. [Shemot 19:4; Daniel 7:25; 12:7]"
66,12,15,"And the Nachash spewed after the Isha from its mouth mayim as a river, that he might make her carried away by a river."
66,12,16,"And ha'aretz aided the Isha and ha'aretz opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the Dragon Nachash spewed out of  its mouth."
66,12,17,"And the Dragon Nachash had great ka'as at the Isha and went away to make milkhamah"
66,13,1,"And I saw out of the yam a Chayyah coming up, having eser  horns and sheva heads and on the horns of it asarah"
66,13,2,"And the Chayyah which I saw was like a namer"
66,13,3,"And one of its roshim seemed to have received a mortal wound and to have been slain, and the wound causing its mavet was  healed, and kol ha'aretz marveled, following after the Chayyah."
66,13,4,"And they worshiped the Dragon Nachash, because he gave his memshalah"
66,13,5,"And a PEH [Daniel 7:8,20] was given to it saying haughty  words and Chillul Hashem gidufim"
66,13,6,"And it opened the PEH of it in Chillul Hashem gidufim"
66,13,7,"And was given to it to make milkhamah"
