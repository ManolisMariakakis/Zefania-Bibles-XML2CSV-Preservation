1,1,1,"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."
1,1,2,"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness"
1,1,3,"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
1,1,4,"And God saw the light, that"
1,1,5,"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day."
1,1,6,"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
1,1,7,"And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which"
1,1,8,"And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day."
1,1,9,"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place, and let the dry"
1,1,10,"And God called the dry"
1,1,11,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed,"
1,1,12,"And the earth brought forth grass,"
1,1,13,"And the evening and the morning were the third day."
1,1,14,"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:"
1,1,15,"And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so."
1,1,16,"And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night:"
1,1,17,"And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,"
1,1,18,"And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that"
1,1,19,"And the evening and the morning were the fourth day."
1,1,20,"And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl"
1,1,21,"And God created great sea creatures, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that"
1,1,22,"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth."
1,1,23,"And the evening and the morning were the fifth day."
1,1,24,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and the beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so."
1,1,25,"And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that"
1,1,26,"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
1,1,27,"So God created man in his"
1,1,28,"And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."
1,1,29,"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which"
1,1,30,"And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, in which"
1,1,31,"And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold,"
1,2,1,"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them."
1,2,2,"And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made."
1,2,3,"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."
1,2,4,"These"
1,2,5,"And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and"
1,2,6,"But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground."
1,2,7,"And the LORD God formed man"
1,2,8,"And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed."
1,2,9,"And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."
1,2,10,"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became into four heads."
1,2,11,"The name of the first"
1,2,12,"And the gold of that land"
1,2,13,"And the name of the second river"
1,2,14,"And the name of the third river"
1,2,15,"And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to tend it and to keep it."
1,2,16,"And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:"
1,2,17,"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt surely die."
1,2,18,"And the LORD God said,"
1,2,19,"And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought"
1,2,20,"And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowls of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him."
1,2,21,"And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place;"
1,2,22,"And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, he made a woman, and brought her to the man."
1,2,23,"And Adam said, This"
1,2,24,"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
1,2,25,"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
1,3,1,"Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?"
1,3,2,"And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:"
1,3,3,"But of the fruit of the tree which"
1,3,4,"And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die:"
1,3,5,"For God doth know that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil."
1,3,6,"And when the woman saw that the tree"
1,3,7,"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they"
1,3,8,"And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden."
1,3,9,"And the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, Where"
1,3,10,"And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I"
1,3,11,"And he said, Who told thee that thou"
1,3,12,"And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest"
1,3,13,"And the LORD God said to the woman, What"
1,3,14,"And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou"
1,3,15,"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
1,3,16,"To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire"
1,3,17,"And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed"
1,3,18,"Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;"
1,3,19,"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou shalt return to the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou"
1,3,20,"And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living."
1,3,21,"For Adam also and for his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and clothed them."
1,3,22,"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man hath become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:"
1,3,23,"Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken."
1,3,24,"So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way of the tree of life."
1,4,1,"And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD."
1,4,2,"And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground."
1,4,3,"And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD."
1,4,4,"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of its fat. And the LORD had respect to Abel and to his offering:"
1,4,5,"But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell."
1,4,6,"And the LORD said to Cain, Why art thou angry? and why is thy countenance fallen?"
1,4,7,"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And to thee"
1,4,8,"And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."
1,4,9,"And the LORD said to Cain, Where"
1,4,10,"And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth to me from the ground."
1,4,11,"And now"
1,4,12,"When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth."
1,4,13,"And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment"
1,4,14,"Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass,"
1,4,15,"And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him."
1,4,16,"And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."
1,4,17,"And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch."
1,4,18,"And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech."
1,4,19,"And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one"
1,4,20,"And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and"
1,4,21,"And his brother’s name"
1,4,22,"And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every craftsman in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain"
1,4,23,"And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man who wounded me, and a young man for hurting me."
1,4,24,"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold."
1,4,25,"And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: For God,"
1,4,26,"And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD."
1,5,1,"This"
1,5,2,"Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created."
1,5,3,"And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat"
1,5,4,"And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,5,"And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died."
1,5,6,"And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:"
1,5,7,"And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,8,"And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died."
1,5,9,"And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:"
1,5,10,"And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,11,"And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died."
1,5,12,"And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel:"
1,5,13,"And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,14,"And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died."
1,5,15,"And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:"
1,5,16,"And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,17,"And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died."
1,5,18,"And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:"
1,5,19,"And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,20,"And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died."
1,5,21,"And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:"
1,5,22,"And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,23,"And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:"
1,5,24,"And Enoch walked with God: and he"
1,5,25,"And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:"
1,5,26,"And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,27,"And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died."
1,5,28,"And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:"
1,5,29,"And he called his name Noah, saying, This"
1,5,30,"And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:"
1,5,31,"And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died."
1,5,32,"And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
1,6,1,"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,"
1,6,2,"That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they"
1,6,3,"And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also"
1,6,4,"There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore"
1,6,5,"And God saw that the wickedness of man"
1,6,6,"And the LORD repented that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart."
1,6,7,"And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for I repent that I have made them."
1,6,8,"But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD."
1,6,9,"These"
1,6,10,"And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
1,6,11,"The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence."
1,6,12,"And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth."
1,6,13,"And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth."
1,6,14,"Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch."
1,6,15,"And this"
1,6,16,"A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in its side;"
1,6,17,"And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, in which"
1,6,18,"But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee."
1,6,19,"And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every"
1,6,20,"Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every"
1,6,21,"And take thou to thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather"
1,6,22,"Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he."
1,7,1,"And the LORD said to Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation."
1,7,2,"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that"
1,7,3,"Of fowls of the air also by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth."
1,7,4,"For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from the face of the earth."
1,7,5,"And Noah did according to all that the LORD commanded him."
1,7,6,"And Noah"
1,7,7,"And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood."
1,7,8,"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that"
1,7,9,"There went in two and two to Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah."
1,7,10,"And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth."
1,7,11,"In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened."
1,7,12,"And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights."
1,7,13,"In the same day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;"
1,7,14,"They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort."
1,7,15,"And they went in to Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, in which"
1,7,16,"And they that entered, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in."
1,7,17,"And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted above the earth."
1,7,18,"And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark moved upon the face of the waters."
1,7,19,"And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that"
1,7,20,"Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered."
1,7,21,"And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:"
1,7,22,"All in whose nostrils"
1,7,23,"And every living thing was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained"
1,7,24,"And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days."
1,8,1,"And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that"
1,8,2,"The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;"
1,8,3,"And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated."
1,8,4,"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat."
1,8,5,"And the waters decreased continually till the tenth month: in the tenth"
1,8,6,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:"
1,8,7,"And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, till the waters were dried from off the earth."
1,8,8,"Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;"
1,8,9,"But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark, for the waters"
1,8,10,"And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;"
1,8,11,"And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth"
1,8,12,"And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again to him any more."
1,8,13,"And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first"
1,8,14,"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried."
1,8,15,"And God spoke to Noah, saying,"
1,8,16,"Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee."
1,8,17,"Bring forth with thee every living thing that"
1,8,18,"And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:"
1,8,19,"Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl,"
1,8,20,"And Noah built an altar to the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar."
1,8,21,"And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart"
1,8,22,"While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
1,9,1,"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth."
1,9,2,"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth"
1,9,3,"Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things."
1,9,4,"But flesh with the life of it,"
1,9,5,"And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man."
1,9,6,"Whoever sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man."
1,9,7,"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it."
1,9,8,"And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,"
1,9,9,"And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;"
1,9,10,"And with every living creature that"
1,9,11,"And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth."
1,9,12,"And God said, This"
1,9,13,"I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth."
1,9,14,"And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:"
1,9,15,"And I will remember my covenant, which"
1,9,16,"And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that"
1,9,17,"And God said to Noah, This"
1,9,18,"And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham"
1,9,19,"These three"
1,9,20,"And Noah began"
1,9,21,"And he drank of the wine, and was drunk; and he was uncovered within his tent."
1,9,22,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren outside."
1,9,23,"And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid"
1,9,24,"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him."
1,9,25,"And he said, Cursed"
1,9,26,"And he said, Blessed"
1,9,27,"God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant."
1,9,28,"And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years."
1,9,29,"And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died."
1,10,1,"Now these"
1,10,2,"The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras."
1,10,3,"And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah."
1,10,4,"And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
1,10,5,"By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations."
1,10,6,"And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan."
1,10,7,"And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan."
1,10,8,"And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth."
1,10,9,"He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: therefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD."
1,10,10,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
1,10,11,"Out of that land went forth Asshur, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,"
1,10,12,"And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same"
1,10,13,"And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,"
1,10,14,"And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim."
1,10,15,"And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,"
1,10,16,"And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,"
1,10,17,"And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,"
1,10,18,"And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites dispersed."
1,10,19,"And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, to Gaza; as thou goest, to Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even to Lasha."
1,10,20,"These"
1,10,21,"To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were"
1,10,22,"The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram."
1,10,23,"And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash."
1,10,24,"And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber."
1,10,25,"And to Eber were born two sons: the name of one"
1,10,26,"And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,"
1,10,27,"And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,"
1,10,28,"And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,"
1,10,29,"And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these"
1,10,30,"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest to Sephar a mount of the east."
1,10,31,"These"
1,10,32,"These"
1,11,1,"And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech."
1,11,2,"And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there."
1,11,3,"And they said one to another, come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar."
1,11,4,"And they said, come, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top"
1,11,5,"And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men were building."
1,11,6,"And the LORD said, Behold, the people"
1,11,7,"Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech."
1,11,8,"So the LORD scattered them abroad from there upon the face of all the earth: and they stopped building the city."
1,11,9,"Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD there confounded the language of all the earth: and from there did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth."
1,11,10,"These"
1,11,11,"And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,12,"And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:"
1,11,13,"And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,14,"And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:"
1,11,15,"And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,16,"And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:"
1,11,17,"And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,18,"And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:"
1,11,19,"And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,20,"And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:"
1,11,21,"And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,22,"And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:"
1,11,23,"And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,24,"And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:"
1,11,25,"And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,26,"And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
1,11,27,"Now these"
1,11,28,"And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees."
1,11,29,"And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife"
1,11,30,"But Sarai was barren; she"
1,11,31,"And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelt there."
1,11,32,"And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran."
1,12,1,"Now the LORD had said to Abram, Depart from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, to a land that I will show thee:"
1,12,2,"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:"
1,12,3,"And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed."
1,12,4,"So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him: and Abram"
1,12,5,"And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went to go forth into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came."
1,12,6,"And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite"
1,12,7,"And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To thy seed will I give this land: and there he built an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him."
1,12,8,"And he departed from there to a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent,"
1,12,9,"And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south."
1,12,10,"And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to dwell there; for the famine"
1,12,11,"And it came to pass, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou"
1,12,12,"Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This"
1,12,13,"Say, I pray thee, thou"
1,12,14,"And it came to pass, that, when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she"
1,12,15,"The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house."
1,12,16,"And he treated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and male donkeys, and male and female servants, and female donkeys, and camels."
1,12,17,"And the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife."
1,12,18,"And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What"
1,12,19,"Why saidst thou, She"
1,12,20,"And Pharaoh commanded"
1,13,1,"And Abram returned from Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south."
1,13,2,"And Abram"
1,13,3,"And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai;"
1,13,4,"To the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD."
1,13,5,"And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents."
1,13,6,"And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together."
1,13,7,"And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land."
1,13,8,"And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we"
1,13,9,""
1,13,10,"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it"
1,13,11,"Then Lot chose for himself all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other."
1,13,12,"Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched"
1,13,13,"But the men of Sodom"
1,13,14,"And the LORD said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:"
1,13,15,"For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever."
1,13,16,"And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth,"
1,13,17,"Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to thee."
1,13,18,"Then Abram removed"
1,14,1,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;"
1,14,2,""
1,14,3,"All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea."
1,14,4,"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled."
1,14,5,"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that"
1,14,6,"And the Horites in their mount Seir, to Elparan, which"
1,14,7,"And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which"
1,14,8,"And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same"
1,14,9,"With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five."
1,14,10,"And the vale of Siddim"
1,14,11,"And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way."
1,14,12,"And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed."
1,14,13,"And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these"
1,14,14,"And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained"
1,14,15,"And he divided his men against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them to Hobah, which"
1,14,16,"And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people."
1,14,17,"And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that"
1,14,18,"And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he"
1,14,19,"And he blessed him, and said, Blessed"
1,14,20,"And blessed be the most high God, who hath delivered thy enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all."
1,14,21,"And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself."
1,14,22,"And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,"
1,14,23,"That I will not"
1,14,24,"Except only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion."
1,15,1,"After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I"
1,15,2,"And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the heir of my house"
1,15,3,"And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is my heir."
1,15,4,"And, behold, the word of the LORD"
1,15,5,"And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if thou art able to number them: and he said to him, So shall thy seed be."
1,15,6,"And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness."
1,15,7,"And he said to him, I"
1,15,8,"And he said, Lord GOD, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?"
1,15,9,"And he said to him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a female goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
1,15,10,"And he took to him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds he did not divide."
1,15,11,"And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away."
1,15,12,"And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him."
1,15,13,"And he said to Abram, Know certainly that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land"
1,15,14,"And also that nation, which they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance."
1,15,15,"And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age."
1,15,16,"But in the fourth generation they shall come here again: for the iniquity of the Amorites"
1,15,17,"And it came to pass, that, when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces."
1,15,18,"In that same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:"
1,15,19,"The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,"
1,15,20,"And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,"
1,15,21,"And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."
1,16,1,"Now Sarai Abram’s wife bore him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name"
1,16,2,"And Sarai said to Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in to my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai."
1,16,3,"And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife."
1,16,4,"And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes."
1,16,5,"And Sarai said to Abram, My wrong"
1,16,6,"But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, thy maid"
1,16,7,"And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur."
1,16,8,"And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, from where didst thou come? and where wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai."
1,16,9,"And the angel of the LORD said to her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands."
1,16,10,"And the angel of the LORD said to her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude."
1,16,11,"And the angel of the LORD said to her, Behold, thou"
1,16,12,"And he will be a wild man; his hand"
1,16,13,"And she called the name of the LORD that spoke to her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?"
1,16,14,"Therefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold,"
1,16,15,"And Hagar bore Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name, which Hagar bore, Ishmael."
1,16,16,"And Abram"
1,17,1,"And when Abram was ninety and nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I"
1,17,2,"And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly."
1,17,3,"And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,"
1,17,4,"As for me, behold, my covenant"
1,17,5,"Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee."
1,17,6,"And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come forth from thee."
1,17,7,"And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee."
1,17,8,"And I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land in which thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God."
1,17,9,"And God said to Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations."
1,17,10,"This"
1,17,11,"And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you."
1,17,12,"And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, who"
1,17,13,"He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant."
1,17,14,"And the uncircumcised male whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant."
1,17,15,"And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah"
1,17,16,"And I will bless her, and give thee a son also by her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be"
1,17,17,"Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall"
1,17,18,"And Abraham said to God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!"
1,17,19,"And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant,"
1,17,20,"And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation."
1,17,21,"But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this set time in the next year."
1,17,22,"And he finished talking with him, and God went up from Abraham."
1,17,23,"And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him."
1,17,24,"And Abraham"
1,17,25,"And Ishmael his son"
1,17,26,"In the same day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son."
1,17,27,"And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him."
1,18,1,"And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;"
1,18,2,"And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw"
1,18,3,"And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:"
1,18,4,"Let a little water, I pray you, be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:"
1,18,5,"And I will bring a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said."
1,18,6,"And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead"
1,18,7,"And Abraham ran to the herd, and brought a calf tender and good, and gave"
1,18,8,"And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set"
1,18,9,"And they said to him, Where"
1,18,10,"And he said, I will certainly return to thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard"
1,18,11,"Now Abraham and Sarah"
1,18,12,"Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am become old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
1,18,13,"And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I certainly bear a child, who am old?"
1,18,14,"Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return to thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son."
1,18,15,"Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh."
1,18,16,"And the men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way."
1,18,17,"And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;"
1,18,18,"Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?"
1,18,19,"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do righteousness and justice; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him."
1,18,20,"And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;"
1,18,21,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know."
1,18,22,"And the men turned their faces from there, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD."
1,18,23,"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?"
1,18,24,"Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that"
1,18,25,"That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
1,18,26,"And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes."
1,18,27,"And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I who"
1,18,28,"Suppose there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for"
1,18,29,"And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Suppose there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do"
1,18,30,"And he said, O let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Suppose there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do"
1,18,31,"And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord: Suppose there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy"
1,18,32,"And he said, O let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Suppose ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy"
1,18,33,"And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had finished speaking with Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place."
1,19,1,"And there came two angels to Sodom at evening; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing"
1,19,2,"And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night."
1,19,3,"And he urged them greatly; and they turned in to him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate."
1,19,4,"But before they lay down, the men of the city,"
1,19,5,"And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where"
1,19,6,"And Lot went out at the door to them, and shut the door after him,"
1,19,7,"And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly."
1,19,8,"Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do ye to them as"
1,19,9,"And they said, Stand back. And they said"
1,19,10,"But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut the door."
1,19,11,"And they smote the men that"
1,19,12,"And the men said to Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomever thou hast in the city, bring"
1,19,13,"For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them hast become great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it."
1,19,14,"And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons in law, who married his daughters, and said, Arise, depart from this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed to his sons in law as one that mocked."
1,19,15,"And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, who are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
1,19,16,"And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful to him: and they brought him forth, and set him outside of the city."
1,19,17,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed."
1,19,18,"And Lot said to them, O, not so, my Lord:"
1,19,19,"Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown to me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil should take me, and I die:"
1,19,20,"Behold now, this city"
1,19,21,"And he said to him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for which thou hast spoken."
1,19,22,"Haste thee, escape there; for I cannot do any thing till thou hast come there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar."
1,19,23,"The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar."
1,19,24,"Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;"
1,19,25,"And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground."
1,19,26,"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
1,19,27,"And Abraham rose early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:"
1,19,28,"And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace."
1,19,29,"And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt."
1,19,30,"And Lot went up from Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters."
1,19,31,"And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father"
1,19,32,"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
1,19,33,"And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
1,19,34,"And it came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,"
1,19,35,"And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
1,19,36,"Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father."
1,19,37,"And the firstborn bore a son, and called his name Moab: the same"
1,19,38,"And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Benammi: the same"
1,20,1,"And Abraham journeyed from there toward the south country, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar."
1,20,2,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She"
1,20,3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou"
1,20,4,"But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou also slay a righteous nation?"
1,20,5,"Said he not to me, She"
1,20,6,"And God said to him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore I allowed thee not to touch her."
1,20,7,"Now therefore restore to the man"
1,20,8,"Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were greatly afraid."
1,20,9,"Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What hast thou done to us? and how have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds to me that ought not to be done."
1,20,10,"And Abimelech said to Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?"
1,20,11,"And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God"
1,20,12,"And yet indeed"
1,20,13,"And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said to her, This"
1,20,14,"And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and male and female servants, and gave"
1,20,15,"And Abimelech said, Behold, my land"
1,20,16,"And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand"
1,20,17,"So Abraham prayed to God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore"
1,20,18,"For the LORD had closed fast all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife."
1,21,1,"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken."
1,21,2,"For Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him."
1,21,3,"And Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac."
1,21,4,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him."
1,21,5,"And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born to him."
1,21,6,"And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh,"
1,21,7,"And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah shall nurse children? for I have borne"
1,21,8,"And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the day that Isaac was weaned."
1,21,9,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne to Abraham, mocking."
1,21,10,"Therefore she said to Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son,"
1,21,11,"And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son."
1,21,12,"And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said to thee, hearken to her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called."
1,21,13,"And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he"
1,21,14,"And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave"
1,21,15,"And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs."
1,21,16,"And she went, and sat her down apart from"
1,21,17,"And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he"
1,21,18,"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for I will make him a great nation."
1,21,19,"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad a drink."
1,21,20,"And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer."
1,21,21,"And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took for him a wife out of the land of Egypt."
1,21,22,"And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spoke to Abraham, saying, God"
1,21,23,"Now therefore swear to me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son:"
1,21,24,"And Abraham said, I will swear."
1,21,25,"And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away."
1,21,26,"And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet have I heard"
1,21,27,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant."
1,21,28,"And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves."
1,21,29,"And Abimelech said to Abraham, What"
1,21,30,"And he said, For"
1,21,31,"Therefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they swore both of them."
1,21,32,"Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech arose, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines."
1,21,33,"And"
1,21,34,"And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days."
1,22,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, Abraham: and he said, Behold,"
1,22,2,"And he said, Take now thy son, thy only"
1,22,3,"And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and cut up the wood for the burnt offering, and rose, and went to the place which God had told him."
1,22,4,"Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off."
1,22,5,"And Abraham said to his young men, Abide ye here with the donkey; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and return to you."
1,22,6,"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid"
1,22,7,"And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here"
1,22,8,"And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together."
1,22,9,"And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood."
1,22,10,"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son."
1,22,11,"And the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here"
1,22,12,"And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing to him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld from me thy son, thy only"
1,22,13,"And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind"
1,22,14,"And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said"
1,22,15,"And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven the second time,"
1,22,16,"And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thy only"
1,22,17,"That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which"
1,22,18,"And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice."
1,22,19,"So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba."
1,22,20,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told to Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children to thy brother Nahor;"
1,22,21,"Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,"
1,22,22,"And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
1,22,23,"And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother."
1,22,24,"And his concubine, whose name"
1,23,1,"And Sarah was an hundred and twenty and seven years old:"
1,23,2,"And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same"
1,23,3,"And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,"
1,23,4,"I"
1,23,5,"And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,"
1,23,6,"Hear us, my lord: thou"
1,23,7,"And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth."
1,23,8,"And he spoke with them, saying, If it is your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,"
1,23,9,"That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which"
1,23,10,"And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the presence of the children of Heth, of all that entered the gates of his city, saying,"
1,23,11,"Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I to thee, and the cave that"
1,23,12,"And Abraham bowed himself before the people of the land."
1,23,13,"And he spoke to Ephron in the presence of the people of the land, saying, But if thou"
1,23,14,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,"
1,23,15,"My lord, hearken to me: the land"
1,23,16,"And Abraham hearkened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the presence of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current"
1,23,17,"And the field of Ephron, which"
1,23,18,"To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that entered the gate of his city."
1,23,19,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same"
1,23,20,"And the field, and the cave that"
1,24,1,"And Abraham was old,"
1,24,2,"And Abraham said to his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:"
1,24,3,"And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:"
1,24,4,"But thou shalt go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac."
1,24,5,"And the servant said to him, It may be the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land: must I needs bring thy son again to the land from which you came?"
1,24,6,"And Abraham said to him, Beware that thou bring not my son there again."
1,24,7,"The LORD God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from there."
1,24,8,"And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son there again."
1,24,9,"And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter."
1,24,10,"And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master"
1,24,11,"And he made his camels to kneel down outside the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, the time when women go out to draw"
1,24,12,"And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, prosper me this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham."
1,24,13,"Behold, I stand"
1,24,14,"And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will water thy camels also:"
1,24,15,"And it came to pass, before he had finished speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder."
1,24,16,"And the damsel"
1,24,17,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water from thy pitcher."
1,24,18,"And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him a drink."
1,24,19,"And when she had finished giving him drink, she said, I will draw"
1,24,20,"And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw"
1,24,21,"And the man wondering at her held his peace, to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not."
1,24,22,"And it came to pass, as the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her wrists of ten"
1,24,23,"And said, Whose daughter"
1,24,24,"And she said to him, I"
1,24,25,"She said moreover to him, We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge in."
1,24,26,"And the man bowed his head, and worshipped the LORD."
1,24,27,"And he said, Blessed"
1,24,28,"And the damsel ran, and told these things to her mother’s house."
1,24,29,"And Rebekah had a brother, and his name"
1,24,30,"And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister’s wrists, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me; that he came to the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well."
1,24,31,"And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; why standest thou outside? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."
1,24,32,"And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men’s feet that"
1,24,33,"And there was set"
1,24,34,"And he said, I"
1,24,35,"And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and male and female servants, and camels, and donkeys."
1,24,36,"And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old: and to him hath he given all that he hath."
1,24,37,"And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:"
1,24,38,"But thou shalt go to my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son."
1,24,39,"And I said to my master, It may be the woman will not follow me."
1,24,40,"And he said to me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:"
1,24,41,"Then shalt thou be clear from"
1,24,42,"And I came this day to the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou dost prosper my way which I go:"
1,24,43,"Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw"
1,24,44,"And she saith to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels:"
1,24,45,"And before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well, and drew"
1,24,46,"And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her"
1,24,47,"And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter"
1,24,48,"And I bowed my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son."
1,24,49,"And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
1,24,50,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak to thee bad or good."
1,24,51,"Behold, Rebekah"
1,24,52,"And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD,"
1,24,53,"And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave"
1,24,54,"And they ate and drank, he and the men that"
1,24,55,"And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us"
1,24,56,"And he said to them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master."
1,24,57,"And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth."
1,24,58,"And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go."
1,24,59,"And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men."
1,24,60,"And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Thou"
1,24,61,"And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way."
1,24,62,"And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country."
1,24,63,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at evening: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels"
1,24,64,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she got off the camel."
1,24,65,"For she"
1,24,66,"And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done."
1,24,67,"And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s"
1,25,1,"Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name"
1,25,2,"And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah."
1,25,3,"And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim."
1,25,4,"And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these"
1,25,5,"And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac."
1,25,6,"But to the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country."
1,25,7,"And these"
1,25,8,"Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full"
1,25,9,"And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which"
1,25,10,"The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife."
1,25,11,"And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi."
1,25,12,"Now these"
1,25,13,"And these"
1,25,14,"And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,"
1,25,15,"Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:"
1,25,16,"These"
1,25,17,"And these"
1,25,18,"And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, that"
1,25,19,"And these"
1,25,20,"And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah for a wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian."
1,25,21,"And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she"
1,25,22,"And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If"
1,25,23,"And the LORD said to her, Two nations"
1,25,24,"And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,"
1,25,25,"And the first was born red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau."
1,25,26,"And after that his brother was born, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac"
1,25,27,"And the boys grew: and Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob"
1,25,28,"And Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of"
1,25,29,"And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he"
1,25,30,"And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red"
1,25,31,"And Jacob said, Sell to me this day thy birthright."
1,25,32,"And Esau said, Behold, I"
1,25,33,"And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him: and he sold his birthright to Jacob."
1,25,34,"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he ate and drank, and rose, and went his way: thus Esau despised"
1,26,1,"And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar."
1,26,2,"And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:"
1,26,3,"Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for to thee, and to thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father;"
1,26,4,"And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;"
1,26,5,"Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
1,26,6,"And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:"
1,26,7,"And the men of the place asked"
1,26,8,"And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac"
1,26,9,"And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, surely she"
1,26,10,"And Abimelech said, What"
1,26,11,"And Abimelech charged all"
1,26,12,"Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him."
1,26,13,"And the man became great, and continued, and grew until he became very great:"
1,26,14,"For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and very many servants: and the Philistines envied him."
1,26,15,"For all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth."
1,26,16,"And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we."
1,26,17,"And Isaac departed from there, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
1,26,18,"And Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them."
1,26,19,"And Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water."
1,26,20,"And the herdmen of Gerar contended with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water"
1,26,21,"And they dug another well, and contended for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah."
1,26,22,"And he departed from there, and dug another well; and for that they did not contend: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
1,26,23,"And he went up from there to Beersheba."
1,26,24,"And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I"
1,26,25,"And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants dug a well."
1,26,26,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army."
1,26,27,"And Isaac said to them, Why come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
1,26,28,"And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath between us,"
1,26,29,"That thou wilt do us no harm, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou"
1,26,30,"And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank."
1,26,31,"And they rose early in the morning, and swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace."
1,26,32,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, We have found water."
1,26,33,"And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city"
1,26,34,"And Esau was forty years old when he took for a wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:"
1,26,35,"Who were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah."
1,27,1,"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Behold,"
1,27,2,"And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:"
1,27,3,"Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me"
1,27,4,"And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring"
1,27,5,"And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt"
1,27,6,"And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,"
1,27,7,"Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death."
1,27,8,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee."
1,27,9,"Go now to the flock, and bring me from there two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:"
1,27,10,"And thou shalt bring"
1,27,11,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother"
1,27,12,"My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing."
1,27,13,"And his mother said to him, Upon me"
1,27,14,"And he went, and took, and brought"
1,27,15,"And Rebekah took the choicest raiment of her eldest son Esau, which was with her in the house, and put it upon Jacob her younger son:"
1,27,16,"And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth part of his neck:"
1,27,17,"And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob."
1,27,18,"And he came to his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here"
1,27,19,"And Jacob said to his father, I"
1,27,20,"And Isaac said to his son, How"
1,27,21,"And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou"
1,27,22,"And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice"
1,27,23,"And he knew him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him."
1,27,24,"And he said,"
1,27,25,"And he said, Bring"
1,27,26,"And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son."
1,27,27,"And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son"
1,27,28,"Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine:"
1,27,29,"Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed"
1,27,30,"And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
1,27,31,"And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me."
1,27,32,"And Isaac his father said to him, Who"
1,27,33,"And Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, Who? where"
1,27,34,"And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me,"
1,27,35,"And he said, Thy brother came deceitfully, and hath taken away thy blessing."
1,27,36,"And he said, Is he not rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me twice: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?"
1,27,37,"And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with grain and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to thee, my son?"
1,27,38,"And Esau said to his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me,"
1,27,39,"And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;"
1,27,40,"And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck."
1,27,41,"And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob."
1,27,42,"And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as concerning thee, doth comfort himself,"
1,27,43,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;"
1,27,44,"And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury shall turn away;"
1,27,45,"Till thy brother’s anger shall turn away from thee, and he shall forget"
1,27,46,"And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob shall take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these"
1,28,1,"And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
1,28,2,"Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father; and take thee a wife from there of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother."
1,28,3,"And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;"
1,28,4,"And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land in which thou art a stranger, which God gave to Abraham."
1,28,5,"And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother."
1,28,6,"When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from there; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;"
1,28,7,"And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;"
1,28,8,"And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;"
1,28,9,"Then went Esau to Ishmael, and took to the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife."
1,28,10,"And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran."
1,28,11,"And he came to a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put"
1,28,12,"And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it."
1,28,13,"And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I"
1,28,14,"And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
1,28,15,"And, behold, I"
1,28,16,"And Jacob awoke from his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew"
1,28,17,"And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful"
1,28,18,"And Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put"
1,28,19,"And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city"
1,28,20,"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,"
1,28,21,"So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:"
1,28,22,"And this stone, which I have set"
1,29,1,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east."
1,29,2,"And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there"
1,29,3,"And there were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well’s mouth in its place."
1,29,4,"And Jacob said to them, My brethren, from where"
1,29,5,"And he said to them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know"
1,29,6,"And he said to them,"
1,29,7,"And he said, Lo,"
1,29,8,"And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks are gathered together, and"
1,29,9,"And while he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep: for she kept them."
1,29,10,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother."
1,29,11,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept."
1,29,12,"And Jacob told Rachel that he"
1,29,13,"And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things."
1,29,14,"And Laban said to him, Surely thou"
1,29,15,"And Laban said to Jacob, Because thou"
1,29,16,"And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder"
1,29,17,"Leah"
1,29,18,"And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter."
1,29,19,"And Laban said,"
1,29,20,"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him"
1,29,21,"And Jacob said to Laban, Give"
1,29,22,"And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast."
1,29,23,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in to her."
1,29,24,"And Laban gave to his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid"
1,29,25,"And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it"
1,29,26,"And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn."
1,29,27,"Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years."
1,29,28,"And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter for a wife also."
1,29,29,"And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid."
1,29,30,"And he went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years."
1,29,31,"And when the LORD saw that Leah"
1,29,32,"And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me."
1,29,33,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I"
1,29,34,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Now this time will my husband love me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi."
1,29,35,"And she conceived again, and bore a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and stopped bearing."
1,30,1,"And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I die."
1,30,2,"And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said,"
1,30,3,"And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her."
1,30,4,"And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid for a wife: and Jacob went in to her."
1,30,5,"And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son."
1,30,6,"And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore she called his name Dan."
1,30,7,"And Bilhah Rachel’s maid conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son."
1,30,8,"And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali."
1,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob for a wife."
1,30,10,"And Zilpah Leah’s maid bore Jacob a son."
1,30,11,"And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad."
1,30,12,"And Zilpah Leah’s maid bore Jacob a second son."
1,30,13,"And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher."
1,30,14,"And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes."
1,30,15,"And she said to her,"
1,30,16,"And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me; for surely I have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night."
1,30,17,"And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son."
1,30,18,"And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar."
1,30,19,"And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son."
1,30,20,"And Leah said, God hath bestowed on me"
1,30,21,"And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah."
1,30,22,"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb."
1,30,23,"And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:"
1,30,24,"And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son."
1,30,25,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country."
1,30,26,"Give"
1,30,27,"And Laban said to him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes,"
1,30,28,"And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give"
1,30,29,"And he said to him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle were with me."
1,30,30,"For"
1,30,31,"And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed"
1,30,32,"I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from there all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and"
1,30,33,"So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that"
1,30,34,"And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word."
1,30,35,"And he removed that day the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had"
1,30,36,"And he set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks."
1,30,37,"And Jacob took to him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and peeled white stripes in them, and made the white appear which"
1,30,38,"And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink."
1,30,39,"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle striped, speckled, and spotted."
1,30,40,"And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban’s cattle."
1,30,41,"And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods."
1,30,42,"But when the cattle were feeble, he put"
1,30,43,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had many cattle, and female and male servants, and camels, and donkeys."
1,31,1,"And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that"
1,31,2,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it"
1,31,3,"And the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee."
1,31,4,"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field to his flock,"
1,31,5,"And said to them, I see your father’s countenance, that it"
1,31,6,"And ye know that with all my power I have served your father."
1,31,7,"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God allowed him not to hurt me."
1,31,8,"If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bore speckled: and if he said thus, The striped shall be thy hire; then all the cattle bore striped."
1,31,9,"Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given"
1,31,10,"And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle"
1,31,11,"And the angel of God spoke to me in a dream,"
1,31,12,"And he said, Lift up now thy eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle"
1,31,13,"I"
1,31,14,"And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him,"
1,31,15,"Are we not counted by him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite consumed also our money."
1,31,16,"For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that"
1,31,17,"Then Jacob arose, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;"
1,31,18,"And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gained, the cattle of his getting, which he had gained in Padanaram, to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan."
1,31,19,"And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that"
1,31,20,"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he was fleeing."
1,31,21,"So he fled with all that he had; and he arose, and passed over the river, and set his face"
1,31,22,"And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled."
1,31,23,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead."
1,31,24,"And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said to him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
1,31,25,"Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead."
1,31,26,"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives"
1,31,27,"Why didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with timbrel, and with harp?"
1,31,28,"And hast not permitted me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in"
1,31,29,"It is in the power of my hand to do you harm: but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
1,31,30,"And now,"
1,31,31,"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, It may be thou wouldest take thy daughters from me by force."
1,31,32,"With whomever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what"
1,31,33,"And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents; but he found"
1,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found"
1,31,35,"And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women"
1,31,36,"And Jacob was angry, and contended with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What"
1,31,37,"Though thou hast searched all my things, what hast thou found of all thy household things? set"
1,31,38,"These twenty years"
1,31,39,"That which was torn"
1,31,40,""
1,31,41,"Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times."
1,31,42,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst now sent me away empty. God hath seen my affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked"
1,31,43,"And Laban answered and said to Jacob,"
1,31,44,"Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee."
1,31,45,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up"
1,31,46,"And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they ate there upon the heap."
1,31,47,"And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed."
1,31,48,"And Laban said, This heap"
1,31,49,"And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another."
1,31,50,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take"
1,31,51,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold"
1,31,52,"This heap"
1,31,53,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac."
1,31,54,"Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they ate bread, and tarried all night in the mount."
1,31,55,"And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned to his place."
1,32,1,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him."
1,32,2,"And when Jacob saw them, he said, This"
1,32,3,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, the country of Edom."
1,32,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there till now:"
1,32,5,"And I have oxen, and donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight."
1,32,6,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him."
1,32,7,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that"
1,32,8,"And said, If Esau shall come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape."
1,32,9,"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who saidst to me, Return to thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:"
1,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shown to thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands."
1,32,11,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,"
1,32,12,"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude."
1,32,13,"And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;"
1,32,14,"Two hundred female goats, and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,"
1,32,15,"Thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows, and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys, and ten foals."
1,32,16,"And he delivered"
1,32,17,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose"
1,32,18,"Then thou shalt say,"
1,32,19,"And so he commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, In this manner shall ye speak to Esau, when ye find him."
1,32,20,"And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob"
1,32,21,"So the present went over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company."
1,32,22,"And he arose that night, and took his two wives, and his two female servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok."
1,32,23,"And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that which he had."
1,32,24,"And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day."
1,32,25,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him."
1,32,26,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me."
1,32,27,"And he said to him, What"
1,32,28,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed."
1,32,29,"And Jacob asked"
1,32,30,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."
1,32,31,"And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he limped upon his thigh."
1,32,32,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not"
1,33,1,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids."
1,33,2,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last"
1,33,3,"And he passed on before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, till he came near to his brother."
1,33,4,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept."
1,33,5,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who"
1,33,6,"Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves."
1,33,7,"And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves."
1,33,8,"And he said, What"
1,33,9,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep what thou hast to thyself."
1,33,10,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou hast been pleased with me."
1,33,11,"Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took"
1,33,12,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee."
1,33,13,"And he said to him, My lord knoweth that the children"
1,33,14,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on slowly, according as the cattle that go before me and the children are able to endure, until I come to my lord to Seir."
1,33,15,"And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee"
1,33,16,"So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir."
1,33,17,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built for himself an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
1,33,18,"And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which"
1,33,19,"And he bought the piece of land, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for an hundred pieces of money."
1,33,20,"And he built there an altar, and called it Elelohe–Israel."
1,34,1,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
1,34,2,"And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her."
1,34,3,"And his soul cleaved to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly to the damsel."
1,34,4,"And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel for a wife."
1,34,5,"And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they had come."
1,34,6,"And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him."
1,34,7,"And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard"
1,34,8,"And Hamor spoke with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her to him for a wife."
1,34,9,"And make ye marriages with us, give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you."
1,34,10,"And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye in it, and get you possessions in it."
1,34,11,"And Shechem said to her father and to her brethren, Let me find favour in your eyes, and what ye shall say to me I will give."
1,34,12,"Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say to me: but give me the damsel for a wife."
1,34,13,"And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:"
1,34,14,"And they said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that"
1,34,15,"But in this will we consent to you: If ye will be as we"
1,34,16,"Then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people."
1,34,17,"But if ye will not hearken to us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone."
1,34,18,"And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son."
1,34,19,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he"
1,34,20,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and spoke with the men of their city, saying,"
1,34,21,"These men"
1,34,22,"Only on this"
1,34,23,""
1,34,24,"And to Hamor and to Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city."
1,34,25,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males."
1,34,26,"And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out."
1,34,27,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister."
1,34,28,"They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their donkeys, and that which"
1,34,29,"And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives they took captive, and spoiled even all that"
1,34,30,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I"
1,34,31,"And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?"
1,35,1,"And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother."
1,35,2,"Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that"
1,35,3,"And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."
1,35,4,"And they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which"
1,35,5,"And they journeyed: and the terror of God was on the cities that"
1,35,6,"So Jacob came to Luz, which"
1,35,7,"And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared to him, when he fled from the face of his brother."
1,35,8,"But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth."
1,35,9,"And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him."
1,35,10,"And God said to him, Thy name"
1,35,11,"And God said to him, I"
1,35,12,"And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land."
1,35,13,"And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him."
1,35,14,"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,"
1,35,15,"And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel."
1,35,16,"And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour."
1,35,17,"And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said to her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also."
1,35,18,"And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin."
1,35,19,"And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which"
1,35,20,"And Jacob set a pillar on her grave: that"
1,35,21,"And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar."
1,35,22,"And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard"
1,35,23,"The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:"
1,35,24,"The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:"
1,35,25,"And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:"
1,35,26,"And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these"
1,35,27,"And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre, to the city of Arbah, which"
1,35,28,"And the days of Isaac were an hundred and eighty years."
1,35,29,"And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered to his people,"
1,36,1,"Now these"
1,36,2,"Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;"
1,36,3,"And Bashemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebajoth."
1,36,4,"And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bore Reuel;"
1,36,5,"And Aholibamah bore Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these"
1,36,6,"And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had gained in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob."
1,36,7,"For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land where they were strangers could not sustain them because of their cattle."
1,36,8,"Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau"
1,36,9,"And these"
1,36,10,"These"
1,36,11,"And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz."
1,36,12,"And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau’s son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these"
1,36,13,"And these"
1,36,14,"And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife: and she bore to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah."

1,36,34,"And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead."
1,36,35,"And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city"

1,37,1,"And Jacob dwelt in the land in which his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan."
1,37,2,"These"
1,37,3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he"
1,37,4,"And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him."
1,37,5,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told"
1,37,6,"And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:"
1,37,7,"For, behold, we"
1,37,8,"And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words."
1,37,9,"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me."
1,37,10,"And he told"
1,37,11,"And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying."
1,37,12,"And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem."
1,37,13,"And Israel said to Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed"
1,37,14,"And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem."
1,37,15,"And a certain man found him, and, behold,"
1,37,16,"And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed"
1,37,17,"And the man said, They have departed from here; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan."
1,37,18,"And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near to them, they conspired against him to slay him."
1,37,19,"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer is coming."
1,37,20,"Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams."
1,37,21,"And Reuben heard"
1,37,22,"And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood, cast him into this pit that"
1,37,23,"And it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat,"
1,37,24,"And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit"
1,37,25,"And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry"
1,37,26,"And Judah said to his brethren, What profit"
1,37,27,"Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he"
1,37,28,"Then there passed by Midianites merchants; and they drew and lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty"
1,37,29,"And Reuben returned to the pit; and, behold, Joseph"
1,37,30,"And he returned to his brethren, and said, The child"
1,37,31,"And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;"
1,37,32,"And they sent the coat of"
1,37,33,"And he knew it, and said,"
1,37,34,"And Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days."
1,37,35,"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him."
1,37,36,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s,"
1,38,1,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name"
1,38,2,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name"
1,38,3,"And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name Er."
1,38,4,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan."
1,38,5,"And she yet again conceived, and bore a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him."
1,38,6,"And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name"
1,38,7,"And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him."
1,38,8,"And Judah said to Onan, Go in to thy brother’s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother."
1,38,9,"And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother’s wife, that he wasted"
1,38,10,"And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: therefore he slew him also."
1,38,11,"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father’s house, till Shelah my son shall be grown: for he said, Lest perhaps he die also, as his brethren"
1,38,12,"And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."
1,38,13,"And it was told to Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep."
1,38,14,"And she put off from her, her widow’s garments, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which"
1,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he thought her"
1,38,16,"And he turned to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come in to thee; (for he knew not that she"
1,38,17,"And he said, I will send"
1,38,18,"And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that"
1,38,19,"And she arose, and went her way, and laid by her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood."
1,38,20,"And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive"
1,38,21,"Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where"
1,38,22,"And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said,"
1,38,23,"And Judah said, Let her take"
1,38,24,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told to Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she"
1,38,25,"When she"
1,38,26,"And Judah acknowledged"
1,38,27,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins"
1,38,28,"And it came to pass, when she travailed, that"
1,38,29,"And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth?"
1,38,30,"And afterwards came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah."
1,39,1,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down there."
1,39,2,"And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian."
1,39,3,"And his master saw that the LORD"
1,39,4,"And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all"
1,39,5,"And it came to pass from the time"
1,39,6,"And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he did not concern himself with any thing he had, except the bread which he ate. And Joseph was"
1,39,7,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me."
1,39,8,"But he refused, and said to his master’s wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what"
1,39,9,""
1,39,10,"And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not to her, to lie by her,"
1,39,11,"And it came to pass about this time, that"
1,39,12,"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and went outside."
1,39,13,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled outside,"
1,39,14,"That she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew to us to mock us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:"
1,39,15,"And it came to pass, when he heard that I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and went outside."
1,39,16,"And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home."
1,39,17,"And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought to us, came in to me to mock me:"
1,39,18,"And it came to pass, as I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled outside."
1,39,19,"And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled."
1,39,20,"And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners"
1,39,21,"But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison."
1,39,22,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that"
1,39,23,"The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing"
1,40,1,"And it came to pass after these things,"
1,40,2,"And Pharaoh was furious with two"
1,40,3,"And he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph"
1,40,4,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in custody."
1,40,5,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who"
1,40,6,"And Joseph came to them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they"
1,40,7,"And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that"
1,40,8,"And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and"
1,40,9,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine"
1,40,10,"And on the vine"
1,40,11,"And Pharaoh’s cup"
1,40,12,"And Joseph said to him, This"
1,40,13,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee to thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler."
1,40,14,"But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness to me, I pray thee, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:"
1,40,15,"For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon."
1,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also"
1,40,17,"And in the uppermost basket"
1,40,18,"And Joseph answered and said, This"
1,40,19,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee."
1,40,20,"And it came to pass the third day,"
1,40,21,"And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:"
1,40,22,"But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them."
1,40,23,"Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him."
1,41,1,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river."
1,41,2,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured cows and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow."
1,41,3,"And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the"
1,41,4,"And the ill favoured and leanfleshed cows ate up the seven well favoured and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke."
1,41,5,"And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, fat and good."
1,41,6,"And, behold, seven thin ears and parched with the east wind sprung up after them."
1,41,7,"And the seven thin ears devoured the seven fat and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold,"
1,41,8,"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all its wise men: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but"
1,41,9,"Then spoke the chief butler to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:"
1,41,10,"Pharaoh was furious with his servants, and put me in custody in the captain of the guard’s house,"
1,41,11,"And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream."
1,41,12,"And"
1,41,13,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored to my office, and him he hanged."
1,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved"
1,41,15,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and"
1,41,16,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying,"
1,41,17,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:"
1,41,18,"And, behold, there came out of the river seven cows, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:"
1,41,19,"And, behold, seven other cows came out after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:"
1,41,20,"And the lean and the ill favoured cows ate up the first seven fat cows:"
1,41,21,"And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they"
1,41,22,"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good:"
1,41,23,"And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin,"
1,41,24,"And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told"
1,41,25,"And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh"
1,41,26,"The seven good cows"
1,41,27,"And the seven thin and ill favoured cows that came up after them"
1,41,28,"This"
1,41,29,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:"
1,41,30,"And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;"
1,41,31,"And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine following; for it"
1,41,32,"And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice;"
1,41,33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt."
1,41,34,"Let Pharaoh do"
1,41,35,"And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities."
1,41,36,"And that food shall be for reserve for the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land may not perish through the famine."
1,41,37,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants."
1,41,38,"And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find"
1,41,39,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shown thee all this,"
1,41,40,"Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou."
1,41,41,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt."
1,41,42,"And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;"
1,41,43,"And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him"
1,41,44,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I"
1,41,45,"And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him for a wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went over"
1,41,46,"And Joseph"
1,41,47,"And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls."
1,41,48,"And he gathered all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which"
1,41,49,"And Joseph gathered grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he finished numbering; for"
1,41,50,"And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bore to him."
1,41,51,"And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,"
1,41,52,"And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction."
1,41,53,"And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended."
1,41,54,"And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the famine was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
1,41,55,"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he saith to you, do."
1,41,56,"And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine became severe in the land of Egypt."
1,41,57,"And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy"
1,42,1,"Now when Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?"
1,42,2,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: go down there, and buy for us from there; that we may live, and not die."
1,42,3,"And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy grain in Egypt."
1,42,4,"But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest perhaps harm shall befall him."
1,42,5,"And the sons of Israel came to buy"
1,42,6,"And Joseph"
1,42,7,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them; and he said to them, Where do you come from? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food."
1,42,8,"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him."
1,42,9,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, Ye"
1,42,10,"And they said to him, No, my lord, but to buy food have thy servants come."
1,42,11,"We"
1,42,12,"And he said to them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land have ye come."
1,42,13,"And they said, Thy servants"
1,42,14,"And Joseph said to them, That"
1,42,15,"By this ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth from here, except your youngest brother shall come here."
1,42,16,"Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether"
1,42,17,"And he put them all together into prison three days."
1,42,18,"And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live;"
1,42,19,"If ye are honest"
1,42,20,"But bring your youngest brother to me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so."
1,42,21,"And they said one to another, We"
1,42,22,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the young man; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required."
1,42,23,"And they knew not that Joseph understood"
1,42,24,"And he turned himself away from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and spoke with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes."
1,42,25,"Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with grain, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he to them."
1,42,26,"And they loaded their donkeys with the grain, and departed from there."
1,42,27,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey feed at the inn, he discovered his money; for, behold, it"
1,42,28,"And he said to his brethren, My money is restored; and, see,"
1,42,29,"And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell them; saying,"
1,42,30,"The man,"
1,42,31,"And we said to him, We"
1,42,32,"We"
1,42,33,"And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, By this shall I know that ye"
1,42,34,"And bring your youngest brother to me: then shall I know that ye"
1,42,35,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money"
1,42,36,"And Jacob their father said to them, Me have ye bereaved: Joseph"
1,42,37,"And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again."
1,42,38,"And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if harm shall befall him by the way in which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
1,43,1,"And the famine"
1,43,2,"And it came to pass, when they had consumed the grain which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food."
1,43,3,"And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man did solemnly protest to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother"
1,43,4,"If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:"
1,43,5,"But if thou wilt not send"
1,43,6,"And Israel said, Why dealt ye"
1,43,7,"And they said, The man asked us carefully concerning our state, and our kindred, saying,"
1,43,8,"And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou,"
1,43,9,"I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not to thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:"
1,43,10,"For except we had delayed, surely now we had returned this second time."
1,43,11,"And their father Israel said to them, If"
1,43,12,"And take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks, carry"
1,43,13,"Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man:"
1,43,14,"And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved"
1,43,15,"And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and arose, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph."
1,43,16,"And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring"
1,43,17,"And the man did as Joseph commanded; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house."
1,43,18,"And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for slaves, and our donkeys."
1,43,19,"And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke with him at the door of the house,"
1,43,20,"And said, O sir, we came down indeed at the first time to buy food:"
1,43,21,"And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,"
1,43,22,"And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks."
1,43,23,"And he said, Peace"
1,43,24,"And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave"
1,43,25,"And they made ready the present for Joseph’s coming at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there."
1,43,26,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which"
1,43,27,"And he asked them of"
1,43,28,"And they answered, Thy servant our father"
1,43,29,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said,"
1,43,30,"And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned toward his brother: and he sought"
1,43,31,"And he washed his face, and went out, and controlled himself, and said, Set on bread."
1,43,32,"And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, who ate with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that"
1,43,33,"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men wondered one at another."
1,43,34,"And he took"
1,44,1,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks"
1,44,2,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken."
1,44,3,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys."
1,44,4,""
1,44,5,""
1,44,6,"And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words."
1,44,7,"And they said to him, Why saith my lord these words? Far be it from us that thy servants should do according to this thing:"
1,44,8,"Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again to thee from the land of Canaan: how then should we steal from thy lord’s house silver or gold?"
1,44,9,"With whomever of thy servants it shall be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves."
1,44,10,"And he said, Now also"
1,44,11,"Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack."
1,44,12,"And he searched,"
1,44,13,"Then they tore their clothes, and loaded every man his donkey, and returned to the city."
1,44,14,"And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he"
1,44,15,"And Joseph said to them, What deed"
1,44,16,"And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we"
1,44,17,"And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go in peace to your father."
1,44,18,"Then Judah came near to him, and said, O my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thy anger burn against thy servant: for thou"
1,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?"
1,44,20,"And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him."
1,44,21,"And thou saidst to thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him."
1,44,22,"And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for"
1,44,23,"And thou saidst to thy servants, Except your youngest brother shall come down with you, ye shall see my face no more."
1,44,24,"And it came to pass when we came to thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord."
1,44,25,"And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food."
1,44,26,"And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother shall be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother shall"
1,44,27,"And thy servant my father said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two"
1,44,28,"And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:"
1,44,29,"And if ye take this also from me, and harm shall befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
1,44,30,"Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad"
1,44,31,"It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad"
1,44,32,"For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever."
1,44,33,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a slave to my lord; and let the lad return with his brethren."
1,44,34,"For how shall I return to my father, and the lad"
1,45,1,"Then Joseph could not control himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brethren."
1,45,2,"And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard."
1,45,3,"And Joseph said to his brethren, I"
1,45,4,"And Joseph said to his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I"
1,45,5,"Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me here: for God sent me before you to preserve life."
1,45,6,"For these two years"
1,45,7,"And God sent me before you to preserve for you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
1,45,8,"So now"
1,45,9,"Haste ye, and return to my father, and say to him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down to me, delay not:"
1,45,10,"And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near to me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:"
1,45,11,"And there will I nourish thee; for yet"
1,45,12,"And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that"
1,45,13,"And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father here."
1,45,14,"And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck."
1,45,15,"Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him."
1,45,16,"And the report of this was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants."
1,45,17,"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to thy brethren, This do ye; load your beasts, and go, return to the land of Canaan;"
1,45,18,"And take your father and your households, and come to me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land."
1,45,19,"Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come."
1,45,20,"Also regard not your possessions; for the good of all the land of Egypt"
1,45,21,"And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way."
1,45,22,"To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred"
1,45,23,"And to his father he sent after this"
1,45,24,"So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said to them, See that ye contend not by the way."
1,45,25,"And they went up from Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father,"
1,45,26,"And told him, saying, Joseph"
1,45,27,"And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:"
1,45,28,"And Israel said,"
1,46,1,"And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac."
1,46,2,"And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here"
1,46,3,"And he said, I"
1,46,4,"I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up"
1,46,5,"And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him."
1,46,6,"And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gained in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:"
1,46,7,"His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt."
1,46,8,"And these"
1,46,9,"And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi."
1,46,10,"And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman."
1,46,11,"And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
1,46,12,"And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul."
1,46,13,"And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron."
1,46,14,"And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel."
1,46,15,"These"
1,46,16,"And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli."
1,46,17,"And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel."
1,46,18,"These"
1,46,19,"The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin."
1,46,20,"And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bore to him."
1,46,21,"And the sons of Benjamin"
1,46,22,"These"
1,46,23,"And the sons of Dan; Hushim."
1,46,24,"And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem."
1,46,25,"These"
1,46,26,"All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls"
1,46,27,"And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt,"
1,46,28,"And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to direct his face to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen."
1,46,29,"And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself to him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while."
1,46,30,"And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou"
1,46,31,"And Joseph said to his brethren, and to his father’s house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say to him, My brethren, and my father’s house, who"
1,46,32,"And the men"
1,46,33,"And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What"
1,46,34,"That ye shall say, The occupation of thy servants hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we,"
1,47,1,"Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, have come from the land of Canaan; and, behold, they"
1,47,2,"And he took some of his brethren,"
1,47,3,"And Pharaoh said to his brethren, What"
1,47,4,"They said moreover to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine"
1,47,5,"And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren have come to thee:"
1,47,6,"The land of Egypt"
1,47,7,"And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
1,47,8,"And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How old"
1,47,9,"And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage"
1,47,10,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh."
1,47,11,"And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
1,47,12,"And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to"
1,47,13,"And"
1,47,14,"And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house."
1,47,15,"And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth."
1,47,16,"And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money hath failed."
1,47,17,"And they brought their cattle to Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread"
1,47,18,"When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:"
1,47,19,"Why shall we die before thy eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh: and give"
1,47,20,"And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh’s."
1,47,21,"And as for the people, he removed them to cities from"
1,47,22,"Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion"
1,47,23,"Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo,"
1,47,24,"And it shall come to pass in the harvest, that ye shall give the fifth"
1,47,25,"And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants."
1,47,26,"And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day,"
1,47,27,"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions in it, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly."
1,47,28,"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred and forty and seven years."
1,47,29,"And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:"
1,47,30,"But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said."
1,47,31,"And he said, Swear to me. And he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head."
1,48,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that"
1,48,2,"And"
1,48,3,"And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,"
1,48,4,"And said to me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee"
1,48,5,"And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came to thee into Egypt,"
1,48,6,"And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,"
1,48,7,"And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet"
1,48,8,"And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who"
1,48,9,"And Joseph said to his father, They"
1,48,10,"Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age,"
1,48,11,"And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shown me also thy seed."
1,48,12,"And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth."
1,48,13,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought"
1,48,14,"And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid"
1,48,15,"And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long to this day,"
1,48,16,"The Angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
1,48,17,"And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he lifted his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head."
1,48,18,"And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father: for this"
1,48,19,"And his father refused, and said, I know"
1,48,20,"And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh."
1,48,21,"And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers."
1,48,22,"Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."
1,49,1,"And Jacob called to his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you"
1,49,2,"Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken to Israel your father."
1,49,3,"Reuben, thou"
1,49,4,"Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then thou didst defile"
1,49,5,"Simeon and Levi"
1,49,6,"O my soul, come not thou into their secret; to their assembly, my honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall."
1,49,7,"Cursed"
1,49,8,"Judah, thou"

1,49,33,"And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he drew his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered to his people."
1,50,1,"And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him."
1,50,2,"And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel."
1,50,3,"And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days."
1,50,4,"And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,"
1,50,5,"My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have dug for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again."
1,50,6,"And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear."
1,50,7,"And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
1,50,8,"And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen."
1,50,9,"And there went with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company."
1,50,10,"And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which"
1,50,11,"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the threshingfloor of Atad, they said, This"
1,50,12,"And his sons did to him according as he commanded them:"
1,50,13,"For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre."
1,50,14,"And Joseph returned to Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father."
1,50,15,"And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will perhaps hate us, and will certainly repay us all the evil which we did to him."
1,50,16,"And they sent a messenger to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before he died, saying,"
1,50,17,"So shall ye say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did to thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him."
1,50,18,"And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we"
1,50,19,"And Joseph said to them, Fear not: for"
1,50,20,"But as for you, ye thought evil against me;"
1,50,21,"Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them."
1,50,22,"And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years."
1,50,23,"And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third"
1,50,24,"And Joseph said to his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
1,50,25,"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from here."
1,50,26,"So Joseph died,"
2,1,1,"Now these"
2,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,"
2,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,"
2,1,4,"Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher."
2,1,5,"And all the souls that descended from Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt"
2,1,6,"And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation."
2,1,7,"And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and became exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them."
2,1,8,"Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph."
2,1,9,"And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel"
2,1,10,"Come, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it shall come to pass, that, when war happeneth, they will join with our enemies, and fight against us, and depart from the land."
2,1,11,"Therefore they set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses."
2,1,12,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel."
2,1,13,"And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:"
2,1,14,"And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, in which they made them serve,"
2,1,15,"And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of one"
2,1,16,"And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see"
2,1,17,"But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the males alive."
2,1,18,"And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the males alive?"
2,1,19,"And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women"
2,1,20,"Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and became very mighty."
2,1,21,"And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he gave them families."
2,1,22,"And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive."
2,2,1,"And there went a man of the house of Levi, and married a daughter of Levi."
2,2,2,"And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he"
2,2,3,"And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child in it; and she laid"
2,2,4,"And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him."
2,2,5,"And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash"
2,2,6,"And when she had opened"
2,2,7,"Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?"
2,2,8,"And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother."
2,2,9,"And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give"
2,2,10,"And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water."
2,2,11,"And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren."
2,2,12,"And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that"
2,2,13,"And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why smitest thou thy companion?"
2,2,14,"And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known."
2,2,15,"Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well."
2,2,16,"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew"
2,2,17,"And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock."
2,2,18,"And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How"
2,2,19,"And they said, An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and also drew"
2,2,20,"And he said to his daughters, And where"
2,2,21,"And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter."
2,2,22,"And she bore"
2,2,23,"And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God by reason of the bondage."
2,2,24,"And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob."
2,2,25,"And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God took notice of"
2,3,1,"Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God,"
2,3,2,"And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush"
2,3,3,"And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."
2,3,4,"And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here"
2,3,5,"And he said, Come not near here: put off thy shoes from thy feet, for the place on which thou standest"
2,3,6,"Moreover he said, I"
2,3,7,"And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who"
2,3,8,"And I am come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good land and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites."
2,3,9,"Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come to me: and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them."
2,3,10,"Come now therefore, and I will send thee to Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt."
2,3,11,"And Moses said to God, Who"
2,3,12,"And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this"
2,3,13,"And Moses said to God, Behold,"
2,3,14,"And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me to you."
2,3,15,"And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me to you: this"
2,3,16,"Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and"
2,3,17,"And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey."
2,3,18,"And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and ye shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God."
2,3,19,"And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand."
2,3,20,"And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst: and after that he will let you go."
2,3,21,"And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:"
2,3,22,"But every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that dwelleth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put"
2,4,1,"And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken to my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared to thee."
2,4,2,"And the LORD said to him, What"
2,4,3,"And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it."
2,4,4,"And the LORD said to Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:"
2,4,5,"That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee."
2,4,6,"And the LORD said furthermore to him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand"
2,4,7,"And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and drew it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his"
2,4,8,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign."
2,4,9,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken to thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour"
2,4,10,"And Moses said to the LORD, O my Lord, I"
2,4,11,"And the LORD said to him, Who hath made man’s mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?"
2,4,12,"Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say."
2,4,13,"And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand"
2,4,14,"And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,"
2,4,15,"And thou shalt speak to him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do."
2,4,16,"And he shall speak for thee to the people: and he shall be,"
2,4,17,"And thou shalt take this rod in thy hand, with which thou shalt perform signs."
2,4,18,"And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my brethren who"
2,4,19,"And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead who sought thy life."
2,4,20,"And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand."
2,4,21,"And the LORD said to Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou perform all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thy hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go."
2,4,22,"And thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel"
2,4,23,"And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou shalt refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son,"
2,4,24,"And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him."
2,4,25,"Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast"
2,4,26,"So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband"
2,4,27,"And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him."
2,4,28,"And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him."
2,4,29,"And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:"
2,4,30,"And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and performed the signs in the sight of the people."
2,4,31,"And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped."
2,5,1,"And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness."
2,5,2,"And Pharaoh said, Who"
2,5,3,"And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice to the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword."
2,5,4,"And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? go to your burdens."
2,5,5,"And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now"
2,5,6,"And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,"
2,5,7,"Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as before: let them go and gather straw for themselves."
2,5,8,"And the number of the bricks, which they made before, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish"
2,5,9,"Let more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour in it; and let them not regard vain words."
2,5,10,"And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw."
2,5,11,"Go ye, get for yourselves straw where ye can find it: yet not any of your work shall be diminished."
2,5,12,"So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw."
2,5,13,"And the taskmasters hastened"
2,5,14,"And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten,"
2,5,15,"Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why dealest thou thus with thy servants?"
2,5,16,"There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants"
2,5,17,"But he said, Ye"
2,5,18,"Go therefore now,"
2,5,19,"And the officers of the children of Israel saw"
2,5,20,"And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:"
2,5,21,"And they said to them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made us odious in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hands to slay us."
2,5,22,"And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Lord, why hast thou"
2,5,23,"For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all."
2,6,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them from his land."
2,6,2,"And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I"
2,6,3,"And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by"
2,6,4,"And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers."
2,6,5,"And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant."
2,6,6,"Therefore say to the children of Israel, I"
2,6,7,"And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I"
2,6,8,"And I will bring you into the land, concerning which I swore to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for an heritage: I"
2,6,9,"And Moses spoke so to the children of Israel: but they hearkened not to Moses by reason of anguish of spirit, and cruel bondage."
2,6,10,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
2,6,11,"Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel depart from his land."
2,6,12,"And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who"
2,6,13,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt."
2,6,14,"These"
2,6,15,"And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these"
2,6,16,"And these"
2,6,17,"The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families."
2,6,18,"And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath"
2,6,19,"And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these"
2,6,20,"And Amram took him Jochebed his father’s sister for a wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram"
2,6,21,"And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri."
2,6,22,"And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri."
2,6,23,"And Aaron took Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, for a wife; and she bore him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
2,6,24,"And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these"
2,6,25,"And Eleazar Aaron’s son took"
2,6,26,"These"
2,6,27,"These"
2,6,28,"And it came to pass on the day"
2,6,29,"That the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, I"
2,6,30,"And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I"
2,7,1,"And the LORD said to Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet."
2,7,2,"Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land."
2,7,3,"And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt."
2,7,4,"But Pharaoh shall not hearken to you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments."
2,7,5,"And the Egyptians shall know that I"
2,7,6,"And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they."
2,7,7,"And Moses"
2,7,8,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
2,7,9,"When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then thou shalt say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast"
2,7,10,"And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent."
2,7,11,"Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments."
2,7,12,"For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods."
2,7,13,"And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had said."
2,7,14,"And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh’s heart"
2,7,15,"Go to Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out to the water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand."
2,7,16,"And thou shalt say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me to thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, until now thou wouldest not hear."
2,7,17,"Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I"
2,7,18,"And the fish that"
2,7,19,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and"
2,7,20,"And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that"
2,7,21,"And the fish that"
2,7,22,"And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken to them; as the LORD had said."
2,7,23,"And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also."
2,7,24,"And all the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river."
2,7,25,"And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river."
2,8,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me."
2,8,2,"And if thou shalt refuse to let"
2,8,3,"And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:"
2,8,4,"And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants."
2,8,5,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt."
2,8,6,"And Aaron stretched his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt."
2,8,7,"And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt."
2,8,8,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to the LORD."
2,8,9,"And Moses said to Pharaoh, Command me: when shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses,"
2,8,10,"And he said, To morrow. And he said,"
2,8,11,"And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only."
2,8,12,"And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried to the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh."
2,8,13,"And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields."
2,8,14,"And they gathered them together in heaps: and the land stank."
2,8,15,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not to them; as the LORD had said."
2,8,16,"And the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt."
2,8,17,"And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt."
2,8,18,"And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast."
2,8,19,"Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This"
2,8,20,"And the LORD said to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me."
2,8,21,"Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms"
2,8,22,"And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms"
2,8,23,"And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be."
2,8,24,"And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm"
2,8,25,"And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land."
2,8,26,"And Moses said, It is not proper so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?"
2,8,27,"We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us."
2,8,28,"And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat for me."
2,8,29,"And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms"
2,8,30,"And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD."
2,8,31,"And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms"
2,8,32,"And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go."
2,9,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me."
2,9,2,"For if thou shalt refuse to let"
2,9,3,"Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which"
2,9,4,"And the LORD shall make a difference between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all"
2,9,5,"And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land."
2,9,6,"And the LORD did that thing on the next day, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one."
2,9,7,"And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go."
2,9,8,"And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh."
2,9,9,"And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth"
2,9,10,"And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth"
2,9,11,"And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians."
2,9,12,"And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had spoken to Moses."
2,9,13,"And the LORD said to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me."
2,9,14,"For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that"
2,9,15,"For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth."
2,9,16,"And in very deed for this"
2,9,17,"As yet dost thou exalt thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?"
2,9,18,"Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now."
2,9,19,"Send therefore now,"
2,9,20,"He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:"
2,9,21,"And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field."
2,9,22,"And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt."
2,9,23,"And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt."
2,9,24,"So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there had been none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation."
2,9,25,"And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that"
2,9,26,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel"
2,9,27,"And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: the LORD"
2,9,28,"Entreat the LORD (for"
2,9,29,"And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the LORD;"
2,9,30,"But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God."
2,9,31,"And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley"
2,9,32,"But the wheat and the rye were not smitten: for they"
2,9,33,"And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth."
2,9,34,"And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants."
2,9,35,"And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses."
2,10,1,"And the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might show these my signs before him:"
2,10,2,"And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I"
2,10,3,"And Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me."
2,10,4,"Else, if thou shalt refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy land:"
2,10,5,"And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the rest of that which hath escaped, which remaineth to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:"
2,10,6,"And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth to this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh."
2,10,7,"And Pharaoh’s servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?"
2,10,8,"And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go, serve the LORD your God:"
2,10,9,"And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we"
2,10,10,"And he said to them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look"
2,10,11,"Not so: go now ye"
2,10,12,"And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land,"
2,10,13,"And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all"
2,10,14,"And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the land of Egypt: very grievous"
2,10,15,"For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing on the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt."
2,10,16,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you."
2,10,17,"Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only."
2,10,18,"And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD."
2,10,19,"And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the land of Egypt."
2,10,20,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go."
2,10,21,"And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness"
2,10,22,"And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:"
2,10,23,"They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings."
2,10,24,"And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be left behind: let your little ones also go with you."
2,10,25,"And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God."
2,10,26,"Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for of them must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come there."
2,10,27,"But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go."
2,10,28,"And Pharaoh said to him, Depart from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in"
2,10,29,"And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more."
2,11,1,"And the LORD said to Moses, Yet will I bring one plague"
2,11,2,"Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man ask of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold."
2,11,3,"And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses"
2,11,4,"And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:"
2,11,5,"And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even to the firstborn of the maidservant that"
2,11,6,"And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it any more."
2,11,7,"But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel."
2,11,8,"And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Depart thou, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will depart. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger."
2,11,9,"And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken to you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."
2,11,10,"And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel depart from his land."
2,12,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,"
2,12,2,"This month"
2,12,3,"Speak ye to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth"
2,12,4,"And if the household shall be too small for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next to his house take"
2,12,5,"Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take"
2,12,6,"And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening."
2,12,7,"And they shall take of the blood, and strike"
2,12,8,"And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and unleavened bread;"
2,12,9,"Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted"
2,12,10,"And ye shall let nothing of it remain till the morning; and that which remaineth of it till the morning ye shall burn with fire."
2,12,11,"And thus shall ye eat it;"
2,12,12,"For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I"
2,12,13,"And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye"
2,12,14,"And this day shall be to you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever."
2,12,15,"Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whoever eateth leavened bread from the first day till the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel."
2,12,16,"And in the first day"
2,12,17,"And ye shall observe"
2,12,18,"In the first"
2,12,19,"Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he shall be a stranger, or born in the land."
2,12,20,"Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread."
2,12,21,"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out and take for yourselves a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover."
2,12,22,"And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip"
2,12,23,"For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not permit the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite"
2,12,24,"And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever."
2,12,25,"And it shall come to pass, when ye shall have come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service."
2,12,26,"And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to you, What mean you by this service?"
2,12,27,"That ye shall say, It"
2,12,28,"And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they."
2,12,29,"And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive that"
2,12,30,"And Pharaoh rose in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for"
2,12,31,"And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Arise,"
2,12,32,"Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also."
2,12,33,"And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We"
2,12,34,"And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders."
2,12,35,"And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:"
2,12,36,"And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they gave to them"
2,12,37,"And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot"
2,12,38,"And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds,"
2,12,39,"And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought from Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were driven from Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any food."
2,12,40,"Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt,"
2,12,41,"And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD departed from the land of Egypt."
2,12,42,"It"
2,12,43,"And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, This"
2,12,44,"But every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat of it."
2,12,45,"A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat of it."
2,12,46,"In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry any of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone of it."
2,12,47,"All the congregation of Israel shall keep it."
2,12,48,"And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat of it."
2,12,49,"One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and to the stranger that sojourneth among you."
2,12,50,"Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they."
2,12,51,"And it came to pass the same day,"
2,13,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
2,13,2,"Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever openeth the womb among the children of Israel,"
2,13,3,"And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, when ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this"
2,13,4,"This day in the month Abib, ye came out."
2,13,5,"And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month."
2,13,6,"Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day"
2,13,7,"Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters."
2,13,8,"And thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying,"
2,13,9,"And it shall be for a sign to thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thy eyes, that the LORD’S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt."
2,13,10,"Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year."
2,13,11,"And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it to thee,"
2,13,12,"That thou shall set apart to the LORD all that openeth the womb, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males"
2,13,13,"And every firstling of a donkey thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem."
2,13,14,"And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What"
2,13,15,"And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beasts: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the womb, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem."
2,13,16,"And it shall be for a token upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thy eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt."
2,13,17,"And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not"
2,13,18,"But God led the people about,"
2,13,19,"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had solemnly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones from here with you."
2,13,20,"And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness."
2,13,21,"And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them in the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:"
2,13,22,"He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night,"
2,14,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
2,14,2,"Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea."
2,14,3,"For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They"
2,14,4,"And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, that he shall follow them; and I will be honoured over Pharaoh, and over all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I"
2,14,5,"And it was told to the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"
2,14,6,"And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:"
2,14,7,"And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them."
2,14,8,"And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand."
2,14,9,"But the Egyptians pursued them, all the horses"
2,14,10,"And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were greatly afraid: and the children of Israel cried to the LORD."
2,14,11,"And they said to Moses, Because"
2,14,12,""
2,14,13,"And Moses said to the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever."
2,14,14,"The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace."
2,14,15,"And the LORD said to Moses, Why criest thou to me? speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward:"
2,14,16,"But lift thou thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry"
2,14,17,"And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour over Pharaoh, and over all his host, over his chariots, and over his horsemen."
2,14,18,"And the Egyptians shall know that I"
2,14,19,"And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:"
2,14,20,"And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness"
2,14,21,"And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go"
2,14,22,"And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry"
2,14,23,"And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea,"
2,14,24,"And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked to the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,"
2,14,25,"And took off their chariot wheels, that they drove them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians."
2,14,26,"And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen."
2,14,27,"And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea."
2,14,28,"And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen,"
2,14,29,"But the children of Israel walked upon dry"
2,14,30,"Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore."
2,14,31,"And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses."
2,15,1,"Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea."
2,15,2,"The LORD"
2,15,3,"The LORD"
2,15,4,"Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea."
2,15,5,"The depths have covered them: they sank to the bottom as a stone."
2,15,6,"Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy."
2,15,7,"And in the greatness of thy excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath,"
2,15,8,"And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap,"
2,15,9,"The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them."
2,15,10,"Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters."
2,15,11,"Who"
2,15,12,"Thou didst stretch out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them."
2,15,13,"Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people"
2,15,14,"The people shall hear,"
2,15,15,"Then the chiefs of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away."
2,15,16,"Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thy arm they shall be"
2,15,17,"Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance,"
2,15,18,"The LORD shall reign for ever and ever."
2,15,19,"For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry"
2,15,20,"And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances."
2,15,21,"And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea."
2,15,22,"So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water."
2,15,23,"And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they"
2,15,24,"And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?"
2,15,25,"And he cried to the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree,"
2,15,26,"And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I"
2,15,27,"And they came to Elim, where"
2,16,1,"And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which"
2,16,2,"And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:"
2,16,3,"And the children of Israel said to them, O that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots,"
2,16,4,"Then said the LORD to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law, or not."
2,16,5,"And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare"
2,16,6,"And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, At evening, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:"
2,16,7,"And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what"
2,16,8,"And Moses said,"
2,16,9,"And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings."
2,16,10,"And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud."
2,16,11,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
2,16,12,"I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak to them, saying, At evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I"
2,16,13,"And it came to pass, that at evening the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay around the host."
2,16,14,"And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness"
2,16,15,"And when the children of Israel saw"
2,16,16,"This"
2,16,17,"And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less."
2,16,18,"And when they measured"
2,16,19,"And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning."
2,16,20,"However they hearkened not to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was angry with them."
2,16,21,"And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun became hot, it melted."
2,16,22,"And it came to pass,"
2,16,23,"And he said to them, This"
2,16,24,"And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses ordered: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm in it."
2,16,25,"And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day"
2,16,26,"Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day,"
2,16,27,"And it came to pass,"
2,16,28,"And the LORD said to Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?"
2,16,29,"See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day."
2,16,30,"So the people rested on the seventh day."
2,16,31,"And the house of Israel called its name Manna: and it"
2,16,32,"And Moses said, This"
2,16,33,"And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna in it, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations."
2,16,34,"As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept."
2,16,35,"And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they ate manna, until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan."
2,16,36,"Now an omer"
2,17,1,"And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and encamped in Rephidim: and"
2,17,2,"Therefore the people contended with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why chide you with me? why do ye tempt the LORD?"
2,17,3,"And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why"
2,17,4,"And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? they are almost ready to stone me."
2,17,5,"And the LORD said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, with which thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go."
2,17,6,"Behold, I will stand before thee there on the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and water shall come out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel."
2,17,7,"And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?"
2,17,8,"Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim."
2,17,9,"And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand."
2,17,10,"So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill."
2,17,11,"And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed."
2,17,12,"But Moses’ hands"
2,17,13,"And Joshua overcame Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword."
2,17,14,"And the LORD said to Moses, Write this"
2,17,15,"And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:"
2,17,16,"For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn"
2,18,1,"When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people,"
2,18,2,"Then Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her back,"
2,18,3,"And her two sons; of which the name of the one"
2,18,4,"And the name of the other"
2,18,5,"And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:"
2,18,6,"And he said to Moses, I thy father in law Jethro have come to thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her."
2,18,7,"And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of"
2,18,8,"And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake,"
2,18,9,"And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians."
2,18,10,"And Jethro said, Blessed"
2,18,11,"Now I know that the LORD"
2,18,12,"And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father in law before God."
2,18,13,"And it came to pass on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening."
2,18,14,"And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What"
2,18,15,"And Moses said to his father in law, Because the people come to me to enquire of God:"
2,18,16,"When they have a matter, they come to me; and I judge between one and another, and I make"
2,18,17,"And Moses’ father in law said to him, The thing that thou doest"
2,18,18,"Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that"
2,18,19,"Hearken now to my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people toward God, that thou mayest bring the causes to God:"
2,18,20,"And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do."
2,18,21,"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place"
2,18,22,"And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be,"
2,18,23,"If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee"
2,18,24,"So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said."
2,18,25,"And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
2,18,26,"And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves."
2,18,27,"And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land."
2,19,1,"In the third month, when the children of Israel had gone forth from the land of Egypt, the same day they came"
2,19,2,"For they had departed from Rephidim, and had come"
2,19,3,"And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;"
2,19,4,"Ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and"
2,19,5,"Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a special treasure to me above all people: for all the earth"
2,19,6,"And ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These"
2,19,7,"And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him."
2,19,8,"And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people to the LORD."
2,19,9,"And the LORD said to Moses, Lo, I come to thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD."
2,19,10,"And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,"
2,19,11,"And be ready for the third day: for on the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai."
2,19,12,"And thou shalt set bounds to the people all around, saying, Take heed to yourselves,"
2,19,13,"There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether"
2,19,14,"And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes."
2,19,15,"And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day: come not at"
2,19,16,"And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that"
2,19,17,"And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the lower part of the mount."
2,19,18,"And mount Sinai was altogether in a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke of it ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount trembled greatly."
2,19,19,"And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice."
2,19,20,"And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up."
2,19,21,"And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish."
2,19,22,"And let the priests also, who come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them."
2,19,23,"And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it."
2,19,24,"And the LORD said to him, Away, go down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break forth upon them."
2,19,25,"So Moses went down to the people, and spoke to them."
2,20,1,"And God spoke all these words, saying,"
2,20,2,"I"
2,20,3,"Thou shalt have no other gods before me."
2,20,4,"Thou shalt not make to thee any graven image, or any likeness"
2,20,5,"Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God"
2,20,6,"And showing mercy to thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments."
2,20,7,"Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain."
2,20,8,"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy."
2,20,9,"Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:"
2,20,10,"But the seventh day"
2,20,11,"For"
2,20,12,"Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee."
2,20,13,"Thou shalt not kill."
2,20,14,"Thou shalt not commit adultery."
2,20,15,"Thou shalt not steal."
2,20,16,"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour."
2,20,17,"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor any thing that"
2,20,18,"And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw"
2,20,19,"And they said to Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die."
2,20,20,"And Moses said to the people, Fear not: for God is come to test you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not."
2,20,21,"And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God"
2,20,22,"And the LORD said to Moses, Thus thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven."
2,20,23,"Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make to you gods of gold."
2,20,24,"An altar of earth thou shalt make to me, and shalt sacrifice on it thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thy oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to thee, and I will bless thee."
2,20,25,"And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou shalt lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it."
2,20,26,"Neither shalt thou go up by steps to my altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered on it."
2,21,1,"Now these"
2,21,2,"If thou shalt buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall depart free for nothing."
2,21,3,"If he came in by himself, he shall depart by himself: if he was married, then his wife shall depart with him."
2,21,4,"If his master hath given him a wife, and she hath borne him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall depart by himself."
2,21,5,"And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not depart free:"
2,21,6,"Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever."
2,21,7,"And if a man shall sell his daughter to be a female slave, she shall not depart as the male slaves do."
2,21,8,"If she shall not please her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her to a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her."
2,21,9,"And if he hath betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters."
2,21,10,"If he shall take him another"
2,21,11,"And if he shall not perform these three"
2,21,12,"He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death."
2,21,13,"And if a man shall not lie in wait, but God shall deliver"
2,21,14,"But if a man shall come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from my altar, that he may die."
2,21,15,"And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death."
2,21,16,"And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he shall be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death."
2,21,17,"And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death."
2,21,18,"And if men contend together, and one shall smite another with a stone, or with"
2,21,19,"If he shall rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote"
2,21,20,"And if a man shall smite his male or female servant, with a rod, and he shall die under his hand; he shall be surely punished."
2,21,21,"However, if he shall continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he"
2,21,22,"If men shall contend, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit shall depart"
2,21,23,"And if"
2,21,24,"Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,"
2,21,25,"Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe."
2,21,26,"And if a man shall smite the eye of his male servant, or the eye of his female servant, that it shall perish; he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake."
2,21,27,"And if he shall smite out his male servant’s tooth, or his female servant’s tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake."
2,21,28,"If an ox shall gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox"
2,21,29,"But if the ox was accustomed to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not restrained him, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death."
2,21,30,"If there shall be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid upon him."
2,21,31,"Whether he hath gored a son, or hath gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done to him."
2,21,32,"If the ox shall push a male or female servant; he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned."
2,21,33,"And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or a donkey shall fall into it;"
2,21,34,"The owner of the pit shall make payment,"
2,21,35,"And if one man’s ox shall hurt another’s, that he shall die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead"
2,21,36,"Or if it shall be known that the ox was accustomed to push in time past, and his owner hath not restrained him; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own."
2,22,1,"If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep."
2,22,2,"If a thief shall be found breaking through, and be smitten that he die,"
2,22,3,"If the sun shall have risen upon him,"
2,22,4,"If the theft shall be certainly found in his hand alive, whether an ox, or donkey, or sheep; he shall restore double."
2,22,5,"If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man’s field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution."
2,22,6,"If fire shall break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field, shall be consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution."
2,22,7,"If a man shall deliver to his neighbour money or goods to keep, and it be stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief shall be found, let him pay double."
2,22,8,"If the thief shall not be found, then the master of the house shall be brought to the judges,"
2,22,9,"For all manner of trespass,"

2,22,18,"Thou shalt not allow a witch to live."
2,22,19,"Whoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death."
2,22,20,"He that sacrificeth to"

2,22,22,"Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child."
2,22,23,"If thou shalt afflict them in any way, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry;"
2,22,24,"And my wrath shall burn, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless."
2,22,25,"If thou shalt lend money to"

2,22,27,"For that"
2,22,28,"Thou shalt not revile the judges, nor curse the ruler of thy people."
2,22,29,"Thou shalt not delay"
2,22,30,"Likewise shalt thou do with thy oxen,"
2,22,31,"And ye shall be holy men to me: neither shall ye eat"
2,23,1,"Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness."
2,23,2,"Thou shalt not follow a multitude to"
2,23,3,"Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause."
2,23,4,"If thou shalt meet thy enemy’s ox or his donkey going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again."
2,23,5,"If thou shalt see the donkey of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him."
2,23,6,"Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of thy poor in his cause."
2,23,7,"Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked."
2,23,8,"And thou shalt take no bribe: for the bribe blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous."
2,23,9,"Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt."
2,23,10,"And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in its fruits:"
2,23,11,"But the seventh"
2,23,12,"Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thy ox and thy donkey may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed."
2,23,13,"And in all"
2,23,14,"Three times thou shalt keep a feast to me in the year."
2,23,15,"Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)"
2,23,16,"And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering,"

2,23,24,"Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images."
2,23,25,"And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee."
2,23,26,"There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: I will fulfil the number of thy days."
2,23,27,"I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thy enemies turn their backs to thee."

2,23,29,"I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land should become desolate, and the beast of the field should multiply against thee."
2,23,30,"By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou shalt be increased, and inherit the land."
2,23,31,"And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee."
2,23,32,"Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods."
2,23,33,"They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee to sin against me: for if thou shalt serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to thee."
2,24,1,"And he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off."

2,32,12,"Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For evil did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people."
2,32,13,"Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou sworest by thine own self, and saidst to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit"
2,32,14,"And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people."
2,32,15,"And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony"
2,32,16,"And the tables"
2,32,17,"And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses,"
2,32,18,"And he said,"
2,32,19,"And it came to pass, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses’ anger burned, and he cast the tables from his hands, and broke them beneath the mount."
2,32,20,"And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt"
2,32,21,"And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people to thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?"
2,32,22,"And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord burn: thou knowest the people, that they"
2,32,23,"For they said to me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for"
2,32,24,"And I said to them, Whoever hath any gold, let them break"
2,32,25,"And when Moses saw that the people"
2,32,26,"Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who"
2,32,27,"And he said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side,"
2,32,28,"And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men."
2,32,29,"For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day."
2,32,30,"And it came to pass on the next day, that Moses said to the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin."
2,32,31,"And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, O, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold."
2,32,32,"Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin ––; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written."
2,32,33,"And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book."
2,32,34,"Therefore now go, lead the people to"
2,32,35,"And the LORD afflicted the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made."
2,33,1,"And the LORD said to Moses, Depart,"
2,33,2,"And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:"
2,33,3,"To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou"
2,33,4,"And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man put on him his ornaments."
2,33,5,"For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, Ye"
2,33,6,"And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb."
2,33,7,"And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass,"
2,33,8,"And it came to pass, when Moses went out to the tabernacle,"
2,33,9,"And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood"
2,33,10,"And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand"
2,33,11,"And the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle."
2,33,12,"And Moses said to the LORD, See, thou sayest to me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight."
2,33,13,"Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation"
2,33,14,"And he said, My presence shall go"
2,33,15,"And he said to him, If thy presence go not"
2,33,16,"For how then shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight?"
2,33,17,"And the LORD said to Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name."
2,33,18,"And he said, I beseech thee, show me thy glory."
2,33,19,"And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy."
2,33,20,"And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live."
2,33,21,"And the LORD said, Behold,"
2,33,22,"And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:"
2,33,23,"And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen."
2,34,1,"And the LORD said to Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like the first: and I will write upon"
2,34,2,"And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount."
2,34,3,"And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount."
2,34,4,"And he hewed two tables of stone like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone."
2,34,5,"And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD."
2,34,6,"And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,"
2,34,7,"Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear"
2,34,8,"And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped."
2,34,9,"And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it"
2,34,10,"And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do wonders, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou"
2,34,11,"Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite."
2,34,12,"Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:"
2,34,13,"But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:"
2,34,14,"For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name"
2,34,15,"Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go astray after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and"
2,34,16,"And thou take of their daughters to thy sons, and their daughters go astray after their gods, and make thy sons go astray after their gods."
2,34,17,"Thou shalt make thee no molten gods."
2,34,18,"The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out of from Egypt."
2,34,19,"All that openeth the womb"
2,34,20,"But the firstling of a donkey thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou shalt not redeem"
2,34,21,"Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in time of plowing and in harvest thou shalt rest."
2,34,22,"And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year’s end."
2,34,23,"Three times in the year shall all your males appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel."
2,34,24,"For I will drive out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God three times in the year."
2,34,25,"Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left until the morning."
2,34,26,"The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring to the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in his mother’s milk."
2,34,27,"And the LORD said to Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel."
2,34,28,"And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread, nor drank water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments."
2,34,29,"And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him."
2,34,30,"And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him."
2,34,31,"And Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him: and Moses talked with them."
2,34,32,"And afterward all the children of Israel came near: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai."
2,34,33,"And"
2,34,34,"But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out. And he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel"
2,34,35,"And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him."
2,35,1,"And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said to them, These"
2,35,2,"Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whoever doth work in it shall be put to death."
2,35,3,"Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day."
2,35,4,"And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This"
2,35,5,"Take ye from among you an offering to the LORD: whoever"
2,35,6,"And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’"
2,35,7,"And rams’ skins dyed red, and badgers’ skins, and shittim wood,"
2,35,8,"And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,"
2,35,9,"And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate."
2,35,10,"And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded;"
2,35,11,"The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets,"
2,35,12,"The ark, and its staffs,"
2,35,13,"The table, and its staffs, and all its vessels, and the showbread,"
2,35,14,"The lampstand also for the light, and its furniture, and its lamps, with the oil for the light,"
2,35,15,"And the incense altar, and its staffs, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle,"
2,35,16,"The altar of burnt offering, with its brasen grate, its staffs, and all its vessels, the laver and its foot,"
2,35,17,"The hangings of the court, its pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,"
2,35,18,"The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,"
2,35,19,"The cloths of service, to do service in the holy"
2,35,20,"And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses."
2,35,21,"And they came, every one whose heart was stirred, and every one whom his spirit made willing,"
2,35,22,"And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted,"
2,35,23,"And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’"
2,35,24,"Every one that offered an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD’S offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought"
2,35,25,"And all the women that were wise hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun,"
2,35,26,"And all the women whose heart moved them in wisdom spun goats’"
2,35,27,"And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;"
2,35,28,"And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense."
2,35,29,"The children of Israel brought a willing offering to the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses."
2,35,30,"And Moses said to the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;"
2,35,31,"And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;"
2,35,32,"And to make beautifully wrought works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,"
2,35,33,"And in the cutting of stones, to set"
2,35,34,"And he hath put in his heart that he may teach,"
2,35,35,"He hath filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the skilful workmen, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver,"
2,36,1,"Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded."
2,36,2,"And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom,"
2,36,3,"And they received from Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it"
2,36,4,"And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;"
2,36,5,"And they spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make."
2,36,6,"And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing."
2,36,7,"For the things they had were sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much."
2,36,8,"And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains"
2,36,9,"The length of one curtain"
2,36,10,"And he coupled the five curtains one to another: and"
2,36,11,"And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the extremity of"
2,36,12,"Fifty loops he made in one curtain, and fifty loops he made in the edge of the curtain which"
2,36,13,"And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so it became one tabernacle."
2,36,14,"And he made curtains"
2,36,15,"The length of one curtain"
2,36,16,"And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves."
2,36,17,"And he made fifty loops upon the outer edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second."
2,36,18,"And he made fifty clasps"
2,36,19,"And he made a covering for the tent"
2,36,20,"And he made boards for the tabernacle"
2,36,21,"The length of a board"
2,36,22,"One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle."
2,36,23,"And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:"
2,36,24,"And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons."
2,36,25,"And for the other side of the tabernacle,"
2,36,26,"And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board."
2,36,27,"And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards."
2,36,28,"And two boards he made for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides."
2,36,29,"And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at its head, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners."
2,36,30,"And there were eight boards; and their sockets"
2,36,31,"And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,"
2,36,32,"And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward."
2,36,33,"And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other."
2,36,34,"And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings"
2,36,35,"And he made a veil"
2,36,36,"And he made for it four pillars"
2,36,37,"And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door"
2,36,38,"And its five pillars with their hooks: and he overlaid their tops and their bands with gold: but their five sockets"
2,37,1,"And Bezaleel made the ark"
2,37,2,"And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold for it all around."
2,37,3,"And he cast for it four rings of gold,"
2,37,4,"And he made staffs"
2,37,5,"And he put the staffs into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark."
2,37,6,"And he made the mercy seat"
2,37,7,"And he made two cherubim"
2,37,8,"One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the"

2,37,12,"Also he made for it a border of an handbreadth all around; and made a crown of gold for its border all around."
2,37,13,"And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that"
2,37,14,"Close to the border were the rings, the places for the staffs to bear the table."
2,37,15,"And he made the staffs"
2,37,16,"And he made the vessels which"
2,37,17,"And he made the lampstand"

2,40,3,"And thou shalt put in it the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the veil."
2,40,4,"And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the lampstand, and light its lamps."
2,40,5,"And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle."
2,40,6,"And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation."
2,40,7,"And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water in it."
2,40,8,"And thou shalt set up the court all around, and hang up the hanging at the court gate."
2,40,9,"And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that"
2,40,10,"And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy."

2,40,14,"And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:"
2,40,15,"And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister to me in the priest’s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations."

2,40,20,"And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staffs on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:"
2,40,21,"And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses."
2,40,22,"And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, outside the veil."
2,40,23,"And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses."
2,40,24,"And he put the lampstand in the tent of the congregation, opposite the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward."
2,40,25,"And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses."
2,40,26,"And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the veil:"
2,40,27,"And he burnt sweet incense on it; as the LORD commanded Moses."
2,40,28,"And he set up the hanging"
2,40,29,"And he put the altar of burnt offering"
2,40,30,"And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash"
2,40,31,"And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet from it:"
2,40,32,"When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near to the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses."
2,40,33,"And he reared up the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work."
2,40,34,"Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle."
2,40,35,"And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle."
2,40,36,"And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:"
2,40,37,"But if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up."

4,6,11,"And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day."
4,6,12,"And he shall consecrate to the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled."
4,6,13,"And this"
4,6,14,"And he shall offer his offering to the LORD, one male lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,"
4,6,15,"And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings."
4,6,16,"And the priest shall bring"
4,6,17,"And he shall offer the ram"

4,6,22,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
4,6,23,"Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, In this way ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them,"
4,6,24,"The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:"
4,6,25,"The LORD make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious to thee:"

4,7,8,"And four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest."
4,7,9,"But to the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging to them"
4,7,10,"And the princes offered for dedicating the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar."
4,7,11,"And the LORD said to Moses, They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar."

4,18,7,"Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest’s office for every thing of the altar, and within the veil; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest’s office"
4,18,8,"And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of my heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever."
4,18,9,"This shall be thine of the most holy things,"
4,18,10,"In the most holy"
4,18,11,"And this"
4,18,12,"All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, them have I given to thee."
4,18,13,""
4,18,14,"Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine."
4,18,15,"Every thing that openeth the womb in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD,"
4,18,16,"And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thy estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which"
4,18,17,"But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they"
4,18,18,"And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine."
4,18,19,"All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given to thee, and to thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it"
4,18,20,"And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I"
4,18,21,"And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve,"
4,18,22,"Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come near the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die."
4,18,23,"But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity:"
4,18,24,"But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer"
4,18,25,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
4,18,26,"Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD,"
4,18,27,"And"
4,18,28,"Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering to the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give of them the LORD’S heave offering to Aaron the priest."
4,18,29,"Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best of it,"
4,18,30,"Therefore thou shalt say to them, When ye have offered the best of it, then it shall be counted to the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress."
4,18,31,"And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it"
4,18,32,"And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have offered from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die."
4,19,1,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
4,19,2,"This"
4,19,3,"And ye shall give her to Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth outside the camp, and"
4,19,4,"And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:"
4,19,5,"And"
4,19,6,"And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast"
4,19,7,"Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening."
4,19,8,"And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening."
4,19,9,"And a man"
4,19,10,"And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever."
4,19,11,"He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days."
4,19,12,"He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he shall not purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean."
4,19,13,"Whoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness"
4,19,14,"This"
4,19,15,"And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it,"
4,19,16,"And whoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days."
4,19,17,"And for an unclean"
4,19,18,"And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip"
4,19,19,"And the clean"
4,19,20,"But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he"
4,19,21,"And it shall be a perpetual statute to them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until the evening."
4,19,22,"And whatever the unclean"
4,20,1,"Then came the children of Israel,"
4,20,2,"And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron."
4,20,3,"And the people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying, O that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!"
4,20,4,"And why have ye brought the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?"
4,20,5,"And why have ye made us come up from Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? it"
4,20,6,"And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared to them."
4,20,7,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
4,20,8,"Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye to the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth its water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give water to the congregation and their beasts."
4,20,9,"And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him."
4,20,10,"And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?"
4,20,11,"And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts"
4,20,12,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them."
4,20,13,"This"
4,20,14,"And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:"
4,20,15,"How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians afflicted us, and our fathers:"
4,20,16,"And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth from Egypt: and, behold, we"
4,20,17,"Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink"
4,20,18,"And Edom said to him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword."
4,20,19,"And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the highway: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without"
4,20,20,"And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand."
4,20,21,"Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: therefore Israel turned away from him."
4,20,22,"And the children of Israel,"
4,20,23,"And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,"
4,20,24,"Aaron shall be gathered to his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah."
4,20,25,"Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to mount Hor:"
4,20,26,"And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered"
4,20,27,"And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up to mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation."
4,20,28,"And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount."
4,20,29,"And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days,"
4,21,1,"And"
4,21,2,"And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities."
4,21,3,"And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah."
4,21,4,"And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to go around the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way."
4,21,5,"And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have ye brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for"
4,21,6,"And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died."
4,21,7,"Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people."
4,21,8,"And the LORD said to Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live."
4,21,9,"And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived."
4,21,10,"And the children of Israel moved forward, and encamped in Oboth."
4,21,11,"And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which"
4,21,12,"From there they removed, and encamped in the valley of Zared."
4,21,13,"From there they removed, and encamped on the other side of Arnon, which"
4,21,14,"Therefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,"
4,21,15,"And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab."
4,21,16,"And from there"
4,21,17,"Then Israel sung this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye to it:"
4,21,18,"The princes searched out the well, the nobles of the people dug it, by"
4,21,19,"And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:"
4,21,20,"And from Bamoth"
4,21,21,"And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,"
4,21,22,"Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink"
4,21,23,"And Sihon would not permit Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel."
4,21,24,"And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon"
4,21,25,"And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages."
4,21,26,"For Heshbon"
4,21,27,"Therefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:"
4,21,28,"For there hast a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab,"
4,21,29,"Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites."
4,21,30,"We have shot at them; Heshbon hast perished even to Dibon, and we have laid them waste even to Nophah, which"
4,21,31,"Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites."
4,21,32,"And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took its villages, and drove out the Amorites that"
4,21,33,"And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei."
4,21,34,"And the LORD said to Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon."
4,21,35,"So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left to him alive: and they possessed his land."
4,22,1,"And the children of Israel moved forward, and encamped in the plains of Moab on this side of Jordan"
4,22,2,"And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites."
4,22,3,"And Moab was greatly afraid of the people, because they"
4,22,4,"And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all"
4,22,5,"He sent messengers therefore to Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which"
4,22,6,"Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse for me this people; for they"
4,22,7,"And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak."
4,22,8,"And he said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak to me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam."
4,22,9,"And God came to Balaam, and said, What men"
4,22,10,"And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent to me,"
4,22,11,"Behold,"
4,22,12,"And God said to Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they"
4,22,13,"And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Go back to your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you."
4,22,14,"And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us."
4,22,15,"And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they."
4,22,16,"And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming to me:"
4,22,17,"For I will promote thee to very great honour, and I will do whatever thou sayest to me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse this people for me."
4,22,18,"And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more."
4,22,19,"Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say to me more."
4,22,20,"And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men come to call thee, rise,"
4,22,21,"And Balaam rose in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab."
4,22,22,"And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his donkey, and his two servants"
4,22,23,"And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the donkey, to turn her into the way."
4,22,24,"But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall"
4,22,25,"And when the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again."
4,22,26,"And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where"
4,22,27,"And when the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the donkey with a staff."
4,22,28,"And the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?"
4,22,29,"And Balaam said to the donkey, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill thee."
4,22,30,"And the donkey said to Balaam,"
4,22,31,"Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face."
4,22,32,"And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why hast thou smitten thy donkey these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because"
4,22,33,"And the donkey saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive."
4,22,34,"And Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will return again."
4,22,35,"And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak to thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak."
4,22,36,"And when Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to a city of Moab, which"
4,22,37,"And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to thee to call thee? why camest thou not to me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?"
4,22,38,"And Balaam said to Balak, Lo, I have come to thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak."
4,22,39,"And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjathhuzoth."
4,22,40,"And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that"
4,22,41,"And it came to pass on the next morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up to the high places of Baal, that from there he might see the utmost"
4,23,1,"And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams."
4,23,2,"And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on"
4,23,3,"And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: perhaps the LORD will come to meet me: and whatever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place."
4,23,4,"And God met Balaam: and he said to him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon"
4,23,5,"And the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus thou shalt speak."
4,23,6,"And he returned to him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab."
4,23,7,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,"
4,23,8,"How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,"
4,23,9,"For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations."
4,23,10,"Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth"
4,23,11,"And Balak said to Balaam, What hast thou done to me? I took thee to curse my enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed"
4,23,12,"And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?"
4,23,13,"And Balak said to him, Come, I pray thee, with me to another place, from which thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and from there curse them for me."
4,23,14,"And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on"
4,23,15,"And he said to Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet"
4,23,16,"And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again to Balak, and say thus."
4,23,17,"And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What hath the LORD spoken?"
4,23,18,"And he took up his parable, and said, Rise, Balak, and hear; hearken to me, thou son of Zippor:"
4,23,19,"God"
4,23,20,"Behold, I have received"
4,23,21,"He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God"
4,23,22,"God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn."
4,23,23,"Surely"
4,23,24,"Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he shall eat"
4,23,25,"And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all."
4,23,26,"But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?"
4,23,27,"And Balak said to Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee to another place; perhaps it will please God that thou mayest from there curse them for me."
4,23,28,"And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon."
4,23,29,"And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams."
4,23,30,"And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on"
4,24,1,"And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness."
4,24,2,"And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding"
4,24,3,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:"
4,24,4,"He hath said, who heard the words of God, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling"
4,24,5,"How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob,"
4,24,6,"As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river’s side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted,"
4,24,7,"He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed"
4,24,8,"God brought him forth from Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce"
4,24,9,"He crouched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall rouse him? Blessed"
4,24,10,"And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said to Balaam, I called thee to curse my enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed"
4,24,11,"Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee to great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour."
4,24,12,"And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not speak also to thy messengers whom thou sentest to me, saying,"
4,24,13,"If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do"
4,24,14,"And now, behold, I go to my people: come"
4,24,15,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:"
4,24,16,"He hath said, who heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High,"
4,24,17,"I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth."
4,24,18,"And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly."
4,24,19,"Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city."
4,24,20,"And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek"
4,24,21,"And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock."
4,24,22,"Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive."
4,24,23,"And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!"
4,24,24,"And ships"
4,24,25,"And Balaam arose, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way."
4,25,1,"And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab."
4,25,2,"And they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods: and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods."
4,25,3,"And Israel joined himself to Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel."
4,25,4,"And the LORD said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD before the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel."
4,25,5,"And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined to Baalpeor."
4,25,6,"And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who"
4,25,7,"And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw"
4,25,8,"And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel."
4,25,9,"And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand."
4,25,10,"And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,"
4,25,11,"Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy."
4,25,12,"Therefore say, Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace:"
4,25,13,"And he shall have it, and his seed after him,"
4,25,14,"Now the name of the Israelite that was slain,"
4,25,15,"And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain"

6,5,10,"And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho."
6,5,11,"And they ate of the old grain of the land on the next day after the passover, unleavened cakes, and roasted"
6,5,12,"And the manna ceased on the next day after they had eaten of the old grain of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year."
6,5,13,"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him,"
6,5,14,"And he said, Nay; but"
6,5,15,"And the captain of the LORD’S host said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place on which thou standest"
6,6,1,"Now Jericho was securely shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in."
6,6,2,"And the LORD said to Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and its king,"
6,6,3,"And ye shall march around the city, all"
6,6,4,"And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams’ horns: and the seventh day ye shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets."
6,6,5,"And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long"
6,6,6,"And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD."
6,6,7,"And he said to the people, Pass on, and march around the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD."
6,6,8,"And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them."
6,6,9,"And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark,"
6,6,10,"And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall"
6,6,11,"So the ark of the LORD went around the city, going about"
6,6,12,"And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD."
6,6,13,"And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD,"
6,6,14,"And the second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days."
6,6,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and marched around the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they marched around the city seven times."
6,6,16,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city."
6,6,17,"And the city shall be accursed,"
6,6,18,"And ye, in every way keep"
6,6,19,"But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,"
6,6,20,"So the people shouted when"
6,6,21,"And they utterly destroyed all that"
6,6,22,"But Joshua had said to the two men that spied out the country, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out from there the woman, and all that she hath, as ye swore to her."
6,6,23,"And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them outside the camp of Israel."
6,6,24,"And they burnt the city with fire, and all that"
6,6,25,"And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel"
6,6,26,"And Joshua charged"
6,6,27,"So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was"
6,7,1,"But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel."
6,7,2,"And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which"
6,7,3,"And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai;"
6,7,4,"So there went up there from the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai."
6,7,5,"And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them"
6,7,6,"And Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads."
6,7,7,"And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, why hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? O that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of Jordan!"
6,7,8,"O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!"
6,7,9,"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear"
6,7,10,"And the LORD said to Joshua, Arise; why liest thou thus upon thy face?"
6,7,11,"Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and deceived also, and they have put"
6,7,12,"Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies,"
6,7,13,"Rise, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves for to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel,"
6,7,14,"In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be,"
6,7,15,"And it shall be,"
6,7,16,"So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:"
6,7,17,"And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:"
6,7,18,"And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken."
6,7,19,"And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide"
6,7,20,"And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:"
6,7,21,"When I saw among the spoils a beautiful Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they"
6,7,22,"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and, behold,"
6,7,23,"And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD."
6,7,24,"And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor."
6,7,25,"And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones."
6,7,26,"And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, to this day."
6,8,1,"And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:"
6,8,2,"And thou shalt do to Ai and its king as thou didst to Jericho and its king: only its spoil, and its cattle, shall ye take for a prey to yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it."
6,8,3,"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night."
6,8,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city,"
6,8,5,"And I, and all the people that"
6,8,6,"(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them."
6,8,7,"Then ye shall rise from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand."
6,8,8,"And it shall be, when ye have taken the city,"
6,8,9,"Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people."
6,8,10,"And Joshua rose early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai."
6,8,11,"And all the people,"
6,8,12,"And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city."
6,8,13,"And when they had set the people,"
6,8,14,"And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw"
6,8,15,"And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness."
6,8,16,"And all the people that"
6,8,17,"And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued Israel."
6,8,18,"And the LORD said to Joshua, Stretch out the spear that"
6,8,19,"And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire."
6,8,20,"And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers."
6,8,21,"And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai."
6,8,22,"And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape."
6,8,23,"And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua."
6,8,24,"And it came to pass, when Israel had finished slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they chased them, and when they had all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword."
6,8,25,"And"
6,8,26,"For Joshua drew not his hand back, with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai."
6,8,27,"Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey to themselves, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua."
6,8,28,"And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever,"
6,8,29,"And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raise over it a great heap of stones,"
6,8,30,"Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,"
6,8,31,"As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lifted up"
6,8,32,"And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel."
6,8,33,"And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them opposite mount Gerizim, and half of them opposite mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel."
6,8,34,"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law."
6,8,35,"There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them."
6,9,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings who"
6,9,2,"That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord."
6,9,3,"And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,"
6,9,4,"They also worked deceitfully, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their donkeys, and wine bottles, old, and torn, and bound up;"
6,9,5,"And old and patched shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry"
6,9,6,"And they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, We have come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us."
6,9,7,"And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, Perhaps ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?"
6,9,8,"And they said to Joshua, We"
6,9,9,"And they said to him, From a very far country thy servants have come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,"
6,9,10,"And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that"
6,9,11,"Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We"
6,9,12,"This our bread we took hot"
6,9,13,"And these bottles of wine, which we filled,"
6,9,14,"And the men took of their provisions, and asked not"
6,9,15,"And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation swore to them."
6,9,16,"And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they"
6,9,17,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities"
6,9,18,"And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes."
6,9,19,"But all the princes said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them."
6,9,20,"This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore to them."
6,9,21,"And the princes said to them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation; as the princes had promised them."
6,9,22,"And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have ye deceived us, saying, We"
6,9,23,"Now therefore ye"
6,9,24,"And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were greatly afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing."
6,9,25,"And now, behold, we"
6,9,26,"And so did he to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not."
6,9,27,"And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even to this day, in the place which he should choose."
6,10,1,"Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;"
6,10,2,"That they feared greatly, because Gibeon"
6,10,3,"Therefore Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,"
6,10,4,"Come up to me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel."
6,10,5,"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it."
6,10,6,"And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, saying, Do not forsake thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us."
6,10,7,"So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour."
6,10,8,"And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee."
6,10,9,"Joshua therefore came to them suddenly,"
6,10,10,"And the LORD destroyed them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah."
6,10,11,"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel,"
6,10,12,"Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon."
6,10,13,"And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies."
6,10,14,"And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened to the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel."
6,10,15,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal."
6,10,16,"But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah."
6,10,17,"And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah."
6,10,18,"And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:"
6,10,19,"And stay you not,"
6,10,20,"And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had finished slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest"
6,10,21,"And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel."
6,10,22,"Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings to me out of the cave."
6,10,23,"And they did so, and brought those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish,"
6,10,24,"And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them."
6,10,25,"And Joshua said to them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight."
6,10,26,"And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening."
6,10,27,"And it came to pass at the time of the setting of the sun,"
6,10,28,"And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that"
6,10,29,"Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah:"
6,10,30,"And the LORD delivered it also, and its king, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that"
6,10,31,"And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:"
6,10,32,"And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that"
6,10,33,"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining."
6,10,34,"And from Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:"
6,10,35,"And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that"
6,10,36,"And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it:"
6,10,37,"And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its cities and all the souls that"
6,10,38,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:"
6,10,39,"And he took it, and its king, and all its cities; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that"
6,10,40,"So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded."
6,10,41,"And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon."
6,10,42,"And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel."
6,10,43,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp in Gilgal."
6,11,1,"And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard"
6,11,2,"And to the kings that"
6,11,3,""
6,11,4,"And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, many people, even as the sand that"
6,11,5,"And when all these kings were met together, they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel."
6,11,6,"And the LORD said to Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire."
6,11,7,"So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them."
6,11,8,"And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them to great Zidon, and to Misrephothmaim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left to them none remaining."
6,11,9,"And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him: he hamstrung their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire."
6,11,10,"And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote its king with the sword: for Hazor in times past was the head of all those kingdoms."
6,11,11,"And they smote all the souls that"
6,11,12,"And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, Joshua took, and smote them with the edge of the sword,"
6,11,13,"But"
6,11,14,"And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey to themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe."
6,11,15,"As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses."
6,11,16,"So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;"
6,11,17,""
6,11,18,"Joshua made war a long time with all those kings."
6,11,19,"There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all"
6,11,20,"For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly,"
6,11,21,"And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities."
6,11,22,"There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained."
6,11,23,"So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war."
6,12,1,"Now these"
6,12,2,"Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon,"
6,12,3,"And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and to the sea of the plain,"
6,12,4,"And the land of Og king of Bashan,"
6,12,5,"And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon."
6,12,6,"Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it"
6,12,7,"And these"
6,12,8,"In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:"
6,12,9,"The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which"
6,12,10,"The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;"
6,12,11,"The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;"

6,21,41,"All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel"
6,21,42,"These cities were every one with their common lands surrounding them: thus"
6,21,43,"And the LORD gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt in it."
6,21,44,"And the LORD gave them rest on all sides, according to all that he swore to their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand."
6,21,45,"There failed nothing of any good thing which the LORD had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass."
6,22,1,"Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,"
6,22,2,"And said to them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:"
6,22,3,"Ye have not left your brethren these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God."
6,22,4,"And now the LORD your God hath given rest to your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and go to your tents,"
6,22,5,"But take diligent heed to perform the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to hold fast to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul."
6,22,6,"So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went to their tents."
6,22,7,"Now to the"
6,22,8,"And he spoke to them, saying, Return with much riches to your tents, and with very many cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren."
6,22,9,"And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which"
6,22,10,"And when they came to the borders of Jordan, that"
6,22,11,"And the children of Israel heard it said, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the border of the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, on the side belonging to the children of Israel."
6,22,12,"And when the children of Israel heard"
6,22,13,"And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,"
6,22,14,"And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one"
6,22,15,"And they came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,"
6,22,16,"Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass"
6,22,17,""
6,22,18,"But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be,"
6,22,19,"However, if the land of your possession"
6,22,20,"Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fall on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity."
6,22,21,"Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said to the heads of the thousands of Israel,"
6,22,22,"The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if"
6,22,23,"That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer on it burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings on it, let the LORD himself require"
6,22,24,"And if we have not"
6,22,25,"For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD."
6,22,26,"Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:"
6,22,27,"But"
6,22,28,"Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they shall"
6,22,29,"Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, besides the altar of the LORD our God that"
6,22,30,"And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel who"
6,22,31,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD"
6,22,32,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again."
6,22,33,"And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt."
6,22,34,"And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar"
6,23,1,"And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies on all sides, that Joshua became old"
6,23,2,"And Joshua called for all Israel,"
6,23,3,"And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done to all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God"
6,23,4,"Behold, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea westward."
6,23,5,"And the LORD your God, he shall drive them out from before you, and drive them from your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised to you."
6,23,6,"Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside from it"
6,23,7,"That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear"
6,23,8,"But hold fast to the LORD your God, as ye have done to this day."
6,23,9,"For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but"
6,23,10,"One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he"
6,23,11,"Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God."
6,23,12,"Else if ye do in any way go back, and follow after the remnant of these nations,"
6,23,13,"Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out"
6,23,14,"And, behold, this day I"
6,23,15,"Therefore it shall come to pass,"
6,23,16,"When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given to you."
6,24,1,"And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God."
6,24,2,"And Joshua said to all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the river of old,"
6,24,3,"And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the river, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac."
6,24,4,"And I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt."
6,24,5,"I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out."
6,24,6,"And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red sea."
6,24,7,"And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season."
6,24,8,"And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you."
6,24,9,"Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:"
6,24,10,"But I would not hearken to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand."
6,24,11,"And ye went over Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand."
6,24,12,"And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you,"
6,24,13,"And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat."
6,24,14,"Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the river, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD."
6,24,15,"And if it seemeth evil to you to serve the LORD, choose for yourselves this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that"
6,24,16,"And the people answered and said, Be it far from us that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;"
6,24,17,"For the LORD our God, he"
6,24,18,"And the LORD drove out from before us all the people, even the Amorites who dwelt in the land:"
6,24,19,"And Joshua said to the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he"
6,24,20,"If ye forsake the LORD, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm, and consume you, after that he hath done you good."
6,24,21,"And the people said to Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD."
6,24,22,"And Joshua said to the people, Ye"
6,24,23,"Now therefore put away,"
6,24,24,"And the people said to Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey."
6,24,25,"So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem."
6,24,26,"And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that"
6,24,27,"And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke to us: it shall be therefore a witness to you, lest ye deny your God."
6,24,28,"So Joshua let the people depart, every man to his inheritance."
6,24,29,"And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died,"
6,24,30,"And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which"
6,24,31,"And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and who had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel."
6,24,32,"And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph."
6,24,33,"And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill"
7,1,1,"Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?"
7,1,2,"And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand."
7,1,3,"And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him."
7,1,4,"And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men."
7,1,5,"And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites."
7,1,6,"But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes."
7,1,7,"And Adonibezek said, seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered"
7,1,8,"Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire."
7,1,9,"And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt on the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley."
7,1,10,"And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before"
7,1,11,"And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before"
7,1,12,"And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife."
7,1,13,"And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife."
7,1,14,"And it came to pass, when she came"
7,1,15,"And she said to him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs."
7,1,16,"And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which"
7,1,17,"And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah."
7,1,18,"Also Judah took Gaza with its land, and Askelon with its land, and Ekron with its land."
7,1,19,"And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out"
7,1,20,"And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said: and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak."
7,1,21,"And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day."
7,1,22,"And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD"
7,1,23,"And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (Now the name of the city before"
7,1,24,"And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee mercy."
7,1,25,"And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family."
7,1,26,"And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name of it Luz: which"
7,1,27,"Neither did Manasseh drive out"
7,1,28,"And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to forced labour, and did not utterly drive them out."
7,1,29,"Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them."
7,1,30,"Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became forced labourers."
7,1,31,"Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:"
7,1,32,"But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out."
7,1,33,"Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became forced labourers to them."
7,1,34,"And the Amorites forced the children of Dan to the mountain: for they would not allow them to come down to the valley:"
7,1,35,"But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became forced labourers."
7,1,36,"And the border of the Amorites"
7,2,1,"And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to depart from Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you."
7,2,2,"And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?"
7,2,3,"Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be"
7,2,4,"And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept."
7,2,5,"And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to the LORD."
7,2,6,"And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land."
7,2,7,"And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel."
7,2,8,"And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died,"
7,2,9,"And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash."
7,2,10,"And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel."
7,2,11,"And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:"
7,2,12,"And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that"
7,2,13,"And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth."
7,2,14,"And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies around"
7,2,15,"Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed."
7,2,16,"Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, who delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them."
7,2,17,"And yet they would not hearken to their judges, but they played the harlot with other gods, and bowed themselves to them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD;"
7,2,18,"And when the LORD raised up judges for them, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for the LORD repented because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and burdened them."
7,2,19,"And it came to pass, when the judge was dead,"
7,2,20,"And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened to my voice;"
7,2,21,"I also will not henceforth drive out from before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died:"
7,2,22,"That through them I may test Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk in it, as their fathers kept"
7,2,23,"Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out speedily; neither did he deliver them into the hand of Joshua."
7,3,1,"Now these"
7,3,2,"Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it;"
7,3,3,""
7,3,4,"And they were to test Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken to the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses."
7,3,5,"And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:"
7,3,6,"And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods."
7,3,7,"And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves."
7,3,8,"Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years."
7,3,9,"And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them,"
7,3,10,"And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim."
7,3,11,"And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died."
7,3,12,"And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD."
7,3,13,"And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees."
7,3,14,"So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years."
7,3,15,"But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent tribute to Eglon king of Moab."
7,3,16,"But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh."
7,3,17,"And he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon"
7,3,18,"And when he had finished offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bore the tribute."
7,3,19,"But he himself turned back at the quarries that"
7,3,20,"And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God to thee. And he arose from"
7,3,21,"And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:"
7,3,22,"And the handle also entered after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out."
7,3,23,"Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them."
7,3,24,"When he had gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour"
7,3,25,"And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened"
7,3,26,"And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirath."
7,3,27,"And it came to pass, when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them."
7,3,28,"And he said to them, Follow me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and permitted not a man to pass over."
7,3,29,"And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all stout, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man."
7,3,30,"So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years."
7,3,31,"And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel."
7,4,1,"And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud was dead."
7,4,2,"And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host"
7,4,3,"And the children of Israel cried to the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel."
7,4,4,"And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time."
7,4,5,"And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment."
7,4,6,"And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedeshnaphtali, and said to him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded,"
7,4,7,"And I will draw to thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand."
7,4,8,"And Barak said to her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me,"
7,4,9,"And she said, I will surely go with thee: however the journey that thou takest shall not be for thy honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh."
7,4,10,"And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him."
7,4,11,"Now Heber the Kenite,"
7,4,12,"And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor."
7,4,13,"And Sisera gathered together all his chariots,"
7,4,14,"And Deborah said to Barak, Arise; for this"
7,4,15,"And the LORD destroyed Sisera, and all"
7,4,16,"But Barak pursued the chariots, and the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword;"
7,4,17,"However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for"
7,4,18,"And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle."
7,4,19,"And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him."
7,4,20,"Again he said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No."
7,4,21,"Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died."
7,4,22,"And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her"
7,4,23,"So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel."
7,4,24,"And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan."
7,5,1,"Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,"
7,5,2,"Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves."
7,5,3,"Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I,"
7,5,4,"LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou didst march out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens poured, the clouds also poured water."
7,5,5,"The mountains melted from before the LORD,"
7,5,6,"In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways."
7,5,7,""
7,5,8,"They chose new gods; then"
7,5,9,"My heart"

7,7,22,"And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man’s sword against his companion, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath,"
7,7,23,"And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued the Midianites."
7,7,24,"And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan."
7,7,25,"And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of Jordan."
7,8,1,"And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why hast thou done this to us, that thou didst call us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did contend with him sharply."
7,8,2,"And he said to them, What have I done now in comparison of you?"
7,8,3,"God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then, when he had said that, their anger toward him abated."
7,8,4,"And Gideon came to Jordan,"
7,8,5,"And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people that follow me; for they"
7,8,6,"And the princes of Succoth said,"
7,8,7,"And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers."
7,8,8,"And he went up from there to Penuel, and spoke to them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered"
7,8,9,"And he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower."
7,8,10,"Now Zebah and Zalmunna"
7,8,11,"And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure."
7,8,12,"And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and overcame all the host."
7,8,13,"And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun"
7,8,14,"And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and its elders,"
7,8,15,"And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye upbraided me, saying,"
7,8,16,"And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth."
7,8,17,"And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city."
7,8,18,"Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men"
7,8,19,"And he said, They"
7,8,20,"And he said to Jether his firstborn, Arise,"
7,8,21,"Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man"
7,8,22,"Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian."
7,8,23,"And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you."
7,8,24,"And Gideon said to them, I would desire a request of you, that you would give me every man the earrings of his spoil. (For they had golden earrings, because they"
7,8,25,"And they answered, We will willingly give"
7,8,26,"And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred"
7,8,27,"And Gideon made of it an ephod, and put it in his city,"
7,8,28,"Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they raised their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon."
7,8,29,"And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house."
7,8,30,"And Gideon had seventy sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives."
7,8,31,"And his concubine that"
7,8,32,"And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites."
7,8,33,"And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went playing the harlot with Baalim, and made Baalberith their god."
7,8,34,"And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side:"
7,8,35,"Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,"
7,9,1,"And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother’s brethren, and talked with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,"
7,9,2,"Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Which"
7,9,3,"And his mother’s brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He"
7,9,4,"And they gave him seventy"
7,9,5,"And he went to his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal,"
7,9,6,"And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that"
7,9,7,"And when they told"
7,9,8,"The trees went forth"
7,9,9,"But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
7,9,10,"And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou,"
7,9,11,"But the fig tree said to them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
7,9,12,"Then said the trees to the vine, Come thou,"
7,9,13,"And the vine said to them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
7,9,14,"Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come thou,"
7,9,15,"And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you,"
7,9,16,"Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands;"
7,9,17,"(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you from the hand of Midian:"
7,9,18,"And ye have risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he"
7,9,19,"If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day,"
7,9,20,"But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech."
7,9,21,"And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother."
7,9,22,"When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,"
7,9,23,"Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:"
7,9,24,"That the cruelty"
7,9,25,"And the men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech."
7,9,26,"And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him."
7,9,27,"And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trod"
7,9,28,"And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who"
7,9,29,"And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thy army, and come out."
7,9,30,"And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled."
7,9,31,"And he sent messengers to Abimelech deceitfully, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee."
7,9,32,"Now therefore rise up by night, thou and the people that"
7,9,33,"And it shall be,"
7,9,34,"And Abimelech rose, and all the people that"
7,9,35,"And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose, and the people that"
7,9,36,"And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as"
7,9,37,"And Gaal spoke again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim."
7,9,38,"Then said Zebul to him, Where"
7,9,39,"And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech."
7,9,40,"And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown"
7,9,41,"And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem."
7,9,42,"And it came to pass on the next day, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech."
7,9,43,"And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people"
7,9,44,"And Abimelech, and the company that"
7,9,45,"And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that"
7,9,46,"And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard"
7,9,47,"And it was told to Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together."
7,9,48,"And Abimelech went up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that"
7,9,49,"And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put"
7,9,50,"Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it."
7,9,51,"But there was a strong tower within the city, and to there fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut"
7,9,52,"And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and came near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire."
7,9,53,"And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech’s head, and broke his skull."
7,9,54,"Then he called hastily to the young man his armourbearer, and said to him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died."
7,9,55,"And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place."
7,9,56,"Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:"
7,9,57,"And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal."
7,10,1,"And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim."
7,10,2,"And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir."
7,10,3,"And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years."
7,10,4,"And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty young donkeys, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which"
7,10,5,"And Jair died, and was buried in Camon."
7,10,6,"And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him."
7,10,7,"And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon."
7,10,8,"And that year they afflicted and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that"
7,10,9,"Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was greatly distressed."
7,10,10,"And the children of Israel cried to the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim."
7,10,11,"And the LORD said to the children of Israel,"
7,10,12,"The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, oppressed you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand."
7,10,13,"Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: therefore I will deliver you no more."
7,10,14,"Go and cry to the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation."
7,10,15,"And the children of Israel said to the LORD, We have sinned: do thou to us whatever seemeth good to thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day."
7,10,16,"And they put away the foreign gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel."
7,10,17,"Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh."
7,10,18,"And the people"
7,11,1,"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he"
7,11,2,"And Gilead’s wife bore him sons; and his wife’s sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said to him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father’s house; for thou"
7,11,3,"Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered worthless men to Jephthah, and"
7,11,4,"And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel."
7,11,5,"And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah out of the land of Tob:"
7,11,6,"And they said to Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon."
7,11,7,"And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did ye not hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house? and why have ye come to me now when ye are in distress?"
7,11,8,"And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
7,11,9,"And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?"
7,11,10,"And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, The LORD be a witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words."
7,11,11,"Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh."
7,11,12,"And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou hast come against me to fight in my land?"
7,11,13,"And the king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and to Jordan: now therefore restore those"
7,11,14,"And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon:"
7,11,15,"And said to him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:"
7,11,16,"But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness to the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;"
7,11,17,"Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken"
7,11,18,"Then they went along through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and encamped on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon"
7,11,19,"And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land to my place."
7,11,20,"But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his land: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel."
7,11,21,"And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country."
7,11,22,"And they possessed all the land of the Amorites, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to Jordan."
7,11,23,"So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?"
7,11,24,"Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess."
7,11,25,"And now"
7,11,26,"While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that"
7,11,27,"Therefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon."
7,11,28,"But the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthah which he sent him."
7,11,29,"Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over"

7,20,23,"(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)"
7,20,24,"And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day."
7,20,25,"And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword."
7,20,26,"Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD."
7,20,27,"And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God"
7,20,28,"And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thy hand."
7,20,29,"And Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah."
7,20,30,"And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times."
7,20,31,"And the children of Benjamin went out against the people,"
7,20,32,"And the children of Benjamin said, They"
7,20,33,"And all the men of Israel rose out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and those of Israel who were in ambush came forth out of their places,"
7,20,34,"And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was fierce: but they knew not that evil"
7,20,35,"And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword."
7,20,36,"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted to the ones lying in ambush which they had set beside Gibeah."
7,20,37,"And those in ambush hastened, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the ones lying in ambush drew"
7,20,38,"Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the men in ambush, that they should make a great flame with smoke to ascend up from the city."
7,20,39,"And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite"
7,20,40,"But when the flame began to ascend up from the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven."
7,20,41,"And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil had come upon them."
7,20,42,"Therefore they turned"
7,20,43,""
7,20,44,"And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these"
7,20,45,"And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them."
7,20,46,"So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these"
7,20,47,"But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months."
7,20,48,"And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of"
7,21,1,"Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin for a wife."
7,21,2,"And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept bitterly;"
7,21,3,"And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?"
7,21,4,"And it came to pass on the next morning, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings."
7,21,5,"And the children of Israel said, Who"
7,21,6,"And the children of Israel repented for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day."
7,21,7,"How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters for wives?"
7,21,8,"And they said, What one"
7,21,9,"For the people were numbered, and, behold,"
7,21,10,"And the congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children."
7,21,11,"And this"
7,21,12,"And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which"
7,21,13,"And the whole congregation sent"
7,21,14,"And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not."
7,21,15,"And the people repented for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel."
7,21,16,"Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?"
7,21,17,"And they said,"
7,21,18,"But we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed"
7,21,19,"Then they said, Behold,"
7,21,20,"Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;"
7,21,21,"And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin."
7,21,22,"And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to us to complain, that we will say to them, Be favourable to them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give to them at this time,"
7,21,23,"And the children of Benjamin did so, and took"
7,21,24,"And the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went from there every man to his inheritance."
7,21,25,"In those days"
8,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to dwell in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons."
8,1,2,"And the name of the man"
8,1,3,"And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons."
8,1,4,"And they took for themselves wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one"
8,1,5,"And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left without her two sons and her husband."
8,1,6,"Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them food."
8,1,7,"Therefore she went forth from the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah."
8,1,8,"And Naomi said to her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother’s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me."
8,1,9,"The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each"
8,1,10,"And they said to her, Surely we will return with thee to thy people."
8,1,11,"And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me?"
8,1,12,"Turn again, my daughters, go"
8,1,13,"Would ye wait for them till they should be grown? would ye restrain yourselves from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD hast gone out against me."
8,1,14,"And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clung to her."
8,1,15,"And she said, Behold, thy sister in law hath gone back to her people, and to her gods: return thou after thy sister in law."
8,1,16,"And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee,"
8,1,17,"Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also,"
8,1,18,"When she saw that she was steadfastly resolved to go with her, then she finished speaking to her."
8,1,19,"So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they had come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said,"
8,1,20,"And she said to them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me."
8,1,21,"I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why"
8,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, who returned from the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest."
8,2,1,"And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name"
8,2,2,"And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of grain after"
8,2,3,"And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she happened to come to a part of the field"
8,2,4,"And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, The LORD"
8,2,5,"Then said Boaz to his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel"
8,2,6,"And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It"
8,2,7,"And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house."
8,2,8,"Then said Boaz to Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from here, but abide here close by my maidens:"
8,2,9,""
8,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found grace in thy eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I"
8,2,11,"And Boaz answered and said to her, It hath fully been shown to me, all that thou hast done to thy mother in law since the death of thy husband: and"
8,2,12,"The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou hast come to trust."
8,2,13,"Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly to thy handmaid, though I am not like one of thy handmaidens."
8,2,14,"And Boaz said to her, At mealtime come thou here, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached for her roasted"
8,2,15,"And when she had risen to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:"
8,2,16,"And let fall also"
8,2,17,"So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out that which she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley."
8,2,18,"And she took"
8,2,19,"And her mother in law said to her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where hast thou laboured? blessed be he that took knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to day"
8,2,20,"And Naomi said to her daughter in law, Blessed"
8,2,21,"And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said to me also, Thou shalt keep close by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest."
8,2,22,"And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter in law,"
8,2,23,"So she kept close by the maidens of Boaz to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law."
8,3,1,"Then Naomi her mother in law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?"
8,3,2,"And now"
8,3,3,"Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and go down to the floor:"
8,3,4,"And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do."
8,3,5,"And she said to her, All that thou sayest to me I will do."
8,3,6,"And she went down to the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her."
8,3,7,"And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid herself down."
8,3,8,"And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet."
8,3,9,"And he said, Who"
8,3,10,"And he said, Blessed"
8,3,11,"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou"
8,3,12,"And now it is true that I"
8,3,13,"Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning,"
8,3,14,"And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came to the floor."
8,3,15,"Also he said, Bring the veil that"
8,3,16,"And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who"
8,3,17,"And she said, These six"
8,3,18,"Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou knowest how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he hath finished the thing this day."
8,4,1,"Then Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such an one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down."
8,4,2,"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down."
8,4,3,"And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, that hast come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which"
8,4,4,"And I thought to tell thee, saying, Buy"
8,4,5,"Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy"
8,4,6,"And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem"
8,4,7,"Now this"
8,4,8,"Therefore the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy"
8,4,9,"And Boaz said to the elders, and"
8,4,10,"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye"
8,4,11,"And all the people that"
8,4,12,"And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman."
8,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in to her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son."
8,4,14,"And the women said to Naomi, Blessed"
8,4,15,"And he shall be to thee a restorer of"
8,4,16,"And Naomi took the child, and laid him in her bosom, and became his nurse."
8,4,17,"And the women her neighbours gave him a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he"
8,4,18,"Now these"
8,4,19,"And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,"
8,4,20,"And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,"
8,4,21,"And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,"
8,4,22,"And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David."
9,1,1,"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name"
9,1,2,"And he had two wives; the name of the one"
9,1,3,"And this man went up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD,"
9,1,4,"And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:"
9,1,5,"But to Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had closed up her womb."
9,1,6,"And her adversary also provoked her greatly, to make her fret, because the LORD had closed up her womb."
9,1,7,"And"
9,1,8,"Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved?"
9,1,9,"So Hannah rose after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD."
9,1,10,"And she"
9,1,11,"And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give to thy handmaid a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head."
9,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli observed her mouth."
9,1,13,"Now Hannah, spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she was drunk."
9,1,14,"And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunk? put away thy wine from thee."
9,1,15,"And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I"
9,1,16,"Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I been speaking."
9,1,17,"Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant"
9,1,18,"And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and ate, and her countenance was no more"
9,1,19,"And they rose in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her."
9,1,20,"Therefore it came to pass, when the time had arrived after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel,"
9,1,21,"And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow."
9,1,22,"But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband,"
9,1,23,"And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seemeth to thee good; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and nursed her son until she weaned him."
9,1,24,"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child"
9,1,25,"And they slew a bull, and brought the child to Eli."
9,1,26,"And she said, O my lord,"
9,1,27,"For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:"
9,1,28,"Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there."
9,2,1,"And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation."
9,2,2,""
9,2,3,"Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let"
9,2,4,"The bows of the mighty men"
9,2,5,""
9,2,6,"The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up."
9,2,7,"The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up."
9,2,8,"He raiseth the poor out of the dust,"
9,2,9,"He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail."
9,2,10,"The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed."
9,2,11,"And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest."
9,2,12,"Now the sons of Eli"
9,2,13,"And the priests’ custom with the people"
9,2,14,"And he struck"
9,2,15,"Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw."
9,2,16,"And"
9,2,17,"Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD."
9,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before the LORD,"
9,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought"
9,2,20,"And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went to their own home."
9,2,21,"And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD."
9,2,22,"Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled"
9,2,23,"And he said to them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people."
9,2,24,"Nay, my sons; for"
9,2,25,"If one man shall sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man shall sin against the LORD, who shall plead for him? However they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them."
9,2,26,"And the child Samuel continued to grow, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men."
9,2,27,"And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?"
9,2,28,"And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel"
9,2,29,"Why trample ye at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded"
9,2,30,"Therefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed"
9,2,31,"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thy arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house."
9,2,32,"And thou shalt see an enemy"
9,2,33,"And the man of thine,"
9,2,34,"And this"
9,2,35,"And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest,"
9,2,36,"And it shall come to pass,"
9,3,1,"And the child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days;"
9,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli"
9,3,3,"And before the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God"
9,3,4,"That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here"
9,3,5,"And he ran to Eli, and said, Here"
9,3,6,"And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here"
9,3,7,"Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him."
9,3,8,"And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here"
9,3,9,"Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he should call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
9,3,10,"And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth."
9,3,11,"And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle."
9,3,12,"In that day I will perform against Eli all"
9,3,13,"For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not."
9,3,14,"And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever."
9,3,15,"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to tell Eli the vision."
9,3,16,"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here"
9,3,17,"And he said, What"
9,3,18,"And Samuel told him every thing, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It"
9,3,19,"And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground."
9,3,20,"And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel"
9,3,21,"And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD."
9,4,1,"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek."
9,4,2,"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men."
9,4,3,"And when the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh to us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us from the hand of our enemies."
9,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth"
9,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth shook."
9,4,6,"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What"
9,4,7,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God hath come into the camp. And they said, Woe to us! for there hath not been such a thing before."
9,4,8,"Woe to us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these"
9,4,9,"Be strong, and acquit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye may not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you: acquit yourselves like men, and fight."
9,4,10,"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen."
9,4,11,"And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain."
9,4,12,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn, and with earth upon his head."
9,4,13,"And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the way side watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told"
9,4,14,"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What"
9,4,15,"Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see."
9,4,16,"And the man said to Eli, I"
9,4,17,"And the messenger answered and said, Israel hath fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken."
9,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years."
9,4,19,"And his daughter in law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child,"
9,4,20,"And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said to her, Fear not; for thou hast borne a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard"
9,4,21,"And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory hath departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband."
9,4,22,"And she said, The glory hath departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken."
9,5,1,"And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod."
9,5,2,"When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon."
9,5,3,"And when they of Ashdod arose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon"
9,5,4,"And when they arose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon"
9,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day."
9,5,6,"But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with haemorrhoids,"
9,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod saw that"
9,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel"
9,5,9,"And it was"
9,5,10,"Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people."
9,5,11,"So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there."
9,5,12,"And the men that died not were smitten with the haemorrhoids: and the cry of the city went up to heaven."
9,6,1,"And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months."
9,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us how we shall send it to its place."
9,6,3,"And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but by all means return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you."
9,6,4,"Then said they, What"
9,6,5,"Therefore ye shall make images of your haemorrhoids, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory to the God of Israel: perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land."
9,6,6,"Why then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?"
9,6,7,"Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milk cows, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:"
9,6,8,"And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return to him"
9,6,9,"And see, if it goeth up by the way of its own land to Bethshemesh,"
9,6,10,"And the men did so; and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:"
9,6,11,"And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the box with the mice of gold and the images of their haemorrhoids."
9,6,12,"And the cows took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh,"
9,6,13,"And"
9,6,14,"And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where"
9,6,15,"And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the box that"
9,6,16,"And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen"
9,6,17,"And these"
9,6,18,"And the golden mice,"
9,6,19,"And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and seventy men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten"
9,6,20,"And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?"
9,6,21,"And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down,"
9,7,1,"And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and brought up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD."
9,7,2,"And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD."
9,7,3,"And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return to the LORD with all your hearts,"
9,7,4,"Then the children of Israel put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only."
9,7,5,"And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD."
9,7,6,"And they gathered together at Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured"
9,7,7,"And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard"
9,7,8,"And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry to the LORD our God for us, that he will save us from the hand of the Philistines."
9,7,9,"And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered"
9,7,10,"And as Samuel was offering the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and smote them; and they were smitten before Israel."
9,7,11,"And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until"
9,7,12,"Then Samuel took a stone, and set"
9,7,13,"So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the land of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel."
9,7,14,"And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and its land did Israel deliver from the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites."
9,7,15,"And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life."
9,7,16,"And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places."
9,7,17,"And his return"
9,8,1,"And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel."
9,8,2,"Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah:"
9,8,3,"And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after money, and took bribes, and perverted judgment."
9,8,4,"Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel to Ramah,"
9,8,5,"And said to him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations."
9,8,6,"But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed to the LORD."
9,8,7,"And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them."
9,8,8,"According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also to thee."
9,8,9,"Now therefore hearken to their voice: yet protest solemnly to them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them."
9,8,10,"And Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people that asked of him a king."
9,8,11,"And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint"
9,8,12,"And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and"
9,8,13,"And he will take your daughters"
9,8,14,"And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards,"
9,8,15,"And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants."
9,8,16,"And he will take your male servants, and your female servants, and your most choice young men, and your donkeys, and put"
9,8,17,"He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants."
9,8,18,"And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen for yourselves; and the LORD will not hear you in that day."
9,8,19,"Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;"
9,8,20,"That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles."
9,8,21,"And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he reported them in the ears of the LORD."
9,8,22,"And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken to their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go ye every man to his city."
9,9,1,"Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name"
9,9,2,"And he had a son, whose name"
9,9,3,"And the donkeys of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the donkeys."

9,9,9,"(In times past in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer: for"

9,9,26,"And they rose early: and it came to pass about the dawn of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Arise, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad."
9,9,27,""
9,10,1,"Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured"
9,10,2,"When thou hast departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to thee, The donkeys which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath stopped caring for the donkeys, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?"
9,10,3,"Then shalt thou go on forward from there, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:"

9,10,16,"And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he told him not."
9,10,17,"And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;"

9,14,34,"And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay"
9,14,35,"And Saul built an altar to the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built to the LORD."
9,14,36,"And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever seemeth good to thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near to God here."
9,14,37,"And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day."
9,14,38,"And Saul said, Come ye here, all the chief of the people: and know and see what this sin hath been this day."
9,14,39,"For,"
9,14,40,"Then said he to all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what seemeth good to thee."
9,14,41,"Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect"
9,14,42,"And Saul said, Cast"
9,14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that"
9,14,44,"And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan."
9,14,45,"And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? By no means:"
9,14,46,"Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place."
9,14,47,"So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he smote"
9,14,48,"And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of them that spoiled them."
9,14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters"
9,14,50,"And the name of Saul’s wife"
9,14,51,"And Kish"
9,14,52,"And there was a fierce war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him to himself."
9,15,1,"Samuel also said to Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee"
9,15,2,"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember"
9,15,3,"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey."
9,15,4,"And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah."
9,15,5,"And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley."
9,15,6,"And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, withdraw yourselves from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up from Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites."
9,15,7,"And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah"
9,15,8,"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword."
9,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all"
9,15,10,"Then came the word of the LORD to Samuel, saying,"
9,15,11,"I repent that I have set up Saul"
9,15,12,"And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and hast gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal."
9,15,13,"And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him, Blessed"
9,15,14,"And Samuel said, What"
9,15,15,"And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed."
9,15,16,"Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on."
9,15,17,"And Samuel said, When thou"
9,15,18,"And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed."
9,15,19,"Why then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?"
9,15,20,"And Saul said to Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites."
9,15,21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God in Gilgal."
9,15,22,"And Samuel said, Hath the LORD"
9,15,23,"For rebellion"
9,15,24,"And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice."
9,15,25,"Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD."
9,15,26,"And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel."
9,15,27,"And as Samuel turned about to depart, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it tore."
9,15,28,"And Samuel said to him, The LORD hath torn the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine,"
9,15,29,"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he"
9,15,30,"Then he said, I have sinned:"
9,15,31,"So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD."
9,15,32,"Then said Samuel, Bring ye here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past."
9,15,33,"And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal."
9,15,34,"Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul."
9,15,35,"And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel."
9,16,1,"And the LORD said to Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons."
9,16,2,"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul shall hear"
9,16,3,"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint to me"
9,16,4,"And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?"
9,16,5,"And he said, Peaceably: I have come to sacrifice to the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice."
9,16,6,"And it came to pass, when they had come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD’S anointed"
9,16,7,"But the LORD said to Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for"
9,16,8,"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this."
9,16,9,"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this."
9,16,10,"Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these."
9,16,11,"And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all"
9,16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he"
9,16,13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day onward. So Samuel arose, and went to Ramah."
9,16,14,"But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him."
9,16,15,"And Saul’s servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee."
9,16,16,"Let our lord now command thy servants,"
9,16,17,"And Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring"
9,16,18,"Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite,"
9,16,19,"Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send to me David thy son, who"
9,16,20,"And Jesse took a donkey"
9,16,21,"And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer."
9,16,22,"And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight."
9,16,23,"And it came to pass, when the"
9,17,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which"
9,17,2,"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped by the valley of Elah, and they set the battle in array against the Philistines."
9,17,3,"And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and"
9,17,4,"And there went out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height"
9,17,5,"And"
9,17,6,"And"
9,17,7,"And the staff of his spear"
9,17,8,"And he stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why have ye come out to set"
9,17,9,"If he shall be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I shall prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us."
9,17,10,"And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together."
9,17,11,"When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid."
9,17,12,"Now David"
9,17,13,"And the three eldest sons of Jesse went"
9,17,14,"And David"
9,17,15,"But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem."
9,17,16,"And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days."
9,17,17,"And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this roasted"
9,17,18,"And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of"
9,17,19,"Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel,"
9,17,20,"And David rose early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle."
9,17,21,"For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army."
9,17,22,"And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran into the army, and came and greeted his brethren."
9,17,23,"And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, from the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard"
9,17,24,"And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were exceedingly afraid."
9,17,25,"And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that hath come up? surely to defy Israel hath he come: and it shall be,"
9,17,26,"And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who"
9,17,27,"And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him."
9,17,28,"And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down here? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mayest see the battle."
9,17,29,"And David said, What have I now done?"
9,17,30,"And he turned from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner."
9,17,31,"And when the words were heard which David spoke, they reported"
9,17,32,"And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine."
9,17,33,"And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou"
9,17,34,"And David said to Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:"
9,17,35,"And I went after him, and smote him, and delivered"
9,17,36,"Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God."
9,17,37,"David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and the LORD be with thee."
9,17,38,"And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail."
9,17,39,"And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he tried to go; for he had not proved"
9,17,40,"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a bag; and his sling"
9,17,41,"And the Philistine advanced and drew near to David; and the man that bore the shield"
9,17,42,"And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance."
9,17,43,"And the Philistine said to David,"
9,17,44,"And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field."
9,17,45,"Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied."
9,17,46,"This day will the LORD deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from thee; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel."
9,17,47,"And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle"
9,17,48,"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine."
9,17,49,"And David put his hand in his bag, and took from there a stone, and slung it with his sling, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth."
9,17,50,"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but"
9,17,51,"Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled."
9,17,52,"And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, to the entrance of the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron."
9,17,53,"And the children of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their tents."
9,17,54,"And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent."
9,17,55,"And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son"
9,17,56,"And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling"
9,17,57,"And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand."
9,17,58,"And Saul said to him, Whose son"
9,18,1,"And it came to pass, when he had finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul."
9,18,2,"And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house."
9,18,3,"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul."
9,18,4,"And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that"
9,18,5,"And David went out wherever Saul sent him,"
9,18,6,"And it came to pass as they came, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music."
9,18,7,"And the women spoke to"
9,18,8,"And Saul was very angry, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands: and"
9,18,9,"And Saul kept a jealous eye on David from that day and onward."
9,18,10,"And it came to pass on the next day, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and"
9,18,11,"And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David escaped from his presence twice."
9,18,12,"And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and had departed from Saul."
9,18,13,"Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people."
9,18,14,"And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD"
9,18,15,"Therefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him."
9,18,16,"But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them."
9,18,17,"And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee for a wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD’S battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him."
9,18,18,"And David said to Saul, Who"
9,18,19,"But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife."
9,18,20,"And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him."
9,18,21,"And Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in"
9,18,22,"And Saul commanded his servants,"
9,18,23,"And Saul’s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you"
9,18,24,"And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David."
9,18,25,"And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines."
9,18,26,"And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son in law: and the days had not expired."
9,18,27,"Therefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king’s son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter for a wife."
9,18,28,"And Saul saw and knew that the LORD"
9,18,29,"And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David’s enemy continually."
9,18,30,"Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth,"
9,19,1,"And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David."
9,19,2,"But Jonathan Saul’s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret"
9,19,3,"And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou"
9,19,4,"And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works"
9,19,5,"For he put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest"
9,19,6,"And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore,"
9,19,7,"And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past."
9,19,8,"And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him."
9,19,9,"And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with"
9,19,10,"And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away from Saul’s presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night."
9,19,11,"Saul also sent messengers to David’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David’s wife told him, saying, If thou dost not save thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain."
9,19,12,"So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped."
9,19,13,"And Michal took an image, and laid"
9,19,14,"And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He"
9,19,15,"And Saul sent the messengers"
9,19,16,"And when the messengers had come in, behold,"
9,19,17,"And Saul said to Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away my enemy, that he hast escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?"
9,19,18,"So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth."
9,19,19,"And it was told to Saul, saying, Behold, David"
9,19,20,"And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing"
9,19,21,"And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also."
9,19,22,"Then he went also to Ramah, and came to a great well that"
9,19,23,"And he went there to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,24,"And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say,"
9,20,1,"And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what"
9,20,2,"And he said to him, Far be it from thee; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show it to me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it"
9,20,3,"And David swore moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thy eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he should be grieved: but truly"
9,20,4,"Then said Jonathan to David, Whatever thy soul desireth, I will even do"
9,20,5,"And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to morrow"
9,20,6,"If thy father shall at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked"
9,20,7,"If he shall say thus,"
9,20,8,"Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: however, if there is in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?"
9,20,9,"And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil is determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?"
9,20,10,"Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what"
9,20,11,"And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field."
9,20,12,"And Jonathan said to David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time,"
9,20,13,"The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it shall please my father"
9,20,14,"And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the LORD, that I may not die:"
9,20,15,"But"
9,20,16,"So Jonathan made"
9,20,17,"And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul."
9,20,18,"Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow"
9,20,19,"And"
9,20,20,"And I will shoot three arrows on the side"
9,20,21,"And, behold, I will send a lad,"
9,20,22,"But if I say thus to the young man, Behold, the arrows"
9,20,23,"And"
9,20,24,"So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon had come, the king sat down to eat food."
9,20,25,"And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times,"
9,20,26,"Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he"
9,20,27,"And it came to pass on the next day,"
9,20,28,"And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked"
9,20,29,"And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me"
9,20,30,"Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious"
9,20,31,"For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die."
9,20,32,"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why shall he be slain? what hath he done?"
9,20,33,"And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to slay David."
9,20,34,"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame."
9,20,35,"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him."
9,20,36,"And he said to his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot."
9,20,37,"And when the lad had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said,"
9,20,38,"And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master."
9,20,39,"But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter."
9,20,40,"And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry"
9,20,41,""
9,20,42,"And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city."
9,21,1,"Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said to him, Why"
9,21,2,"And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said to me, Let no man know any thing of the business about which I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed"
9,21,3,"Now therefore what is under thy hand? give"
9,21,4,"And the priest answered David, and said,"
9,21,5,"And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women"
9,21,6,"So the priest gave him hallowed"
9,21,7,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul"
9,21,8,"And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand a spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste."
9,21,9,"And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it"
9,21,10,"And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath."
9,21,11,"And the servants of Achish said to him,"
9,21,12,"And David laid up these words in his heart, and was greatly afraid of Achish the king of Gath."
9,21,13,"And he changed his behaviour before them, and pretended to be mad in their hands, and made marks on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard."
9,21,14,"Then said Achish to his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: why"
9,21,15,"Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this"
9,22,1,"David therefore departed from there, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard"
9,22,2,"And every one"
9,22,3,"And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth,"
9,22,4,"And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the strong hold."
9,22,5,"And the prophet Gad said to David, Abide not in the strong hold; depart, and come into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth."
9,22,6,"When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that"
9,22,7,"Then Saul said to his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give each one of you fields and vineyards,"
9,22,8,"That all of you have conspired against me, and"
9,22,9,"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub."
9,22,10,"And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him food, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
9,22,11,"Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that"
9,22,12,"And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I"
9,22,13,"And Saul said to him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
9,22,14,"Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who"
9,22,15,"Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute"
9,22,16,"And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father’s house."
9,22,17,"And the king said to the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also"
9,22,18,"And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day eighty and five persons that wore a linen ephod."
9,22,19,"And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and donkeys, and sheep, with the edge of the sword."
9,22,20,"And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David."
9,22,21,"And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the LORD’S priests."
9,22,22,"And David said to Abiathar, I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite"
9,22,23,"Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou"
9,23,1,"Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors."
9,23,2,"Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said to David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah."
9,23,3,"And David’s men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?"
9,23,4,"Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand."
9,23,5,"So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah."
9,23,6,"And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah,"
9,23,7,"And it was told to Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars."
9,23,8,"And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men."
9,23,9,"And David knew that Saul secretly devised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod."
9,23,10,"Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake."
9,23,11,"Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down."
9,23,12,"Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver"
9,23,13,"Then David and his men,"
9,23,14,"And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand."
9,23,15,"And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life: and David"
9,23,16,"And Jonathan Saul’s son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God."
9,23,17,"And he said to him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next to thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth."
9,23,18,"And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house."
9,23,19,"Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which"
9,23,20,"Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part"
9,23,21,"And Saul said, Blessed"
9,23,22,"Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is,"
9,23,23,"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he is in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah."
9,23,24,"And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men"
9,23,25,"Saul also and his men went to seek"
9,23,26,"And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men on all sides to take them."
9,23,27,"But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land."
9,23,28,"Therefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth."
9,23,29,"Then David went up from there, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi."
9,24,1,"And it came to pass, when Saul had returned from following the Philistines, that it was told to him, saying, Behold, David"
9,24,2,"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats."
9,24,3,"And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where"
9,24,4,"And the men of David said to him, Behold the day of which the LORD said to thee, Behold, I will deliver thy enemy into thy hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good to thee. Then David arose, and secretly cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe."
9,24,5,"And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt."
9,24,6,"And he said to his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the LORD’S anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he"
9,24,7,"So David restrained his servants with these words, and permitted them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose out of the cave, and went on"
9,24,8,"David also rose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself."
9,24,9,"And David said to Saul, Why hearest thou men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy harm?"
9,24,10,"Behold, this day thy eyes have seen how the LORD hath delivered thee to day into my hand in the cave: and"
9,24,11,"Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that"
9,24,12,"The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but my hand shall not be upon thee."
9,24,13,"As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but my hand shall not be upon thee."
9,24,14,"After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea."
9,24,15,"The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand."
9,24,16,"And it came to pass, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said,"
9,24,17,"And he said to David, Thou"
9,24,18,"And thou hast showed this day how thou hast dealt with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thy hand, thou didst not kill me."
9,24,19,"For if a man findeth his enemy, will he let him go away well? therefore the LORD reward thee with good for what thou hast done to me this day."
9,24,20,"And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand."
9,24,21,"Swear now therefore to me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house."
9,24,22,"And David swore to Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men went up to the strong hold."
9,25,1,"And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran."
9,25,2,"And"
9,25,3,"Now the name of the man"
9,25,4,"And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep."
9,25,5,"And David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:"
9,25,6,"And thus shall ye say to him that liveth"
9,25,7,"And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds who were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there any thing missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel."
9,25,8,"Ask thy young men, and they will show thee. Therefore let the young men find favour in thy eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatever cometh to thy hand to thy servants, and to thy son David."
9,25,9,"And when David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal in the name of David, according to all these words, and ceased."
9,25,10,"And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who"
9,25,11,"Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give"
9,25,12,"So David’s young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all these sayings."
9,25,13,"And David said to his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage."
9,25,14,"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master; and he railed at them."
9,25,15,"But the men"
9,25,16,"They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep."
9,25,17,"Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he"
9,25,18,"Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of roasted"
9,25,19,"And she said to her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal."
9,25,20,"And it was"
9,25,21,"Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this"
9,25,22,"So and more also do God to the enemies of David, if I leave of all that"
9,25,23,"And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and got off the donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,"
9,25,24,"And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord,"
9,25,25,"Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this worthless man,"
9,25,26,"Now therefore, my lord,"
9,25,27,"And now this blessing which thy handmaid hath brought to my lord, let it even be given to the young men that follow my lord."
9,25,28,"I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thy handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee"
9,25,29,"Yet a man hath risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thy enemies, them shall he sling out,"
9,25,30,"And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;"
9,25,31,"That this shall be no grief to thee, nor offence of heart to my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid."
9,25,32,"And David said to Abigail, Blessed"
9,25,33,"And blessed"
9,25,34,"For in very deed,"
9,25,35,"So David received from her hand"
9,25,36,"And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart"
9,25,37,"But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine had left Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became"
9,25,38,"And it came to pass about ten days"
9,25,39,"And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed"
9,25,40,"And when the servants of David had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, David hath sent us to thee, to take thee to him for a wife."
9,25,41,"And she arose, and bowed herself on"
9,25,42,"And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon a donkey, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife."
9,25,43,"David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives."
9,25,44,"But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, who"
9,26,1,"And the Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah,"
9,26,2,"Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph."
9,26,3,"And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which"
9,26,4,"David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had come in very deed."
9,26,5,"And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people encamped around him."
9,26,6,"Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee."
9,26,7,"So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his head: but Abner and the people lay about him."
9,26,8,"Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thy enemy into thy hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not"
9,26,9,"And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD’S anointed, and be guiltless?"
9,26,10,"David said furthermore,"
9,26,11,"The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the LORD’S anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that"
9,26,12,"So David took the spear and the cruse of water from"
9,26,13,"Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space"
9,26,14,"And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who"
9,26,15,"And David said to Abner,"
9,26,16,"This thing"
9,26,17,"And Saul knew David’s voice, and said,"
9,26,18,"And he said, Why doth my lord thus pursue his servant? for what have I done? or what evil"
9,26,19,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD hath stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if"
9,26,20,"Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel hath come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains."
9,26,21,"Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thy eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly."
9,26,22,"And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let one of the young men come over and take it."
9,26,23,"The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into"
9,26,24,"And, behold, as thy life was precious this day in my eyes, so let my life be precious in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation."
9,26,25,"Then Saul said to David, Blessed"
9,27,1,"And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul:"
9,27,2,"And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that"
9,27,3,"And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household,"
9,27,4,"And it was told to Saul that David had fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him."
9,27,5,"And David said to Achish, If I have now found grace in thy eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?"
9,27,6,"Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: therefore Ziklag pertaineth to the kings of Judah to this day."
9,27,7,"And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months."
9,27,8,"And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those"
9,27,9,"And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the donkeys, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish."
9,27,10,"And Achish said, Where have ye plundered to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites."
9,27,11,"And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring"
9,27,12,"And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever."
9,28,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said to David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men."
9,28,2,"And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of my head for ever."
9,28,3,"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that were mediums, and the wizards, out of the land."
9,28,4,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa."
9,28,5,"And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled."
9,28,6,"And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets."
9,28,7,"Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman that is a medium, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold,"
9,28,8,"And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine to me as a medium, and bring up for me, whom I shall name to thee."
9,28,9,"And the woman said to him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that are mediums, and the wizards, out of the land: Why then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?"
9,28,10,"And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying,"
9,28,11,"Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel."
9,28,12,"And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou"
9,28,13,"And the king said to her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth."
9,28,14,"And he said to her, What is his form? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he"
9,28,15,"And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am grievously distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God hath departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known to me what I shall do."
9,28,16,"Then said Samuel, Why then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD hath departed from thee, and hath become thy enemy?"
9,28,17,"And the LORD hath done to him, as he spoke by me: for the LORD hath torn the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbour,"
9,28,18,"Because thou didst not obey the voice of the LORD, nor execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing to thee this day."
9,28,19,"Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow"
9,28,20,"Then Saul fell immediately all along on the earth, and was exceedingly afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night."
9,28,21,"And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was greatly troubled, and said to him, Behold, thy handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened to thy words which thou spoke to me."
9,28,22,"Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also to the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way."
9,28,23,"But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened to their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed."
9,28,24,"And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded"
9,28,25,"And she brought"
9,29,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by a fountain which"
9,29,2,"And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish."
9,29,3,"Then said the princes of the Philistines, What"
9,29,4,"And the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he should be an adversary to us: for how should he reconcile himself to his master?"
9,29,5,""
9,29,6,"Then Achish called David, and said to him, Surely,"
9,29,7,"Therefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines."
9,29,8,"And David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
9,29,9,"And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou"
9,29,10,"Therefore now rise early in the morning with thy master’s servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye shall have risen early in the morning, and have light, depart."
9,29,11,"So David and his men rose early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel."
9,30,1,"And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;"
9,30,2,"And had taken the women captives, that"
9,30,3,"So David and his men came to the city, and, behold,"
9,30,4,"Then David and the people that"
9,30,5,"And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite."
9,30,6,"And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God."
9,30,7,"And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray thee, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought there the ephod to David."
9,30,8,"And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake"
9,30,9,"So David went, he and the six hundred men that"
9,30,10,"But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor."
9,30,11,"And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they made him drink water;"
9,30,12,"And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk"
9,30,13,"And David said to him, To whom"
9,30,14,"We made an invasion"
9,30,15,"And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear to me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company."
9,30,16,"And when he had brought him down, behold,"
9,30,17,"And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, except four hundred young men, who rode upon camels, and fled."
9,30,18,"And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives."
9,30,19,"And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any"
9,30,20,"And David took all the flocks and the herds,"
9,30,21,"And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that"
9,30,22,"Then answered all the wicked and worthless men, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them"
9,30,23,"Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand."
9,30,24,"For who will hearken to you in this matter? but as his part"
9,30,25,"And it was"
9,30,26,"And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah,"
9,30,27,"To"
9,30,28,"And to"
9,30,29,"And to"
9,30,30,"And to"
9,30,31,"And to"
9,31,1,"Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa."
9,31,2,"And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul’s sons."
9,31,3,"And the battle went heavily against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was grievously wounded by the archers."
9,31,4,"Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through with it; lest these uncircumcised should come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was exceedingly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it."
9,31,5,"And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him."
9,31,6,"So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together."
9,31,7,"And when the men of Israel that"
9,31,8,"And it came to pass on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa."
9,31,9,"And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent"
9,31,10,"And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan."
9,31,11,"And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;"
9,31,12,"All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there."
9,31,13,"And they took their bones, and buried"
10,1,1,"Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;"
10,1,2,"It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes torn, and earth upon his head: and"
10,1,3,"And David said to him, From where comest thou? And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel have I escaped."
10,1,4,"And David said to him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also."
10,1,5,"And David said to the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?"
10,1,6,"And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him."
10,1,7,"And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here"
10,1,8,"And he said to me, Who"
10,1,9,"He said to me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life"
10,1,10,"So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen: and I took the crown that"
10,1,11,"Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men that"
10,1,12,"And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they had fallen by the sword."
10,1,13,"And David said to the young man that told him, From where"
10,1,14,"And David said to him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thy hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?"
10,1,15,"And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near,"
10,1,16,"And David said to him, Thy blood"
10,1,17,"And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:"
10,1,18,"(Also he told them to teach the children of Judah"
10,1,19,"Thy glory, O Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!"
10,1,20,"Tell"
10,1,21,"Ye mountains of Gilboa,"
10,1,22,"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty."
10,1,23,"Saul and Jonathan"
10,1,24,"Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with"
10,1,25,"How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,"
10,1,26,"I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been to me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women."
10,1,27,"How have the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!"
10,2,1,"And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said to him, Go up. And David said, Where shall I go up? And he said, To Hebron."
10,2,2,"So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal’s wife the Carmelite."
10,2,3,"And his men that"
10,2,4,"And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying,"
10,2,5,"And David sent messengers to the men of Jabeshgilead, and said to them, Blessed"
10,2,6,"And now the LORD show kindness and truth to you: and I also will repay you this kindness, because ye have done this thing."
10,2,7,"Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them."
10,2,8,"But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;"
10,2,9,"And he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel."
10,2,10,"Ishbosheth Saul’s son"
10,2,11,"And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months."
10,2,12,"And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon."
10,2,13,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool."
10,2,14,"And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and fight before us. And Joab said, Let them arise."
10,2,15,"Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, who"
10,2,16,"And they caught every one his opponent by the head, and"
10,2,17,"And there was a very fierce battle that day; and Abner was smitten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David."
10,2,18,"And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel"
10,2,19,"And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner."
10,2,20,"Then Abner looked behind him, and said,"
10,2,21,"And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay hold on one of the young men, and take to thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him."
10,2,22,"And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: why should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?"
10,2,23,"But he refused to turn aside: therefore Abner with the blunt end of the spear smote him under the fifth"
10,2,24,"Joab also and Abishai pursued Abner: and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that"
10,2,25,"And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill."
10,2,26,"Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, before thou wilt bid the people return from following their brethren?"
10,2,27,"And Joab said,"
10,2,28,"So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued Israel no more, neither fought they any more."
10,2,29,"And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim."
10,2,30,"And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel."
10,2,31,"But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s men,"
10,2,32,"And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which"
10,3,1,"Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul became weaker and weaker."
10,3,2,"And to David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;"
10,3,3,"And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;"
10,3,4,"And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;"
10,3,5,"And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron."
10,3,6,"And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul."
10,3,7,"And Saul had a concubine, whose name"
10,3,8,"Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said,"
10,3,9,"So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;"
10,3,10,"To pass on the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba."
10,3,11,"And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him."
10,3,12,"And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose"
10,3,13,"And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou shalt first bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face."
10,3,14,"And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul’s son, saying, Deliver to"
10,3,15,"And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from"
10,3,16,"And her husband went with her weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return. And he returned."
10,3,17,"And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past"
10,3,18,"Now then do"
10,3,19,"And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin."
10,3,20,"So Abner came to David in Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that"
10,3,21,"And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace."
10,3,22,"And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from"
10,3,23,"When Joab and all the host that"
10,3,24,"Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came to thee; why"
10,3,25,"Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest."
10,3,26,"And when Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew"
10,3,27,"And when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth"
10,3,28,"And afterward when David heard"
10,3,29,"Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house; and let there never cease from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread."
10,3,30,"So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle."
10,3,31,"And David said to Joab, and to all the people that"
10,3,32,"And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept."
10,3,33,"And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?"
10,3,34,"Thy hands"
10,3,35,"And when all the people came to cause David to eat food while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or any thing else, till the sun is down."
10,3,36,"And all the people took notice"
10,3,37,"For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner."
10,3,38,"And the king said to his servants, Know ye not that there hath a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?"
10,3,39,"And I"
10,4,1,"And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled."
10,4,2,"And Saul’s son had two men"
10,4,3,"And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day.)"
10,4,4,"And Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son"
10,4,5,"And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon."
10,4,6,"And they came there into the midst of the house,"
10,4,7,"For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went away through the plain all night."
10,4,8,"And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thy enemy, who sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed."
10,4,9,"And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them,"
10,4,10,"When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who"
10,4,11,"How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?"
10,4,12,"And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged"
10,5,1,"Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we"
10,5,2,"Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel."
10,5,3,"So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel."
10,5,4,"David"
10,5,5,"In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah."
10,5,6,"And the king and his men went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: who spoke to David, saying, Except thou shalt take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in here: thinking, David cannot come in there."
10,5,7,"Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same"
10,5,8,"And David said on that day, Whoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind,"
10,5,9,"So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built around from Millo and inward."
10,5,10,"And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts"
10,5,11,"And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house."
10,5,12,"And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake."
10,5,13,"And David took more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David."
10,5,14,"And these"
10,5,15,"Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,"
10,5,16,"And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet."
10,5,17,"But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard"
10,5,18,"The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim."
10,5,19,"And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said to David, Go up: for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand."
10,5,20,"And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon my enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim."
10,5,21,"And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them."
10,5,22,"And the Philistines came yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim."
10,5,23,"And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up;"
10,5,24,"And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines."
10,5,25,"And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou comest to Gazer."
10,6,1,"Again, David gathered together all"
10,6,2,"And David arose, and went with all the people that"
10,6,3,"And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that"
10,6,4,"And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which"
10,6,5,"And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of"
10,6,6,"And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth"
10,6,7,"And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for"
10,6,8,"And David was displeased, because the LORD had broken forth"
10,6,9,"And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?"
10,6,10,"So David would not remove the ark of the LORD to him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite."
10,6,11,"And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household."
10,6,12,"And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that"
10,6,13,"And it was"
10,6,14,"And David danced before the LORD with all"
10,6,15,"So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet."
10,6,16,"And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul’s daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart."
10,6,17,"And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place, inside the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD."
10,6,18,"And as soon as David had finished offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts."
10,6,19,"And he distributed among all the people,"
10,6,20,"Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the foolish fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!"
10,6,21,"And David said to Michal,"
10,6,22,"And I will yet be more contemptible than this, and will be base in my own sight: and by the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, by them shall I be had in honour."
10,6,23,"Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child until the day of her death."
10,7,1,"And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest on every side from all his enemies;"
10,7,2,"That the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains."
10,7,3,"And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that"
10,7,4,"And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,"
10,7,5,"Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?"
10,7,6,"Though I have not dwelt in"
10,7,7,"In all"
10,7,8,"Now therefore so shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:"
10,7,9,"And I was with thee wherever thou wentest, and have cut off all thy enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like the name of the great"
10,7,10,"Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as in times past,"
10,7,11,"And as since the time that I commanded judges"
10,7,12,"And when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall proceed out of thy own body, and I will establish his kingdom."
10,7,13,"He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever."
10,7,14,"I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he shall commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:"
10,7,15,"But my mercy shall not depart from him, as I took"
10,7,16,"And thy house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever."
10,7,17,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David."
10,7,18,"Then king David went in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who"
10,7,19,"And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come. And"
10,7,20,"And what can David say more to thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant."
10,7,21,"For thy word’s sake, and according to thy own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know"
10,7,22,"Therefore thou art great, O LORD God: for"
10,7,23,"And what one nation in the earth"
10,7,24,"For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel"
10,7,25,"And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish"
10,7,26,"And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts"
10,7,27,"For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer to thee."
10,7,28,"And now, O Lord GOD, thou"
10,7,29,"Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken"
10,8,1,"And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines."
10,8,2,"And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines he measured to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And"
10,8,3,"David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates."
10,8,4,"And David took from him a thousand"
10,8,5,"And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men."
10,8,6,"Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David,"
10,8,7,"And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem."
10,8,8,"And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took very much brass."
10,8,9,"When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,"
10,8,10,"Then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And"
10,8,11,"Which also king David dedicated to the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;"
10,8,12,"Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah."
10,8,13,"And David made"
10,8,14,"And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom he put garrisons, and all they of Edom became David’s servants. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went."
10,8,15,"And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice to all his people."
10,8,16,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah"
10,8,17,"And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar,"
10,8,18,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada"
10,9,1,"And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?"
10,9,2,"And"
10,9,3,"And the king said,"
10,9,4,"And the king said to him, Where"
10,9,5,"Then king David sent, and brought him from the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar."
10,9,6,"Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, had come to David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!"
10,9,7,"And David said to him, Fear not: for I will surely show thee kindness for the sake of Jonathan thy father, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually."
10,9,8,"And he bowed himself, and said, What"
10,9,9,"Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, I have given to thy master’s son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house."
10,9,10,"Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in"
10,9,11,"Then said Ziba to the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth,"
10,9,12,"And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name"
10,9,13,"So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he ate continually at the king’s table; and was lame in both his feet."
10,10,1,"And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead."
10,10,2,"Then said David, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon."
10,10,3,"And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters to thee? hath not David"
10,10,4,"Therefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle,"
10,10,5,"When they told"
10,10,6,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men."
10,10,7,"And when David heard of"
10,10,8,"And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah,"
10,10,9,"When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice"
10,10,10,"And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put"
10,10,11,"And he said, If the Syrians shall be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon shall be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee."
10,10,12,"Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good."
10,10,13,"And Joab and the people that"
10,10,14,"And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem."
10,10,15,"And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together."
10,10,16,"And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that"
10,10,17,"And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him."
10,10,18,"And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew"
10,10,19,"And when all the kings"
10,11,1,"And it came to pass, after the year had ended, at the time when kings go forth"
10,11,2,"And it came to pass in an evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman"
10,11,3,"And David sent and enquired after the woman. And"
10,11,4,"And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned to her house."
10,11,5,"And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I"
10,11,6,"And David sent to Joab,"
10,11,7,"And when Uriah had come to him, David enquired"
10,11,8,"And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a present from the king."
10,11,9,"But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house."
10,11,10,"And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down to his house, David said to Uriah, Camest thou not from"
10,11,11,"And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife?"
10,11,12,"And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the next."
10,11,13,"And when David had called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk: and at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house."
10,11,14,"And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent"
10,11,15,"And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the front line of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die."
10,11,16,"And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew that valiant men"
10,11,17,"And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell"
10,11,18,"Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;"
10,11,19,"And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast finished telling the matters of the war to the king,"
10,11,20,"And if the king’s wrath shall rise, and he shall say to thee, Why approached ye so near to the city for the fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?"
10,11,21,"Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye near the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
10,11,22,"So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for."
10,11,23,"And the messenger said to David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were upon them even to the entrance of the gate."
10,11,24,"And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and"
10,11,25,"Then David said to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him."
10,11,26,"And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband."
10,11,27,"And when the mourning was past, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD."
10,12,1,"And the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor."
10,12,2,"The rich"
10,12,3,"But the poor"
10,12,4,"And there came a traveller to the rich man, and he was not willing to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to prepare for the wayfaring man that had come to him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and prepared it for the man that had come to him."
10,12,5,"And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan,"
10,12,6,"And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity."
10,12,7,"And Nathan said to David, Thou"
10,12,8,"And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if"
10,12,9,"Why hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife"
10,12,10,"Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife."
10,12,11,"Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thy own house, and I will take thy wives before thy eyes, and give"
10,12,12,"For thou didst"
10,12,13,"And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said to David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die."
10,12,14,"But, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also"
10,12,15,"And Nathan departed to his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and he was very sick."
10,12,16,"David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth."
10,12,17,"And the elders of his house arose,"
10,12,18,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice: how will he then be grieved, if we tell him that the child is dead?"
10,12,19,"But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead."
10,12,20,"Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed"
10,12,21,"Then said his servants to him, What thing"
10,12,22,"And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell"
10,12,23,"But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me."
10,12,24,"And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him."
10,12,25,"And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD."
10,12,26,"And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city."
10,12,27,"And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters."
10,12,28,"Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name."
10,12,29,"And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it."
10,12,30,"And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight of which"
10,12,31,"And he brought forth the people that"
10,13,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name"
10,13,2,"And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she"
10,13,3,"But Amnon had a friend, whose name"
10,13,4,"And he said to him, Why"
10,13,5,"And Jonadab said to him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and pretend that thou art sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say to him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see"
10,13,6,"So Amnon lay down, and pretended that he was sick: and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make for me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand."
10,13,7,"Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and prepare a meal for him."
10,13,8,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded"
10,13,9,"And she took a pan, and poured"
10,13,10,"And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought"
10,13,11,"And when she had brought"
10,13,12,"And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly."
10,13,13,"And I, where shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from thee."
10,13,14,"However he would not hearken to her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her."
10,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred with which he hated her"
10,13,16,"And she said to him,"
10,13,17,"Then he called his servant that ministered to him, and said, Put now this"
10,13,18,"And"
10,13,19,"And Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of"
10,13,20,"And Absalom her brother said to her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he"
10,13,21,"But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry."
10,13,22,"And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar."
10,13,23,"And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which"
10,13,24,"And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant."
10,13,25,"And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be burdensome to thee. And he pressed him: yet he would not go, but blessed him."
10,13,26,"Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee?"
10,13,27,"But Absalom pressed him, that he should let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him."
10,13,28,"Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have I not commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant."
10,13,29,"And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man rode upon his mule, and fled."
10,13,30,"And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the report came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left."
10,13,31,"Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn."
10,13,32,"And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose"
10,13,33,"Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead."
10,13,34,"But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came many people by the way of the hill side behind him."
10,13,35,"And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as thy servant said, so it is."
10,13,36,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had finished speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept exceedingly."
10,13,37,"But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And"
10,13,38,"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years."
10,13,39,"And"
10,14,1,"Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart"
10,14,2,"And Joab sent to Tekoah, and brought from there a wise woman, and said to her, I pray thee, pretend to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:"
10,14,3,"And come to the king, and speak in this manner to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth."
10,14,4,"And when the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king."
10,14,5,"And the king said to her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I"
10,14,6,"And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and"
10,14,7,"And, behold, the whole family hath risen against thy handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband"
10,14,8,"And the king said to the woman, Go to thy house, and I will issue an order concerning thee."
10,14,9,"And the woman of Tekoah said to the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity"
10,14,10,"And the king said, Whoever saith"
10,14,11,"Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not permit the avenger of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said,"
10,14,12,"Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak"
10,14,13,"And the woman said, Why then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one who is faulty, in that the king doth not bring home again his banished."
10,14,14,"For we must needs die, and"
10,14,15,"Now therefore that I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king,"
10,14,16,"For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid from the hand of the man"
10,14,17,"Then thy handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comforting: for as an angel of God, so"
10,14,18,"Then the king answered and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak."
10,14,19,"And the king said,"
10,14,20,"To bring about this change of affairs hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord"
10,14,21,"And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again."
10,14,22,"And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant."
10,14,23,"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem."
10,14,24,"And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face."
10,14,25,"But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him."
10,14,26,"And when he cut"
10,14,27,"And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name"
10,14,28,"So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king’s face."
10,14,29,"Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, that he might send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come."
10,14,30,"Therefore he said to his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire."
10,14,31,"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to"
10,14,32,"And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying, Come here, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Why am I come from Geshur?"
10,14,33,"So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom."
10,15,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him."
10,15,2,"And Absalom rose early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was"
10,15,3,"And Absalom said to him, See, thy matters"
10,15,4,"Absalom said moreover, O that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!"
10,15,5,"And it was"
10,15,6,"And in this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel."
10,15,7,"And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said to the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron."
10,15,8,"For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD."
10,15,9,"And the king said to him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron."
10,15,10,"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron."
10,15,11,"And with Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem,"
10,15,12,"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city,"
10,15,13,"And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom."
10,15,14,"And David said to all his servants that"
10,15,15,"And the king’s servants said to the king, Behold, thy servants"
10,15,16,"And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women,"
10,15,17,"And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off."
10,15,18,"And all his servants passed on by his side; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king."
10,15,19,"Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou"
10,15,20,"Though thou camest"
10,15,21,"And Ittai answered the king, and said,"
10,15,22,"And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that"
10,15,23,"And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness."
10,15,24,"And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites"
10,15,25,"And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me"
10,15,26,"But if he shall thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold,"
10,15,27,"The king said also to Zadok the priest,"
10,15,28,"See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until word shall come from you to inform me."
10,15,29,"Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there."
10,15,30,"And David went up by the ascent of"
10,15,31,"And"
10,15,32,"And it came to pass, that"
10,15,33,"To whom David said, If thou shalt pass on with me, then thou shalt be a burden to me:"
10,15,34,"But if thou shalt return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king;"
10,15,35,"And"
10,15,36,"Behold,"
10,15,37,"So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem."
10,16,1,"And when David was a little past the top"
10,16,2,"And the king said to Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The donkeys"
10,16,3,"And the king said, And where"
10,16,4,"Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine"
10,16,5,"And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, from there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name"
10,16,6,"And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men"
10,16,7,"And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou worthless fellow:"
10,16,8,"The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou"
10,16,9,"Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head."
10,16,10,"And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said to him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Why hast thou done so?"
10,16,11,"And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my own body, seeketh my life: how much more now"
10,16,12,"It may be that the LORD will look on my affliction, and that the LORD will repay me good for his cursing this day."
10,16,13,"And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill’s side opposite him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust."
10,16,14,"And the king, and all the people that"
10,16,15,"And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him."
10,16,16,"And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, had come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, God save the king, God save the king."
10,16,17,"And Absalom said to Hushai,"
10,16,18,"And Hushai said to Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide."
10,16,19,"And again, whom should I serve?"
10,16,20,"Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do."
10,16,21,"And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to thy father’s concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred by thy father: then shall the hands of all that"
10,16,22,"So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel."
10,16,23,"And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days,"
10,17,1,"Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:"
10,17,2,"And I will come upon him while he"
10,17,3,"And I will bring back all the people to thee: the man whom thou seekest"
10,17,4,"And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel."
10,17,5,"Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith."
10,17,6,"And when Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do"
10,17,7,"And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given"
10,17,8,"For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they"
10,17,9,"Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some"
10,17,10,"And he also"
10,17,11,"Therefore I counsel that all Israel should be generally gathered to thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that"
10,17,12,"So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that"
10,17,13,"Moreover, if he shall have entered into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there is not one small stone found there."
10,17,14,"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite"
10,17,15,"Then said Hushai to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled."
10,17,16,"Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that"
10,17,17,"Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a maidservant went and told them; and they went and told king David."
10,17,18,"Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; into which they descended."
10,17,19,"And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and spread ground grain on it; and the thing was not known."
10,17,20,"And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where"
10,17,21,"And it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came out of the well, and went and told king David, and said to David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you."
10,17,22,"Then David arose, and all the people that"
10,17,23,"And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled"
10,17,24,"Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him."
10,17,25,"And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa"
10,17,26,"So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead."
10,17,27,"And it came to pass, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,"
10,17,28,"Brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and roasted"
10,17,29,"And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of cows, for David, and for the people that"
10,18,1,"And David numbered the people that"
10,18,2,"And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also."
10,18,3,"But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now"
10,18,4,"And the king said to them, What seemeth to you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands."
10,18,5,"And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,"
10,18,6,"So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim;"
10,18,7,"Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand"
10,18,8,"For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured."
10,18,9,"And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught fast in the oak, and he was left hanging between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that"
10,18,10,"And a certain man saw"
10,18,11,"And Joab said to the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest"
10,18,12,"And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand"
10,18,13,"Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against my own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against"
10,18,14,"Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three spears in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he"
10,18,15,"And ten young men that bore Joab’s armour surrounded and smote Absalom, and slew him."
10,18,16,"And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel: for Joab restrained the people."
10,18,17,"And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the forest, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent."
10,18,18,"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and built for himself a pillar, which"
10,18,19,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and inform the king, how the LORD hath avenged himself of his enemies."
10,18,20,"And Joab said to him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead."
10,18,21,"Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself to Joab, and ran."
10,18,22,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But however, let me also, I pray thee, run after Cushi. And Joab said, Why wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?"
10,18,23,"But however,"
10,18,24,"And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone."
10,18,25,"And the watchman called, and told the king. And the king said, If he"
10,18,26,"And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called to the porter, and said, Behold"
10,18,27,"And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He"
10,18,28,"And Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed"
10,18,29,"And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant, and"
10,18,30,"And the king said"
10,18,31,"And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee."
10,18,32,"And the king said to Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, May the enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do"
10,18,33,"And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! O that I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10,19,1,"And it was told to Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom."
10,19,2,"And the victory that day was"
10,19,3,"And the people withdrew by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle."
10,19,4,"But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10,19,5,"And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;"
10,19,6,"In that thou lovest thy enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well."
10,19,7,"Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak kindly to thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou shalt not go forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse to thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now."
10,19,8,"Then the king rose, and sat in the gate. And they told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent."
10,19,9,"And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us from the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us from the hand of the Philistines; and now he hath fled out of the land for Absalom."
10,19,10,"And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?"
10,19,11,"And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king,"
10,19,12,"Ye"
10,19,13,"And say ye to Amasa,"
10,19,14,"And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as"
10,19,15,"So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan."
10,19,16,"And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, who"
10,19,17,"And"
10,19,18,"And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he came over Jordan;"
10,19,19,"And said to the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity to me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart."
10,19,20,"For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I have come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king."
10,19,21,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’S anointed?"
10,19,22,"And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries to me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I"
10,19,23,"Therefore the king said to Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king swore to him."
10,19,24,"And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither cared for his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came"
10,19,25,"And it came to pass, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why didst thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?"
10,19,26,"And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may ride on it, and go to the king; because thy servant"
10,19,27,"And he hath slandered thy servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king"
10,19,28,"For all"
10,19,29,"And the king said to him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land."
10,19,30,"And Mephibosheth said to the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king hath come again in peace to his own house."
10,19,31,"And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan."
10,19,32,"Now Barzillai was a very aged man,"
10,19,33,"And the king said to Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem."
10,19,34,"And Barzillai said to the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?"
10,19,35,"I"
10,19,36,"Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense me with such a reward?"
10,19,37,"Let thy servant, I pray thee, return again, that I may die in my own city,"
10,19,38,"And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to thee: and whatever thou shalt require of me,"
10,19,39,"And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king had come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place."
10,19,40,"Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel."
10,19,41,"And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to him, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David’s men with him, over Jordan?"
10,19,42,"And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king"
10,19,43,"And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more"
10,20,1,"And there happened to be there a worthless fellow, whose name"
10,20,2,"So every man of Israel withdrew from following David, followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah held fast to their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem."
10,20,3,"And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women"
10,20,4,"Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble to me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present."
10,20,5,"So Amasa went to assemble"
10,20,6,"And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than"
10,20,7,"And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri."
10,20,8,"When they"
10,20,9,"And Joab said to Amasa,"
10,20,10,"But Amasa took no heed to the sword that"
10,20,11,"And one of Joab’s men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that"
10,20,12,"And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still."
10,20,13,"When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri."
10,20,14,"And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him."
10,20,15,"And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that"
10,20,16,"Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, to Joab, Come here, that I may speak with thee."
10,20,17,"And when he was come near to her, the woman said,"
10,20,18,"Then she spoke, saying, They were accustomed to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask"
10,20,19,"I"
10,20,20,"And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy."
10,20,21,"The matter"
10,20,22,"Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast"
10,20,23,"Now Joab"
10,20,24,"And Adoram"
10,20,25,"And Sheva"
10,20,26,"And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler of David."
10,21,1,"Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered,"
10,21,2,"And the king called the Gibeonites, and said to them; (now the Gibeonites"
10,21,3,"Therefore David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and how shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?"
10,21,4,"And the Gibeonites said to him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say,"
10,21,5,"And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us"
10,21,6,"Let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to the LORD in Gibeah of Saul,"
10,21,7,"But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD’S oath that"
10,21,8,"But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:"
10,21,9,"And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before the LORD: and they fell"
10,21,10,"And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until the rain poured on them from heaven, and allowed neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night."
10,21,11,"And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done."
10,21,12,"And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, who had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:"
10,21,13,"And he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged."
10,21,14,"And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son they buried in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land."
10,21,15,"Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David became faint."
10,21,16,"And Ishbibenob, who"
10,21,17,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, Thou shalt go out no more with us to battle, that thou mayest not put out the light of Israel."
10,21,18,"And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, who"
10,21,19,"And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew"
10,21,20,"And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of"
10,21,21,"And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea the brother of David slew him."
10,21,22,"These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants."
10,22,1,"And David spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day"
10,22,2,"And he said, The LORD"
10,22,3,"The God of my rock; in him will I trust:"
10,22,4,"I will call on the LORD,"
10,22,5,"When the waves of death surrounded me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;"
10,22,6,"The sorrows of hell surrounded me; the snares of death seized me;"
10,22,7,"In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry"
10,22,8,"Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was angry."
10,22,9,"There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it."
10,22,10,"He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness"
10,22,11,"And he rode upon a cherub, and flew: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind."
10,22,12,"And he made darkness pavilions around him, dark waters,"
10,22,13,"Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled."
10,22,14,"The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice."
10,22,15,"And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and smote them."
10,22,16,"And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were laid open, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils."
10,22,17,"He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;"
10,22,18,"He delivered me from my strong enemy, from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me."
10,22,19,"They fell upon me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my support."
10,22,20,"He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me."
10,22,21,"The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me."
10,22,22,"For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God."
10,22,23,"For all his judgments"
10,22,24,"I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from my iniquity."
10,22,25,"Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight."
10,22,26,"With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful,"
10,22,27,"With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt contend."
10,22,28,"And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thy eyes"
10,22,29,"For thou"
10,22,30,"For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall."

11,1,19,"And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath invited all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not invited."
11,1,20,"And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel"
11,1,21,"Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders."
11,1,22,"And, lo, while she was yet talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in."
11,1,23,"And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground."
11,1,24,"And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?"
11,1,25,"For he hath gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath invited all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah."
11,1,26,"But me,"
11,1,27,"Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shown"
11,1,28,"Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king."
11,1,29,"And the king swore, and said,"
11,1,30,"Even as I swore to thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day."
11,1,31,"Then Bathsheba bowed with"
11,1,32,"And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king."
11,1,33,"The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:"
11,1,34,"And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon."
11,1,35,"Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah."
11,1,36,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so"

11,1,38,"So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon."
11,1,39,"And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon."
11,1,40,"And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with the sound of them."

11,1,42,"And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said to him, Come in; for thou"

11,1,44,"And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule:"
11,1,45,"And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they have come from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This"
11,1,46,"And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom."
11,1,47,"And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed."
11,1,48,"And also thus said the king, Blessed"
11,1,49,"And all the guests that"
11,1,50,"And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar."
11,1,51,"And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword."
11,1,52,"And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die."
11,1,53,"So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said to him, Go to thy house."
11,2,1,"Now the days of David drew near that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,"
11,2,2,"I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man;"
11,2,3,"And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and wherever thou turnest thyself:"
11,2,4,"That the LORD may continue his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel."
11,2,5,"Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,"
11,2,6,"Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his gray head go down to the grave in peace."
11,2,7,"But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother."
11,2,8,"And, behold,"
11,2,9,"Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou"
11,2,10,"So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David."
11,2,11,"And the days that David reigned over Israel"
11,2,12,"Then Solomon was seated upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly."
11,2,13,"And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably."
11,2,14,"He said moreover, I have somewhat to say to thee. And she said, Say on."
11,2,15,"And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and"
11,2,16,"And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said to him, Say on."
11,2,17,"And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king, (for he will not say to thee no,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife."
11,2,18,"And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee to the king."
11,2,19,"Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand."
11,2,20,"Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee;"
11,2,21,"And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother for a wife."
11,2,22,"And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he"
11,2,23,"Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life."
11,2,24,"Now therefore,"
11,2,25,"And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died."
11,2,26,"And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Depart to Anathoth, to thy own fields; for thou"
11,2,27,"So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh."
11,2,28,"Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar."
11,2,29,"And it was told to king Solomon that Joab had fled to the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold,"
11,2,30,"And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said to him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me."
11,2,31,"And the king said to him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father."
11,2,32,"And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing"
11,2,33,"Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD."
11,2,34,"So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness."
11,2,35,"And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his stead over the army: and Zadok the priest the king put in the stead of Abiathar."
11,2,36,"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth from there to any place whatever."
11,2,37,"For it shall be,"
11,2,38,"And Shimei said to the king, The saying"
11,2,39,"And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants"
11,2,40,"And Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath."
11,2,41,"And it was told to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned."
11,2,42,"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protest to thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest any where abroad, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst to me, The word"
11,2,43,"Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?"
11,2,44,"The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is aware of, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thy own head;"
11,2,45,"And king Solomon"
11,2,46,"So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon."
11,3,1,"And Solomon allied himself with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and married Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had finished building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem on every side."
11,3,2,"Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days."
11,3,3,"And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places."
11,3,4,"And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that"
11,3,5,"In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee."
11,3,6,"And Solomon said, Thou hast shown to thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as"
11,3,7,"And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I"
11,3,8,"And thy servant"
11,3,9,"Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?"
11,3,10,"And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing."
11,3,11,"And God said to him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thy enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;"
11,3,12,"Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like thee."
11,3,13,"And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like thee all thy days."
11,3,14,"And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days."
11,3,15,"And Solomon awoke; and, behold,"
11,3,16,"Then came there two women,"
11,3,17,"And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house."
11,3,18,"And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we"
11,3,19,"And this woman’s child died in the night; because she lay on him."
11,3,20,"And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom."
11,3,21,"And when I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, he was dead: but when I had looked at him in the morning, behold, he was not my son, whom I bore."
11,3,22,"And the other woman said, Nay; but the living"
11,3,23,"Then said the king, The one saith, This"
11,3,24,"And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king."
11,3,25,"And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other."
11,3,26,"Then spoke the woman whose the living child"
11,3,27,"Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and by no means slay him: she"
11,3,28,"And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God"
11,4,1,"So king Solomon was king over all Israel."
11,4,2,"And these"
11,4,3,"Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder."
11,4,4,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada"
11,4,5,"And Azariah the son of Nathan"
11,4,6,"And Ahishar"
11,4,7,"And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision."

11,7,38,"Then he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths:"
11,7,39,"And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward toward the south."
11,7,40,"And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished doing all the work that he made for king Solomon for the house of the LORD:"
11,7,41,"The two pillars, and the"

11,11,9,"And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,"
11,11,10,"And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded."
11,11,11,"Therefore the LORD said to Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done by thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom away from thee, and will give it to thy servant."
11,11,12,"However in thy days I will not do it for David thy father’s sake:"
11,11,13,"Yet I will not rend away all the kingdom;"
11,11,14,"And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he"
11,11,15,"For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host had gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;"
11,11,16,"(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)"
11,11,17,"That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad"
11,11,18,"And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them from Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt; who gave him an house, and appointed him food, and gave him land."
11,11,19,"And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him for a wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen."
11,11,20,"And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons of Pharaoh."
11,11,21,"And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country."
11,11,22,"Then Pharaoh said to him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thy own country? And he answered, Nothing: only let me go."
11,11,23,"And God stirred him up"
11,11,24,"And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them"
11,11,25,"And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad"
11,11,26,"And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon’s servant, whose mother’s name"
11,11,27,"And this"
11,11,28,"And the man Jeroboam"
11,11,29,"And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two"
11,11,30,"And Ahijah caught the new garment that"
11,11,31,"And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:"
11,11,32,"(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)"
11,11,33,"Because they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do"
11,11,34,"Yet I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:"
11,11,35,"But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it to thee,"
11,11,36,"And to his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for me to put my name there."
11,11,37,"And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel."
11,11,38,"And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken to all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to thee."
11,11,39,"And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever."
11,11,40,"Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon."
11,11,41,"And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom,"
11,11,42,"And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel"
11,11,43,"And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead."
11,12,1,"And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king."
11,12,2,"And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard"
11,12,3,"That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,"
11,12,4,"Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee."
11,12,5,"And he said to them, Depart yet"
11,12,6,"And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?"
11,12,7,"And they spoke to him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant to this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever."
11,12,8,"But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that had grown up with him,"
11,12,9,"And he said to them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?"
11,12,10,"And the young men that had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak to this people who spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou"
11,12,11,"And now though my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."
11,12,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day."
11,12,13,"And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s counsel that they gave him;"
11,12,14,"And spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father"
11,12,15,"Therefore the king hearkened not to the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat."
11,12,16,"So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither"
11,12,17,"But"
11,12,18,"Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who"
11,12,19,"So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day."
11,12,20,"And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come again, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only."
11,12,21,"And when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon."
11,12,22,"But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,"
11,12,23,"Speak to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,"
11,12,24,"Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD."
11,12,25,"Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt in it; and went out from there, and built Penuel."
11,12,26,"And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:"
11,12,27,"If this people go up to offer sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again to their lord,"
11,12,28,"Upon which the king took counsel, and made two calves"
11,12,29,"And he set the one in Bethel, and the other he placed in Dan."
11,12,30,"And this thing became a sin: for the people went"
11,12,31,"And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi."
11,12,32,"And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that"
11,12,33,"So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month,"
11,13,1,"And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense."
11,13,2,"And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men’s bones shall be burnt upon thee."
11,13,3,"And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This"
11,13,4,"And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, who had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it to him again."
11,13,5,"The altar also was split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD."
11,13,6,"And the king answered and said to the man of God, Entreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king’s hand was restored to him again, and became as"
11,13,7,"And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward."
11,13,8,"And the man of God said to the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:"
11,13,9,"For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest."
11,13,10,"So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel."
11,13,11,"Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken to the king, them they told also to their father."
11,13,12,"And their father said to them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, who came from Judah."
11,13,13,"And he said to his sons, Saddle me the donkey. So they saddled him the donkey: and he rode on it,"
11,13,14,"And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said to him,"
11,13,15,"Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread."
11,13,16,"And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:"
11,13,17,"For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest."
11,13,18,"He said to him, I"
11,13,19,"So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water."
11,13,20,"And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet that brought him back:"
11,13,21,"And he cried to the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,"
11,13,22,"But hast returned, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of which"
11,13,23,"And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the donkey,"
11,13,24,"And when he had gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his body was cast in the way, and the donkey stood by it, the lion also stood by the body."
11,13,25,"And, behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body: and they came and told"
11,13,26,"And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard"
11,13,27,"And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the donkey. And they saddled"
11,13,28,"And he went and found his body cast in the way, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body: the lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the donkey."
11,13,29,"And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the donkey, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him."
11,13,30,"And he laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him,"
11,13,31,"And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre in which the man of God"
11,13,32,"For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which"
11,13,33,"After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became"
11,13,34,"And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut"
11,14,1,"At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick."
11,14,2,"And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou mayest not be known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and go to Shiloh: behold, there"
11,14,3,"And take with thee ten loaves, and cakes, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child."
11,14,4,"And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were dim by reason of his age."
11,14,5,"And the LORD said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he"
11,14,6,"And it was"
11,14,7,"Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,"
11,14,8,"And tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to thee: and"
11,14,9,"But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:"
11,14,10,"Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam the males,"
11,14,11,"Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken"
11,14,12,"Arise thou therefore, depart to thy own house:"
11,14,13,"And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found"
11,14,14,"Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now."
11,14,15,"For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their idols, provoking the LORD to anger."
11,14,16,"And he shall give up Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned, and who made Israel to sin."
11,14,17,"And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:"
11,14,18,"And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet."
11,14,19,"And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they"
11,14,20,"And the days which Jeroboam reigned"
11,14,21,"And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam"
11,14,22,"And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done."
11,14,23,"For they also built for themselves high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree."
11,14,24,"And there were also sodomites in the land:"
11,14,25,"And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam,"
11,14,26,"And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made."
11,14,27,"And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed"
11,14,28,"And it was"
11,14,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did,"
11,14,30,"And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all"
11,14,31,"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother’s name"
11,15,1,"Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah."
11,15,2,"Three years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name"
11,15,3,"And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father."
11,15,4,"Nevertheless for David’s sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:"
11,15,5,"Because David did"
11,15,6,"And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life."
11,15,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did,"
11,15,8,"And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead."
11,15,9,"And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah."
11,15,10,"And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name"
11,15,11,"And Asa did"
11,15,12,"And he banished the sodomites from the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made."
11,15,13,"And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from"
11,15,14,"But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart was perfect with the LORD all his days."
11,15,15,"And he brought the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels."
11,15,16,"And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days."
11,15,17,"And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah."
11,15,18,"Then Asa took all the silver and the gold"
11,15,19,""
11,15,20,"So Benhadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of the armies which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali."
11,15,21,"And it came to pass, when Baasha heard"
11,15,22,"Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none"
11,15,23,"The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built,"
11,15,24,"And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead."
11,15,25,"And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years."
11,15,26,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin which he made Israel to sin."
11,15,27,"And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which"
11,15,28,"Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead."
11,15,29,"And it came to pass, when he reigned,"
11,15,30,"Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation with which he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger."
11,15,31,"Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did,"
11,15,32,"And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days."
11,15,33,"In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years."
11,15,34,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he made Israel to sin."
11,16,1,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,"
11,16,2,"Forasmuch as I exalted thee from the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;"
11,16,3,"Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat."
11,16,4,"Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat."
11,16,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might,"
11,16,6,"So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead."
11,16,7,"And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him."
11,16,8,"In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years."
11,16,9,"And his servant Zimri, captain of half"
11,16,10,"And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead."
11,16,11,"And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne,"
11,16,12,"Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,"
11,16,13,"For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities."
11,16,14,"Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did,"
11,16,15,"In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people"
11,16,16,"And the people"
11,16,17,"And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah."
11,16,18,"And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died,"
11,16,19,"For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin."
11,16,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought,"
11,16,21,"Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri."
11,16,22,"But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned."
11,16,23,"In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah."
11,16,24,"And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria."
11,16,25,"But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that"
11,16,26,"For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin which he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities."
11,16,27,"Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed,"
11,16,28,"So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead."
11,16,29,"And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years."
11,16,30,"And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that"
11,16,31,"And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took for a wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him."
11,16,32,"And he built an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria."
11,16,33,"And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him."
11,16,34,"In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho: he laid the foundation of it in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates of it in his youngest"
11,17,1,"And Elijah the Tishbite,"
11,17,2,"And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,"
11,17,3,"Depart from here, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that"
11,17,4,"And it shall be,"
11,17,5,"So he went and did according to the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that"
11,17,6,"And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook."
11,17,7,"And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land."
11,17,8,"And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,"
11,17,9,"Arise, go to Zarephath, which"
11,17,10,"So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman"
11,17,11,"And as she was going to bring"
11,17,12,"And she said,"
11,17,13,"And Elijah said to her, Fear not; go"
11,17,14,"For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not be used up, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day"
11,17,15,"And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, ate"
11,17,16,""
11,17,17,"And it came to pass after these things,"
11,17,18,"And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come to me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?"
11,17,19,"And he said to her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed."
11,17,20,"And he cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?"
11,17,21,"And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into him again."
11,17,22,"And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived."
11,17,23,"And Elijah took the child, and brought him down from the chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth."
11,17,24,"And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou"
11,18,1,"And it came to pass"
11,18,2,"And Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. And"
11,18,3,"And Ahab called Obadiah, who"
11,18,4,"For it was"
11,18,5,"And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land, to all fountains of water, and to all brooks: perhaps we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts."
11,18,6,"So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself."
11,18,7,"And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said,"
11,18,8,"And he answered him, I"
11,18,9,"And he said, How have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?"
11,18,10,""
11,18,11,"And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah"
11,18,12,"And it shall come to pass,"
11,18,13,"Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?"
11,18,14,"And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah"
11,18,15,"And Elijah said,"
11,18,16,"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah."
11,18,17,"And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him,"
11,18,18,"And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim."
11,18,19,"Now therefore send,"
11,18,20,"So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to mount Carmel."
11,18,21,"And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD"
11,18,22,"Then said Elijah to the people, I,"
11,18,23,"Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay"
11,18,24,"And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken."
11,18,25,"And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose one bull for yourselves, and prepare"
11,18,26,"And they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared"
11,18,27,"And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he"
11,18,28,"And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them."
11,18,29,"And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the"
11,18,30,"And Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD"
11,18,31,"And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:"
11,18,32,"And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed."
11,18,33,"And he put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces, and laid"
11,18,34,"And he said, Do"
11,18,35,"And the water ran around the altar; and he filled the trench also with water."
11,18,36,"And it came to pass at"
11,18,37,"Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou"
11,18,38,"Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that"
11,18,39,"And when all the people saw"
11,18,40,"And Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there."
11,18,41,"And Elijah said to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink; for"
11,18,42,"So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,"
11,18,43,"And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said,"
11,18,44,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Prepare"
11,18,45,"And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel."
11,18,46,"And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel."
11,19,1,"And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had slain all the prophets with the sword."
11,19,2,"Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do"
11,19,3,"And when he saw"
11,19,4,"But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I"
11,19,5,"And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise"
11,19,6,"And he looked, and, behold,"
11,19,7,"And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise"
11,19,8,"And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God."
11,19,9,"And he came there to a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD"
11,19,10,"And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away."
11,19,11,"And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD;"
11,19,12,"And after the earthquake a fire;"
11,19,13,"And it was"
11,19,14,"And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away."
11,19,15,"And the LORD said to him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael"
11,19,16,"And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint"
11,19,17,"And it shall come to pass,"
11,19,18,"Yet I have left to"
11,19,19,"So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who"
11,19,20,"And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and"
11,19,21,"And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him."
11,20,1,"And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together: and"
11,20,2,"And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said to him, Thus saith Benhadad,"
11,20,3,"Thy silver and thy gold"
11,20,4,"And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I"
11,20,5,"And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent to thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver to me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;"
11,20,6,"Yet I will send my servants to thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be,"
11,20,7,"Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this"
11,20,8,"And all the elders and all the people said to him, Hearken not"
11,20,9,"Therefore he said to the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again."
11,20,10,"And Benhadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me."
11,20,11,"And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell"
11,20,12,"And it came to pass, when"
11,20,13,"And, behold, there came a prophet to Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I"
11,20,14,"And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD,"
11,20,15,"Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty and two: and after them he numbered all the people,"
11,20,16,"And they went out at noon. But Benhadad"
11,20,17,"And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria."
11,20,18,"And he said, Whether they have come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they have come out for war, take them alive."
11,20,19,"So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them."
11,20,20,"And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen."
11,20,21,"And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter."
11,20,22,"And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee."
11,20,23,"And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their gods"
11,20,24,"And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their places:"
11,20,25,"And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain,"
11,20,26,"And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel."
11,20,27,"And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country."
11,20,28,"And there came a man of God, and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD"
11,20,29,"And they encamped opposite one another seven days. And"
11,20,30,"But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and"
11,20,31,"And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel"
11,20,32,"So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and"
11,20,33,"Now the men diligently observed whether"
11,20,34,"And"
11,20,35,"And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him."
11,20,36,"Then said he to him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou hast departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he had departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him."
11,20,37,"Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded"
11,20,38,"So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face."
11,20,39,"And as the king passed by, he cried to the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he shall be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver."
11,20,40,"And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, So"
11,20,41,"And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel knew that he"
11,20,42,"And he said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of"
11,20,43,"And the king of Israel went to his house sad and displeased, and came to Samaria."
11,21,1,"And it came to pass after these things,"
11,21,2,"And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it"
11,21,3,"And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee."
11,21,4,"And Ahab came into his house sad and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid himself down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food."
11,21,5,"But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no food?"
11,21,6,"And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it pleaseth thee, I will give thee"
11,21,7,"And Jezebel his wife said to him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise,"
11,21,8,"So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed"
11,21,9,"And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:"
11,21,10,"And set two men, worthless men, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And"
11,21,11,"And the men of his city,"
11,21,12,"They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people."
11,21,13,"And there came in two men, worthless men, and sat before him: and the worthless men witnessed against him,"
11,21,14,"Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead."
11,21,15,"And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead."
11,21,16,"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it."
11,21,17,"And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,"
11,21,18,"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who"
11,21,19,"And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine."
11,21,20,"And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found"
11,21,21,"Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab the males, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,"
11,21,22,"And will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which thou hast provoked"
11,21,23,"And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel."
11,21,24,"Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat."
11,21,25,"But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up."
11,21,26,"And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all"
11,21,27,"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly."
11,21,28,"And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,"
11,21,29,"Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days:"
11,22,1,"And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel."
11,22,2,"And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel."
11,22,3,"And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead"
11,22,4,"And he said to Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I"
11,22,5,"And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day."
11,22,6,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver"
11,22,7,"And Jehoshaphat said,"
11,22,8,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat,"
11,22,9,"Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten"
11,22,10,"And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a threshingfloor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them."
11,22,11,"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou hast consumed them."
11,22,12,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver"
11,22,13,"And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets"
11,22,14,"And Micaiah said,"
11,22,15,"So he came to the king. And the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver"
11,22,16,"And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but"
11,22,17,"And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace."
11,22,18,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?"
11,22,19,"And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left."
11,22,20,"And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said in this manner, and another said in that manner."
11,22,21,"And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him."
11,22,22,"And the LORD said to him, How? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade"
11,22,23,"Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee."
11,22,24,"But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to thee?"
11,22,25,"And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself."
11,22,26,"And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;"
11,22,27,"And say, Thus saith the king, Put this"
11,22,28,"And Micaiah said, If thou shalt return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, each one of you."
11,22,29,"So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead."
11,22,30,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle."
11,22,31,"But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel."
11,22,32,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely this"
11,22,33,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that he"
11,22,34,"And a"
11,22,35,"And the battle increased that day: and the king was held up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at evening: and the blood ran out of the wound into the inside of the chariot."
11,22,36,"And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the setting of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country."
11,22,37,"So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria."
11,22,38,"And"
11,22,39,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built,"
11,22,40,"So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead."
11,22,41,"And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel."
11,22,42,"Jehoshaphat"
11,22,43,"And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing"
11,22,44,"And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel."
11,22,45,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred,"
11,22,46,"And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he removed from the land."
11,22,47,""
11,22,48,"Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber."
11,22,49,"Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not."
11,22,50,"And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead."
11,22,51,"Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel."
11,22,52,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:"
11,22,53,"For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done."
12,1,1,"Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab."
12,1,2,"And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that"
12,1,3,"But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them,"
12,1,4,"Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed."
12,1,5,"And when the messengers returned to him, he said to them, Why have ye now returned?"
12,1,6,"And they said to him, There came up a man to meet us, and said to us, Go, return to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD,"
12,1,7,"And he said to them, What manner of man"
12,1,8,"And they answered him,"
12,1,9,"Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spoke to him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down."
12,1,10,"And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I"
12,1,11,"Again also he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly."
12,1,12,"And Elijah answered and said to them, If I"
12,1,13,"And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said to him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight."
12,1,14,"Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight."
12,1,15,"And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king."
12,1,16,"And he said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron,"
12,1,17,"So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son."
12,1,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did,"
12,2,1,"And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal."
12,2,2,"And Elijah said to Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said"
12,2,3,"And the sons of the prophets that"
12,2,4,"And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said,"
12,2,5,"And the sons of the prophets that"
12,2,6,"And Elijah said to him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said,"
12,2,7,"And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan."
12,2,8,"And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped"
12,2,9,"And it came to pass, when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me."
12,2,10,"And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing:"
12,2,11,"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold,"
12,2,12,"And Elisha saw"
12,2,13,"He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;"
12,2,14,"And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where"
12,2,15,"And when the sons of the prophets who"
12,2,16,"And they said to him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest perhaps the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send."
12,2,17,"And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not."
12,2,18,"And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?"
12,2,19,"And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city"
12,2,20,"And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt in it. And they brought"
12,2,21,"And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or barren"
12,2,22,"So the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke."
12,2,23,"And he went up from there to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth youths out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head."
12,2,24,"And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two youths of them."
12,2,25,"And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria."
12,3,1,"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria"
12,3,2,"And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made."
12,3,3,"Nevertheless he cleaved to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not from it."
12,3,4,"And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool."
12,3,5,"But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel."
12,3,6,"And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel."
12,3,7,"And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go: I"
12,3,8,"And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom."
12,3,9,"So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they made a circuit of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that followed them."
12,3,10,"And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!"
12,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat said,"
12,3,12,"And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him."
12,3,13,"And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab."
12,3,14,"And Elisha said,"
12,3,15,"But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him."
12,3,16,"And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches."
12,3,17,"For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts."
12,3,18,"And this is"
12,3,19,"And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones."
12,3,20,"And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water."
12,3,21,"And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border."
12,3,22,"And they rose early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side"
12,3,23,"And they said, This"
12,3,24,"And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in"
12,3,25,"And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth they left the stones of it; but the slingers went about"
12,3,26,"And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom: but they could not."
12,3,27,"Then he took his eldest son that was to reign in his stead, and offered him"
12,4,1,"Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant feared the LORD: and the creditor hath come to take to my two sons to be his slaves."
12,4,2,"And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath not any thing in the house, except a pot of oil."
12,4,3,"Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours,"
12,4,4,"And when thou hast come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full."
12,4,5,"So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought"
12,4,6,"And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her,"
12,4,7,"Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children on the rest."
12,4,8,"And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where"
12,4,9,"And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this"
12,4,10,"Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, with walls; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a lampstand: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in there."
12,4,11,"And it fell on a day, that he came there, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there."
12,4,12,"And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him."
12,4,13,"And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what"
12,4,14,"And he said, What then"
12,4,15,"And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door."
12,4,16,"And he said, About this season, next year, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord,"
12,4,17,"And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season that Elisha had said to her, according to the set time."
12,4,18,"And when the child was grown, it happened on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers."
12,4,19,"And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother."
12,4,20,"And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and"
12,4,21,"And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut"
12,4,22,"And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again."
12,4,23,"And he said, Why wilt thou go to him to day?"
12,4,24,"Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not"
12,4,25,"So she went and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold,"
12,4,26,"Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to her,"
12,4,27,"And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul"
12,4,28,"Then she said, Did I ask a son from my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?"
12,4,29,"Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: and if thou shalt meet any man, greet him not; and if any shall greet thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child."
12,4,30,"And the mother of the child said,"
12,4,31,"And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but"
12,4,32,"And when Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead,"
12,4,33,"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them both, and prayed to the LORD."
12,4,34,"And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child became warm."
12,4,35,"Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes."
12,4,36,"And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she had come in to him, he said, Take up thy son."
12,4,37,"Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out."
12,4,38,"And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and"
12,4,39,"And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred"
12,4,40,"So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O"
12,4,41,"But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast"
12,4,42,"And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of grain in its husk. And he said, Give to the people, that they may eat."
12,4,43,"And his servant said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall have"
12,4,44,"So he set"
12,5,1,"Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance to Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour,"
12,5,2,"And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman’s wife."
12,5,3,"And she said to her mistress, I would that my lord"
12,5,4,"And"
12,5,5,"And the king of Syria said, Go, now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand"
12,5,6,"And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter hath come to thee, behold,"
12,5,7,"And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said,"
12,5,8,"And it was"
12,5,9,"So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha."
12,5,10,"And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean."
12,5,11,"But Naaman was furious, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and cure the leprosy."
12,5,12,""
12,5,13,"And his servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father,"
12,5,14,"Then he went down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean."
12,5,15,"And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that"
12,5,16,"But he said,"
12,5,17,"And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules’ burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD."
12,5,18,"In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant,"
12,5,19,"And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way."
12,5,20,"But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but,"
12,5,21,"So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw"
12,5,22,"And he said, All"
12,5,23,"And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid"
12,5,24,"And when he came to the tower, he took"
12,5,25,"But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, From where"
12,5,26,"And he said to him, Went not my heart"
12,5,27,"The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave to thee, and to thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper"
12,6,1,"And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too small for us."
12,6,2,"Let us go, we pray thee, to Jordan, and take from there every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye."
12,6,3,"And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go."
12,6,4,"So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood."
12,6,5,"But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed."
12,6,6,"And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast"
12,6,7,"Therefore said he, Take"
12,6,8,"Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place"
12,6,9,"And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for there the Syrians have come down."
12,6,10,"And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice."
12,6,11,"Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said to them, Will ye not show me which of us"
12,6,12,"And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that"
12,6,13,"And he said, Go and spy where he"
12,6,14,"Therefore he sent there horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and surrounded the city."
12,6,15,"And when the servant of the man of God had risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host surrounded the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?"
12,6,16,"And he answered, Fear not: for they that"
12,6,17,"And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain"
12,6,18,"And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha."
12,6,19,"And Elisha said to them, This"
12,6,20,"And it came to pass, when they had come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these"
12,6,21,"And the king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite"
12,6,22,"And he answered, Thou shalt not smite"
12,6,23,"And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel."
12,6,24,"And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria."
12,6,25,"And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until a donkey’s head was"
12,6,26,"And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king."
12,6,27,"And he said, If the LORD doth not help thee, how shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?"
12,6,28,"And the king said to her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said to me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow."
12,6,29,"So we boiled my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son."
12,6,30,"And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold,"
12,6,31,"Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day."
12,6,32,"But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and"
12,6,33,"And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down to him: and he said, Behold, this evil"
12,7,1,"Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time"
12,7,2,"Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold,"
12,7,3,"And there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?"
12,7,4,"If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine"
12,7,5,"And they rose in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians: and when they had come to the edge of the camp of Syria, behold,"
12,7,6,"For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses,"
12,7,7,"Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it"
12,7,8,"And when these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank, and carried from there silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid"
12,7,9,"Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day"
12,7,10,"So they came and called to the porter of the city: and they told him, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold,"
12,7,11,"And he called the porters; and they told"
12,7,12,"And the king arose in the night, and said to his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we"
12,7,13,"And one of his servants answered and said, Let"
12,7,14,"They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see."
12,7,15,"And they went after them to Jordan: and, lo, all the way"
12,7,16,"And the people went out, and plundered the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was"
12,7,17,"And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him."
12,7,18,"And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:"
12,7,19,"And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold,"
12,7,20,"And so it happened to him: for the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died."
12,8,1,"Then Elisha spoke to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wherever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years."
12,8,2,"And the woman arose, and did according to the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years."
12,8,3,"And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to appeal to the king for her house and for her land."
12,8,4,"And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done."
12,8,5,"And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, appealed to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this"
12,8,6,"And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that"
12,8,7,"And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told to him, saying, The man of God hath come here."
12,8,8,"And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?"
12,8,9,"So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?"
12,8,10,"And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, Thou mayest certainly recover: but the LORD hath showed me that he shall surely die."
12,8,11,"And he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept."
12,8,12,"And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do to the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child."
12,8,13,"And Hazael said, But what,"
12,8,14,"So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me"
12,8,15,"And it came to pass on the next day, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped"
12,8,16,"And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat"
12,8,17,"Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem."
12,8,18,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD."
12,8,19,"Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s sake, as he promised him to give him always a light,"
12,8,20,"In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves."
12,8,21,"So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites who surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents."
12,8,22,"Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time."
12,8,23,"And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did,"
12,8,24,"And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead."
12,8,25,"In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign."
12,8,26,"Two and twenty years old"
12,8,27,"And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as"
12,8,28,"And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram."
12,8,29,"And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick."
12,9,1,"And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramothgilead:"
12,9,2,"And when thou comest there, find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and take him to an inner chamber;"
12,9,3,"Then take the box of oil, and pour"
12,9,4,"So the young man,"
12,9,5,"And when he came, behold, the captains of the host"
12,9,6,"And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD,"
12,9,7,"And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel."
12,9,8,"For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab the males, both bound and free in Israel:"
12,9,9,"And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:"
12,9,10,"And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and"
12,9,11,"Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and"
12,9,12,"And they said,"
12,9,13,"Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put"
12,9,14,"So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria."
12,9,15,"But king Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it is your minds,"
12,9,16,"So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram."
12,9,17,"And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say,"
12,9,18,"So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king,"
12,9,19,"Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king,"
12,9,20,"And the watchman told, saying, He came even to them, and doth not return: and the driving"
12,9,21,"And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite."
12,9,22,"And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said,"
12,9,23,"And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah,"
12,9,24,"And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot."
12,9,25,"Then said"
12,9,26,"Surely I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will repay thee in this plot, saith the LORD. Now therefore take"
12,9,27,"But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw"
12,9,28,"And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David."
12,9,29,"And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah."
12,9,30,"And when Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard"
12,9,31,"And as Jehu entered the gate, she said,"
12,9,32,"And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who"
12,9,33,"And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and"
12,9,34,"And when he had come in, he ate and drank, and said, Go, see now this cursed"
12,9,35,"And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of"
12,9,36,"Therefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This"
12,9,37,"And the dead body of Jezebel shall be as refuse upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel;"
12,10,1,"And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab’s"
12,10,2,"Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons"
12,10,3,"Choose the best and most fit of your master’s sons, and set"
12,10,4,"But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?"
12,10,5,"And he that"
12,10,6,"Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye"
12,10,7,"And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent"
12,10,8,"And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning."
12,10,9,"And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye"
12,10,10,"Know now that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done"
12,10,11,"So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsmen, and his priests, until he left him none remaining."
12,10,12,"And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria."
12,10,13,"Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who"
12,10,14,"And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house,"
12,10,15,"And when he had departed from there, he came upon Jehonadab the son of Rechab"
12,10,16,"And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot."
12,10,17,"And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke to Elijah."
12,10,18,"And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little;"
12,10,19,"Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be missing: for I have a great sacrifice"
12,10,20,"And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed"
12,10,21,"And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another."
12,10,22,"And he said to him that"
12,10,23,"And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said to the worshippers of Baal, Search, and see that there are here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only."
12,10,24,"And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed eighty men without, and said,"
12,10,25,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in,"
12,10,26,"And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them."
12,10,27,"And they broke down the image of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a place of refuse to this day."
12,10,28,"Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel."
12,10,29,"Yet"
12,10,30,"And the LORD said to Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing"
12,10,31,"But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin."
12,10,32,"In those days the LORD began to cut off parts of Israel: and Hazael smote them in all the land of Israel;"
12,10,33,"From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which"
12,10,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might,"
12,10,35,"And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead."
12,10,36,"And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria"
12,11,1,"And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal."
12,11,2,"But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons"
12,11,3,"And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land."
12,11,4,"And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and took the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king’s son."
12,11,5,"And he commanded them, saying, This"
12,11,6,"And a third part"
12,11,7,"And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king."
12,11,8,"And ye shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranks, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in."
12,11,9,"And the captains over the hundreds did according to all"
12,11,10,"And to the captains over hundreds the priest gave king David’s spears and shields, that"
12,11,11,"And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, around the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple,"
12,11,12,"And he brought forth the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and"
12,11,13,"And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard"
12,11,14,"And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner"
12,11,15,"But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said to them, Have her forth beyond the ranks: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD."
12,11,16,"And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by which the horses came into the king’s house: and there was she slain."
12,11,17,"And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD’S people; between the king also and the people."
12,11,18,"And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images they broke wholly in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD."
12,11,19,"And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings."
12,11,20,"And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword"
12,11,21,"Seven years old"
12,12,1,"In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name"
12,12,2,"And Jehoash did"
12,12,3,"But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places."
12,12,4,"And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD,"
12,12,5,"Let the priests take"
12,12,6,"But it was"
12,12,7,"Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the"
12,12,8,"And the priests consented to receive no"
12,12,9,"But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put in it all the money"
12,12,10,"And it was"
12,12,11,"And they gave the money, being counted, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they paid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD,"
12,12,12,"And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair"
12,12,13,"Yet there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money"
12,12,14,"But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired with it the house of the LORD."
12,12,15,"Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully."
12,12,16,"The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests’."
12,12,17,"Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem."
12,12,18,"And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold"
12,12,19,"And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did,"
12,12,20,"And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla."
12,12,21,"For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead."
12,13,1,"In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria,"
12,13,2,"And he did"
12,13,3,"And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all"
12,13,4,"And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened to him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them."
12,13,5,"(And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as in times past."
12,13,6,"Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin,"
12,13,7,"Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing."
12,13,8,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might,"
12,13,9,"And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead."
12,13,10,"In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria,"
12,13,11,"And he did"
12,13,12,"And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah,"
12,13,13,"And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel."
12,13,14,"Now Elisha had fallen sick of his disease of which he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and its horsemen."
12,13,15,"And Elisha said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took to him bow and arrows."
12,13,16,"And he said to the king of Israel, Put thy hand upon the bow. And he put his hand"
12,13,17,"And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened"
12,13,18,"And he said, Take the arrows. And he took"
12,13,19,"And the man of God was angry with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed"
12,13,20,"And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year."
12,13,21,"And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band"
12,13,22,"But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz."
12,13,23,"And the LORD was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither did he cast them from his presence as yet."
12,13,24,"So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead."
12,13,25,"And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken from the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times Joash smote him, and recovered the cities of Israel."
12,14,1,"In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah."
12,14,2,"He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name"
12,14,3,"And he did"
12,14,4,"But the high places were not taken away: as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places."
12,14,5,"And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father."
12,14,6,"But the children of the murderers he slew not: according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, in which the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin."
12,14,7,"He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day."
12,14,8,"Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face."
12,14,9,"And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that"
12,14,10,"Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart hath lifted thee up: glory"
12,14,11,"But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh, which"
12,14,12,"And Judah was smitten by Israel; and they fled every man to their tents."
12,14,13,"And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits."
12,14,14,"And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria."
12,14,15,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah,"
12,14,16,"And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead."
12,14,17,"And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years."
12,14,18,"And the rest of the acts of Amaziah,"
12,14,19,"Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there."
12,14,20,"And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David."
12,14,21,"And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who"
12,14,22,"He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers."
12,14,23,"In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria,"
12,14,24,"And he did"
12,14,25,"He restored the land of Israel from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, who"
12,14,26,"For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel,"
12,14,27,"And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash."
12,14,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath,"
12,14,29,"And Jeroboam slept with his fathers,"
12,15,1,"In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign."
12,15,2,"Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name"
12,15,3,"And he did"
12,15,4,"Except that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places."
12,15,5,"And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house. And Jotham the king’s son"
12,15,6,"And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did,"
12,15,7,"So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead."
12,15,8,"In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months."
12,15,9,"And he did"
12,15,10,"And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead."
12,15,11,"And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they"

12,15,13,"Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria."

12,15,15,"And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they"
12,15,16,"Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that"
12,15,17,"In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel,"
12,15,18,"And he did"

12,15,35,"Yet the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD."
12,15,36,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did,"
12,15,37,"In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah."
12,15,38,"And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead."
12,16,1,"In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign."
12,16,2,"Twenty years old"
12,16,3,"But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and even made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel."
12,16,4,"And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree."
12,16,5,"Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome"
12,16,6,"At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and have dwelt there to this day."
12,16,7,"So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I"
12,16,8,"And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the king’s house, and sent"
12,16,9,"And the king of Assyria hearkened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried"
12,16,10,"And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that"
12,16,11,"And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made"
12,16,12,"And when the king had come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered on it."
12,16,13,"And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar."
12,16,14,"And he brought also the brasen altar, which"
12,16,15,"And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king’s burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire"
12,16,16,"Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded."
12,16,17,"And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that"
12,16,18,"And the covered place for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king’s entrance outside, he took from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria."
12,16,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did,"
12,16,20,"And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead."
12,17,1,"In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years."
12,17,2,"And he did"
12,17,3,"Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him tribute."
12,17,4,"And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no tribute to the king of Assyria, as"
12,17,5,"Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years."
12,17,6,"In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor"
12,17,7,"For"
12,17,8,"And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made."
12,17,9,"And the children of Israel did secretly things that"
12,17,10,"And they set up for themselves images and groves on every high hill, and under every green tree:"
12,17,11,"And there they burnt incense on all the high places, as"
12,17,12,"For they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, Ye shall not do this thing."
12,17,13,"Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets,"
12,17,14,"However they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God."
12,17,15,"And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that"
12,17,16,"And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made for themselves molten images,"
12,17,17,"And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger."
12,17,18,"Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only."
12,17,19,"Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made."
12,17,20,"And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight."
12,17,21,"For he tore Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin."
12,17,22,"For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;"
12,17,23,"Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day."
12,17,24,"And the king of Assyria brought"
12,17,25,"And"
12,17,26,"Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land."
12,17,27,"Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Take there one of the priests whom ye brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land."
12,17,28,"Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD."
12,17,29,"Yet every nation made gods of their own, and put"
12,17,30,"And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,"
12,17,31,"And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim."
12,17,32,"So they feared the LORD, and made to themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places."
12,17,33,"They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from there."
12,17,34,"To this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;"
12,17,35,"With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:"
12,17,36,"But the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye sacrifice."
12,17,37,"And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods."
12,17,38,"And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods."
12,17,39,"But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies."
12,17,40,"Yet they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner."
12,17,41,"So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children’s children: as did their fathers, so do they to this day."
12,18,1,"Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,"
12,18,2,"Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also"
12,18,3,"And he did"
12,18,4,"He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for till those days the children of Israel burnt incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan."
12,18,5,"He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor"
12,18,6,"For he clung to the LORD,"
12,18,7,"And the LORD was with him;"
12,18,8,"He smote the Philistines,"
12,18,9,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which"
12,18,10,"And at the end of three years they took it:"
12,18,11,"And the king of Assyria carried away Israel to Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor"
12,18,12,"Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant,"
12,18,13,"Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them."
12,18,14,"And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; withdraw from me: that which thou puttest on me I will bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold."
12,18,15,"And Hezekiah gave"
12,18,16,"At that time did Hezekiah cut off"
12,18,17,"And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which"
12,18,18,"And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who"
12,18,19,"And Rabshakeh said to them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence"
12,18,20,"Thou sayest, (but"
12,18,21,"Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed,"
12,18,22,"But if ye say to me, We trust in the LORD our God:"
12,18,23,"Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou shalt be able on thy part to set riders upon them."
12,18,24,"How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?"
12,18,25,"Have I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it."
12,18,26,"Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand"
12,18,27,"But Rabshakeh said to them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words?"
12,18,28,"Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:"
12,18,29,"Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:"
12,18,30,"Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria."
12,18,31,"Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make"
12,18,32,"Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not to Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us."
12,18,33,"Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?"
12,18,34,"Where"
12,18,35,"Who"
12,18,36,"But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not."
12,18,37,"Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who"
12,19,1,"And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard"
12,19,2,"And he sent Eliakim, who"
12,19,3,"And they said to him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day"
12,19,4,"It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: therefore lift up"
12,19,5,"So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah."
12,19,6,"And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me."
12,19,7,"Behold, I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land."
12,19,8,"So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish."
12,19,9,"And when he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Cush, Behold, he hath come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,"
12,19,10,"Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria."
12,19,11,"Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?"
12,19,12,"Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed;"
12,19,13,"Where"
12,19,14,"And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD."
12,19,15,"And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, who dwellest"
12,19,16,"LORD, bow down thy ear, and hear: open, LORD, thy eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent him to reproach the living God."
12,19,17,"Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,"
12,19,18,"And have cast their gods into the fire: for they"
12,19,19,"Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou"
12,19,20,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,"
12,19,21,"This"
12,19,22,"Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted"
12,19,23,"By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down its tall cedar trees,"
12,19,24,"I have dug and drank strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places."
12,19,25,"Hast thou not heard long ago"
12,19,26,"Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were"
12,19,27,"But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me."
12,19,28,"Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest."
12,19,29,"And this"
12,19,30,"And the remnant that hath escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward."
12,19,31,"For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape from mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD"
12,19,32,"Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it."
12,19,33,"By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD."
12,19,34,"For I will defend this city, to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake."
12,19,35,"And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred and eighty and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they"
12,19,36,"So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh."
12,19,37,"And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead."
12,20,1,"In those days was Hezekiah sick"
12,20,2,"Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the LORD, saying,"
12,20,3,"I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done"
12,20,4,"And it came to pass, before Isaiah had gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,"
12,20,5,"Return, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up to the house of the LORD."
12,20,6,"And I will add to thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake."
12,20,7,"And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid"
12,20,8,"And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What"
12,20,9,"And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?"
12,20,10,"And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees."
12,20,11,"And Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz."
12,20,12,"At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick."
12,20,13,"And Hezekiah hearkened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and"
12,20,14,"Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from where came they to thee? And Hezekiah said, They have come from a far country,"
12,20,15,"And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All"
12,20,16,"And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD."
12,20,17,"Behold, the days come, that all that"
12,20,18,"And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."
12,20,19,"Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good"
12,20,20,"And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city,"
12,20,21,"And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead."
12,21,1,"Manasseh"
12,21,2,"And he did"
12,21,3,"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them."
12,21,4,"And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name."
12,21,5,"And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD."
12,21,6,"And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with mediums and wizards: he committed much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke"
12,21,7,"And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:"
12,21,8,"Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them."
12,21,9,"But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel."
12,21,10,"And the LORD spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,"
12,21,11,"Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations,"
12,21,12,"Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I"
12,21,13,"And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as"
12,21,14,"And I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;"
12,21,15,"Because they have done"
12,21,16,"Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin which he made Judah to sin, in doing evil in the sight of the LORD."
12,21,17,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned,"
12,21,18,"And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead."
12,21,19,"Amon"
12,21,20,"And he did"
12,21,21,"And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:"
12,21,22,"And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD."
12,21,23,"And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house."
12,21,24,"And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead."
12,21,25,"Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did,"
12,21,26,"And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead."
12,22,1,"Josiah"
12,22,2,"And he did"
12,22,3,"And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah,"
12,22,4,"Go to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered from the people:"
12,22,5,"And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which"
12,22,6,"To carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house."
12,22,7,"But there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully."
12,22,8,"And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it."
12,22,9,"And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD."
12,22,10,"And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king."
12,22,11,"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his clothes."
12,22,12,"And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king’s, saying,"
12,22,13,"Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great"
12,22,14,"So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they talked with her."
12,22,15,"And she said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,"
12,22,16,"Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants,"
12,22,17,"Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched."
12,22,18,"But to the king of Judah who sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,"
12,22,19,"Because thy heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast torn thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard"
12,22,20,"Behold therefore, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thy eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again."
12,23,1,"And the king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem."
12,23,2,"And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD."
12,23,3,"And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all"
12,23,4,"And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel."
12,23,5,"And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places around Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven."
12,23,6,"And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped"
12,23,7,"And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, that"
12,23,8,"And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burnt incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and broke down the high places of the gates that"
12,23,9,"Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they ate of the unleavened bread among their brethren."
12,23,10,"And he defiled Topheth, which"
12,23,11,"And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which"
12,23,12,"And the altars that"
12,23,13,"And the high places that"
12,23,14,"And he broke in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men."
12,23,15,"Moreover the altar that"
12,23,16,"And as Josiah turned himself, he espied the sepulchres that"
12,23,17,"Then he said, What title"
12,23,18,"And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria."
12,23,19,"And all the houses also of the high places that"
12,23,20,"And he slew all the priests of the high places that"
12,23,21,"And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to the LORD your God, as"
12,23,22,"Surely there was not held such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;"
12,23,23,"But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah,"
12,23,24,"Moreover the mediums, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD."
12,23,25,"And like him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there"
12,23,26,"However the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations by which Manasseh had provoked him."
12,23,27,"And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there."
12,23,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did,"
12,23,29,"In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him."
12,23,30,"And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s stead."
12,23,31,"Jehoahaz"
12,23,32,"And he did"
12,23,33,"And Pharaohnechoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and subjected the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold."
12,23,34,"And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the stead of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there."
12,23,35,"And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold from the people of the land, from every one according to his assessment, to give"
12,23,36,"Jehoiakim"
12,23,37,"And he did"
12,24,1,"In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him."
12,24,2,"And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servants the prophets."
12,24,3,"Surely at the commandment of the LORD came"
12,24,4,"And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon."
12,24,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did,"
12,24,6,"So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead."
12,24,7,"And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt."
12,24,8,"Jehoiachin"
12,24,9,"And he did"
12,24,10,"At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged."
12,24,11,"And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants besieged it."
12,24,12,"And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign."
12,24,13,"And he carried out from there all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said."
12,24,14,"And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour,"
12,24,15,"And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land,"
12,24,16,"And all the men of might,"
12,24,17,"And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father’s brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah."
12,24,18,"Zedekiah"
12,24,19,"And he did"
12,24,20,"For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon."
12,25,1,"And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth"
12,25,2,"And the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah."
12,25,3,"And on the ninth"
12,25,4,"And the city was broken up, and all the men of war"
12,25,5,"And the army of the Chaldees pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him."
12,25,6,"So they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they pronounced sentence upon him."
12,25,7,"And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon."
12,25,8,"And in the fifth month, on the seventh"
12,25,9,"And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great"
12,25,10,"And all the army of the Chaldees, that"
12,25,11,"Now the rest of the people"
12,25,12,"But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land"
12,25,13,"And the pillars of brass that"
12,25,14,"And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass by which they ministered, they took away."
12,25,15,"And the firepans, and the basins,"
12,25,16,"The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was beyond weight."
12,25,17,"The height of the one pillar"
12,25,18,"And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:"
12,25,19,"And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king’s presence, who were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land"
12,25,20,"And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:"
12,25,21,"And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land."
12,25,22,"And"
12,25,23,"And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men."
12,25,24,"And Gedaliah swore to them, and to their men, and said to them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you."
12,25,25,"But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah."
12,25,26,"And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees."
12,25,27,"And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth"
12,25,28,"And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that"

13,11,4,"And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which"
13,11,5,"And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come here. Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion, which"
13,11,6,"And David said, Whoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was chief."
13,11,7,"And David dwelt in the strong hold; therefore they called it the city of David."
13,11,8,"And he built the city all around, even from Millo all around: and Joab repaired the rest of the city."
13,11,9,"So David became greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts"

13,13,4,"And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people."
13,13,5,"So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even to the entrance of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim."
13,13,6,"And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah,"

13,13,12,"And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God"
13,13,13,"So David brought not the ark to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite."
13,13,14,"And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had."
13,14,1,"Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house."
13,14,2,"And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted on high, because of his people Israel."

13,14,10,"And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said to him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand."
13,14,11,"So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon my enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim."
13,14,12,"And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire."
13,14,13,"And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley."
13,14,14,"Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said to him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them in front of the mulberry trees."
13,14,15,"And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then thou shalt go out to battle: for God hath gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines."
13,14,16,"David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer."
13,14,17,"And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations."
13,15,1,"And"
13,15,2,"Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister to him for ever."
13,15,3,"And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place, which he had prepared for it."
13,15,4,"And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:"
13,15,5,"Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:"
13,15,6,"Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:"
13,15,7,"Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:"
13,15,8,"Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:"

13,15,10,"Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve."
13,15,11,"And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,"
13,15,12,"And said to them, Ye"
13,15,13,"For because ye"
13,15,14,"So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel."
13,15,15,"And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staffs on it, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD."
13,15,16,"And David spoke to the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brethren"
13,15,17,"So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;"
13,15,18,"And with them their brethren of the second"
13,15,19,"So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan,"
13,15,20,"And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;"
13,15,21,"And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to lead."
13,15,22,"And Chenaniah, leader of the Levites,"
13,15,23,"And Berechiah and Elkanah"
13,15,24,"And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah"
13,15,25,"So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obededom with joy."
13,15,26,"And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bulls and seven rams."
13,15,27,"And David"
13,15,28,"Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps."
13,15,29,"And it came to pass,"
13,16,1,"So they brought the ark of God, and set it inside the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God."
13,16,2,"And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD."
13,16,3,"And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon"
13,16,4,"And he appointed"
13,16,5,"Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;"
13,16,6,"Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God."
13,16,7,"Then on that day David delivered first"
13,16,8,"Give thanks to the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people."
13,16,9,"Sing to him, sing psalms to him, talk ye of all his wondrous works."
13,16,10,"Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD."
13,16,11,"Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually."
13,16,12,"Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;"

13,17,2,"Then Nathan said to David, Do all that"
13,17,3,"And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,"
13,17,4,"Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:"
13,17,5,"For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from"
13,17,6,"Wherever I have walked with all Israel, have I spoken a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?"
13,17,7,"Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepfold,"
13,17,8,"And I have been with thee wherever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thy enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that"
13,17,9,"Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,"

13,17,11,"And it shall come to pass, when thy days shall be ended that thou must go"
13,17,12,"He shall build me an house, and I will establish his throne for ever."
13,17,13,"I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took"
13,17,14,"But I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore."
13,17,15,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David."
13,17,16,"And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who"
13,17,17,"And"
13,17,18,"What can David"
13,17,19,"O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thy own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all"

13,17,22,"For thy people Israel didst thou make thy own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God."
13,17,23,"Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said."
13,17,24,"Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts"

13,17,27,"Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and"
13,18,1,"Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines."
13,18,2,"And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants,"
13,18,3,"And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates."
13,18,4,"And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also hamstrung all the chariot"
13,18,5,"And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men."
13,18,6,"Then David put"
13,18,7,"And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem."
13,18,8,"Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David brought very much brass, with which Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass."
13,18,9,"Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;"
13,18,10,"He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had warred with Tou;) and"
13,18,11,"Them also king David dedicated to the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all"
13,18,12,"Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand."
13,18,13,"And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David’s servants. Thus the LORD preserved David wherever he went."
13,18,14,"So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people."
13,18,15,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah"
13,18,16,"And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar,"
13,18,17,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada"
13,19,1,"Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead."
13,19,2,"And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him."
13,19,3,"But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters to thee? are not his servants come to thee to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?"
13,19,4,"Therefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away."
13,19,5,"Then there went"
13,19,6,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah."
13,19,7,"So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle."
13,19,8,"And when David heard"
13,19,9,"And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that had come"
13,19,10,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose from all the best of Israel, and put"
13,19,11,"And the rest of the people he delivered to the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set"
13,19,12,"And he said, If the Syrians shall be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon shall be too strong for thee, then I will help thee."
13,19,13,"Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do"

13,21,17,"And David said to God,"
13,21,18,"Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and build an altar to the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite."

13,21,26,"And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering."

13,22,14,"Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a million talents of silver; and of brass and iron beyond weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add to them."
13,22,15,"Moreover"

13,29,23,"Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him."
13,29,24,"And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king."
13,29,25,"And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him"
13,29,26,"Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel."
13,29,27,"And the time that he reigned over Israel"
13,29,28,"And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead."

14,1,7,"In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give thee."
14,1,8,"And Solomon said to God, Thou hast shown great mercy to David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead."
14,1,9,"Now, O LORD God, let thy promise to David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude."
14,1,10,"Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy great people?"
14,1,11,"And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thy enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:"
14,1,12,"Wisdom and knowledge"
14,1,13,"Then Solomon came"
14,1,14,"And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem."
14,1,15,"And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem"
14,1,16,"And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price."
14,1,17,"And they fetched up, and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred"
14,2,1,"And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom."
14,2,2,"And Solomon numbered out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them."
14,2,3,"And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell in,"
14,2,4,"Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate"
14,2,5,"And the house which I build"
14,2,6,"But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who"
14,2,7,"Send me now therefore a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that hath skill to engrave with the skilful men that"
14,2,8,"Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants"
14,2,9,"Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build"
14,2,10,"And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil."
14,2,11,"Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them."
14,2,12,"Huram said moreover, Blessed"
14,2,13,"And now I have sent a skilful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father’s,"
14,2,14,"The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father"
14,2,15,"Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send to his servants:"
14,2,16,"And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou mayest convey it to Jerusalem."
14,2,17,"And Solomon numbered all the strangers that"
14,2,18,"And he set seventy thousand of them"

14,4,1,"Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length of it, and twenty cubits the breadth of it, and ten cubits the height of it."
14,4,2,"Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in shape, and five cubits the height of it; and a line of thirty cubits around it."
14,4,3,"And under it"

14,4,17,"In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah."
14,4,18,"Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be known."

14,10,18,"Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that"
14,10,19,"And Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day."
14,11,1,"And when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and eighty thousand chosen"
14,11,2,"But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,"
14,11,3,"Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,"
14,11,4,"Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done by me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam."
14,11,5,"And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah."
14,11,6,"He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,"
14,11,7,"And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,"
14,11,8,"And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,"
14,11,9,"And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,"
14,11,10,"And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which"
14,11,11,"And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of food, and of oil and wine."
14,11,12,"And in every single city"
14,11,13,"And the priests and the Levites that"
14,11,14,"For the Levites left their common lands and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest’s office to the LORD:"
14,11,15,"And he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the demons, and for the calves which he had made."
14,11,16,"And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers."
14,11,17,"So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon."
14,11,18,"And Rehoboam took to himself Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David for a wife,"
14,11,19,"Who bore him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham."
14,11,20,"And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; who bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith."
14,11,21,"And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and sixty concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and sixty daughters.)"
14,11,22,"And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief,"
14,11,23,"And he dealt wisely, and distributed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city: and he gave them food in abundance. And he desired many wives."
14,12,1,"And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him."
14,12,2,"And it came to pass,"
14,12,3,"With twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen: and the people"
14,12,4,"And he took the fortified cities which"
14,12,5,"Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and"
14,12,6,"Upon which the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD"
14,12,7,"And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves;"
14,12,8,"Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries."
14,12,9,"So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made."
14,12,10,"Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed"
14,12,11,"And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and conveyed them, and brought them again into the guard chamber."
14,12,12,"And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy"
14,12,13,"So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam"
14,12,14,"And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD."
14,12,15,"Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last,"
14,12,16,"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead."
14,13,1,"Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah."
14,13,2,"He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also"
14,13,3,"And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war,"
14,13,4,"And Abijah stood upon mount Zemaraim, which"
14,13,5,"Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever,"
14,13,6,"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, hath risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord."
14,13,7,"And there are gathered to him worthless men, base fellows, and"
14,13,8,"And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye"
14,13,9,"Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have appointed priests after the manner of the nations of"
14,13,10,"But as for us, the LORD"
14,13,11,"And they burn to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the showbread also"
14,13,12,"And, behold, God himself"
14,13,13,"But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambush"
14,13,14,"And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle"
14,13,15,"Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah."
14,13,16,"And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand."
14,13,17,"And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men."
14,13,18,"Thus the children of Israel were subdued at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers."
14,13,19,"And Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with its towns, and Jeshanah with its towns, and Ephrain with its towns."
14,13,20,"Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died."
14,13,21,"But Abijah became mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters."
14,13,22,"And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings,"
14,14,1,"So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years."
14,14,2,"And Asa did"
14,14,3,"For he took away the altars of the strange"
14,14,4,"And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment."
14,14,5,"Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him."
14,14,6,"And he built fortified cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest."
14,14,7,"Therefore he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about"
14,14,8,"And Asa had an army"
14,14,9,"And there came out against them Zerah the Cushite with an host of a million, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah."
14,14,10,"Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah."
14,14,11,"And Asa cried to the LORD his God, and said, LORD,"
14,14,12,"So the LORD smote the Cushites before Asa, and before Judah; and the Cushites fled."
14,14,13,"And Asa and the people that"
14,14,14,"And they smote all the cities about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they smote all the cities; for there was very much spoil in them."
14,14,15,"They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem."
14,15,1,"And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:"
14,15,2,"And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD"
14,15,3,"Now for a long season Israel"
14,15,4,"But when they in their trouble returned to the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them."
14,15,5,"And in those times"
14,15,6,"And nation was destroyed by nation, and city by city: for God troubled them with all adversity."
14,15,7,"Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded."
14,15,8,"And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and repaired the altar of the LORD, that"
14,15,9,"And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they resorted to him out of Israel in multitudes, when they saw that the LORD his God"
14,15,10,"So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa."
14,15,11,"And they offered to the LORD at the same time, of the spoil"
14,15,12,"And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;"
14,15,13,"That whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman."
14,15,14,"And they swore to the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets."
14,15,15,"And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found by them: and the LORD gave them rest on all sides."
14,15,16,"And also"
14,15,17,"But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days."
14,15,18,"And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels."
14,15,19,"And there was no"
14,16,1,"In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah."
14,16,2,"Then Asa brought silver and gold out of the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the king’s house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,"
14,16,3,""
14,16,4,"And Benhadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali."
14,16,5,"And it came to pass, when Baasha heard"
14,16,6,"Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it, with which Baasha was building; and he built with it Geba and Mizpah."
14,16,7,"And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore hath the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand."
14,16,8,"Were not the Cushites and the Lubims a huge army, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thy hand."
14,16,9,"For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of"
14,16,10,"Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for"
14,16,11,"And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they"
14,16,12,"And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease"
14,16,13,"And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign."
14,16,14,"And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and various kinds"
14,17,1,"And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel."
14,17,2,"And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken."
14,17,3,"And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not to Baalim;"
14,17,4,"But sought to the"
14,17,5,"Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had riches and honour in abundance."
14,17,6,"And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah."
14,17,7,"Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes,"
14,17,8,"And with them"
14,17,9,"And they taught in Judah, and"
14,17,10,"And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that"
14,17,11,"Also"
14,17,12,"And Jehoshaphat became exceedingly great; and he built in Judah fortresses, and cities of store."
14,17,13,"And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour,"
14,17,14,"And these"
14,17,15,"And next to him"
14,17,16,"And next to him"
14,17,17,"And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand."
14,17,18,"And next to him"
14,17,19,"These waited on the king, besides"
14,18,1,"Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and allied himself with Ahab by marriage."
14,18,2,"And after"
14,18,3,"And Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I"
14,18,4,"And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day."
14,18,5,"Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver"
14,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat said,"
14,18,7,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat,"
14,18,8,"And the king of Israel called for one"
14,18,9,"And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat each of them on his throne, clothed in"
14,18,10,"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they shall be consumed."
14,18,11,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver"
14,18,12,"And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets"
14,18,13,"And Micaiah said,"
14,18,14,"And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand."
14,18,15,"And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?"
14,18,16,"Then he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return"
14,18,17,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee"
14,18,18,"Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and"
14,18,19,"And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner."
14,18,20,"Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said to him, How?"
14,18,21,"And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And"
14,18,22,"Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee."
14,18,23,"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to thee?"
14,18,24,"And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself."
14,18,25,"Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;"
14,18,26,"And say, Thus saith the king, Put this"
14,18,27,"And Micaiah said, If thou shalt certainly return in peace,"
14,18,28,"So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead."
14,18,29,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle."
14,18,30,"Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that"
14,18,31,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It"
14,18,32,"For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him."
14,18,33,"And a"
14,18,34,"And the battle increased that day: yet the king of Israel held"
14,19,1,"And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem."
14,19,2,"And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the wicked, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore"
14,19,3,"Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thy heart to seek God."
14,19,4,"And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back to the LORD God of their fathers."
14,19,5,"And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,"
14,19,6,"And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who"
14,19,7,"Therefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do"
14,19,8,"Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and"
14,19,9,"And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart."
14,19,10,"And whatever cause shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and"
14,19,11,"And, behold, Amariah the chief priest"
14,20,1,"It came to pass after this also,"
14,20,2,"Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side of Syria; and, behold, they"
14,20,3,"And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah."
14,20,4,"And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask"
14,20,5,"And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,"
14,20,6,"And said, O LORD God of our fathers,"
14,20,7,""
14,20,8,"And they dwelt in it, and have built thee a sanctuary in it for thy name, saying,"
14,20,9,"If,"
14,20,10,"And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came from the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;"
14,20,11,"Behold,"
14,20,12,"O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes"
14,20,13,"And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children."
14,20,14,"Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;"
14,20,15,"And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD to you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle"
14,20,16,"To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel."
14,20,17,"Ye shall not"
14,20,18,"And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with"
14,20,19,"And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high."
14,20,20,"And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper."
14,20,21,"And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers to the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy"
14,20,22,"And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, who were come against Judah; and they were smitten."
14,20,23,"For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy"
14,20,24,"And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked to the multitude, and, behold, they"
14,20,25,"And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering the spoil, it was so much."
14,20,26,"And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place hath been called, The valley of Berachah, to this day."
14,20,27,"Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the front of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies."
14,20,28,"And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets to the house of the LORD."
14,20,29,"And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of"
14,20,30,"So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest on all sides."
14,20,31,"And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah:"
14,20,32,"And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing"
14,20,33,"But the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts to the God of their fathers."
14,20,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they"
14,20,35,"And after this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:"
14,20,36,"And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongeber."
14,20,37,"Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish."
14,21,1,"Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead."
14,21,2,"And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these"
14,21,3,"And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom he gave to Jehoram; because he"
14,21,4,"Now when Jehoram had risen to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and"
14,21,5,"Jehoram"
14,21,6,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab for a wife: and he wrought"
14,21,7,"Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever."
14,21,8,"In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king."
14,21,9,"Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites who surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots."
14,21,10,"So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. The same time"
14,21,11,"Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, and compelled Judah to"
14,21,12,"And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,"

14,21,15,"And thou"
14,21,16,"Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that"
14,21,17,"And they came up into Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was not a son left to him, except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons."
14,21,18,"And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease."
14,21,19,"And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of grievous diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers."
14,21,20,"Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Yet they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings."
14,22,1,"And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned."
14,22,2,"Forty and two years old"
14,22,3,"He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly."
14,22,4,"Therefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction."
14,22,5,"He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram."
14,22,6,"And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick."
14,22,7,"And the destruction of Ahaziah was from God by coming to Joram: for when he had come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab."
14,22,8,"And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them."
14,22,9,"And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he"
14,22,10,"But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah."
14,22,11,"But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not."
14,22,12,"And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land."
14,23,1,"And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him."
14,23,2,"And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem."
14,23,3,"And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David."
14,23,4,"This"
14,23,5,"And a third part"
14,23,6,"But let none come into the house of the LORD, except the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they"
14,23,7,"And the Levites shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever"
14,23,8,"So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go"
14,23,9,"Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that"
14,23,10,"And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king on all sides."
14,23,11,"Then they brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the crown, and"
14,23,12,"Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:"
14,23,13,"And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entrance, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason."
14,23,14,"Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said to them, Have her forth between the ranks: and whoever followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD."
14,23,15,"So they laid hands on her; and when she had come to the entrance of the horse gate by the king’s house, they slew her there."
14,23,16,"And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD’S people."
14,23,17,"Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars."
14,23,18,"Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as"
14,23,19,"And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none"
14,23,20,"And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king’s house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom."
14,23,21,"And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after they had slain Athaliah with the sword."
14,24,1,"Joash"
14,24,2,"And Joash did"
14,24,3,"And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters."
14,24,4,"And it came to pass after this,"
14,24,5,"And he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. But the Levites hastened"
14,24,6,"And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection,"
14,24,7,"For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD they bestowed upon Baalim."
14,24,8,"And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD."
14,24,9,"And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection"
14,24,10,"And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had finished."
14,24,11,"Now it came to pass, that at the time the chest was brought to the king’s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that"
14,24,12,"And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD."
14,24,13,"So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in order, and strengthened it."
14,24,14,"And when they had finished"
14,24,15,"But Jehoiada grew old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old"
14,24,16,"And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house."
14,24,17,"Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened to them."
14,24,18,"And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass."
14,24,19,"Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again to the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear."
14,24,20,"And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people, and said to them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you."
14,24,21,"And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD."
14,24,22,"Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon"
14,24,23,"And it came to pass at the end of the year,"
14,24,24,"For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash."
14,24,25,"And when they had departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings."
14,24,26,"And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess."
14,24,27,"Now"
14,25,1,"Amaziah"
14,25,2,"And he did"
14,25,3,"Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father."
14,25,4,"But he slew not their children, but"
14,25,5,"Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of"
14,25,6,"He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver."
14,25,7,"But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD"
14,25,8,"But if thou wilt go, do"
14,25,9,"And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this."
14,25,10,"Then Amaziah separated them,"
14,25,11,"And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand."
14,25,12,"And"
14,25,13,"But the soldiers of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil."
14,25,14,"Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up"
14,25,15,"Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thy hand?"
14,25,16,"And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that"
14,25,17,"Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face."
14,25,18,"And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that"
14,25,19,"Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thy heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to"
14,25,20,"But Amaziah would not hear; for it"
14,25,21,"So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they looked one another in the face,"
14,25,22,"And Judah was smote before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent."
14,25,23,"And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits."
14,25,24,"And"
14,25,25,"And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years."
14,25,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold,"
14,25,27,"Now after the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there."
14,25,28,"And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah."
14,26,1,"Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who"
14,26,2,"He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers."
14,26,3,"Sixteen years old"
14,26,4,"And he did"
14,26,5,"And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper."
14,26,6,"And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines."
14,26,7,"And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims."
14,26,8,"And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad"
14,26,9,"Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning"
14,26,10,"Also he built towers in the desert, and dug many wells: for he had many cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: farmers"
14,26,11,"Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah,"
14,26,12,"The whole number of the heads of the father’s"
14,26,13,"And under their hand"
14,26,14,"And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the army shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and slings"
14,26,15,"And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong."
14,26,16,"But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to"
14,26,17,"And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of the LORD,"
14,26,18,"And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him,"
14,26,19,"Then Uzziah was angry, and"
14,26,20,"And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he"
14,26,21,"And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house,"
14,26,22,"Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, were written by Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz."
14,26,23,"So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which"
14,27,1,"Jotham"
14,27,2,"And he did"
14,27,3,"He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much."
14,27,4,"Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers."
14,27,5,"He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay to him, both the second year, and the third."
14,27,6,"So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God."
14,27,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, see, they"
14,27,8,"He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem."
14,27,9,"And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead."
14,28,1,"Ahaz"
14,28,2,"For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim."
14,28,3,"Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel."
14,28,4,"He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree."
14,28,5,"Therefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought"
14,28,6,"For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day,"
14,28,7,"And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah"
14,28,8,"And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and also took away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria."
14,28,9,"But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name"
14,28,10,"And now ye purpose to bring into bondage for yourselves the children of Judah and Jerusalem for male and female slaves:"
14,28,11,"Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD"
14,28,12,"Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,"
14,28,13,"And said to them, Ye shall not bring in the captives here: for though we have offended against the LORD"
14,28,14,"So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation."
14,28,15,"And the men who were mentioned by name arose, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them food and drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria."
14,28,16,"At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him."
14,28,17,"For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives."
14,28,18,"The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with its villages, and Timnah with its villages, Gimzo also and its villages: and they dwelt there."
14,28,19,"For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and greatly transgressed against the LORD."
14,28,20,"And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not."
14,28,21,"For Ahaz took away a portion from the house of the LORD, and from the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave"
14,28,22,"And in the time of his distress he trespassed yet more against the LORD: this"
14,28,23,"For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them,"
14,28,24,"And Ahaz gathered the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem."
14,28,25,"And in every single city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers."
14,28,26,"Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they"
14,28,27,"And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city,"
14,29,1,"Hezekiah began to reign"
14,29,2,"And he did"
14,29,3,"He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them."
14,29,4,"And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them in the east street,"
14,29,5,"And said to them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy"
14,29,6,"For our fathers have trespassed, and done"
14,29,7,"Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy"
14,29,8,"Therefore the wrath of the LORD hath been upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes."
14,29,9,"For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives"
14,29,10,"Now"
14,29,11,"My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister to him, and burn incense."
14,29,12,"Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:"
14,29,13,"And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:"
14,29,14,"And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel."
14,29,15,"And they assembled their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD."
14,29,16,"And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse"
14,29,17,"Now they began on the first"
14,29,18,"Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels, and the showbread table, with all its vessels."
14,29,19,"Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they"
14,29,20,"Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and assembled the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD."
14,29,21,"And they brought seven bulls, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven male goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer"
14,29,22,"So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled"
14,29,23,"And they brought forth the male goats"
14,29,24,"And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded"
14,29,25,"And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet: for"
14,29,26,"And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets."
14,29,27,"And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began"
14,29,28,"And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded:"
14,29,29,"And when they had finished offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped."
14,29,30,"Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise to the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped."
14,29,31,"Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings."
14,29,32,"And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was seventy bulls, an hundred rams,"
14,29,33,"And the consecrated things"
14,29,34,"But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: therefore their brethren the Levites helped them, till the work was ended, and until the"
14,29,35,"And also the burnt offerings"
14,29,36,"And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was"
14,30,1,"And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel."
14,30,2,"For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month."
14,30,3,"For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together at Jerusalem."
14,30,4,"And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation."
14,30,5,"So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done"
14,30,6,"So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria."
14,30,7,"And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers,"
14,30,8,"Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers"
14,30,9,"For if ye turn again to the LORD, your brethren and your children"
14,30,10,"So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even to Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them."
14,30,11,"Nevertheless some from Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem."
14,30,12,"Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD."
14,30,13,"And there assembled at Jerusalem many people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation."
14,30,14,"And they arose and took away the altars that"
14,30,15,"Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth"
14,30,16,"And they stood in their place after their custom, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood,"

14,30,20,"And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people."
14,30,21,"And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day,"
14,30,22,"And Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers."
14,30,23,"And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept"
14,30,24,"For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the congregation a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves."
14,30,25,"And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came from the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced."
14,30,26,"So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel"
14,30,27,"Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer ascended to his holy dwelling place,"
14,31,1,"Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities."
14,31,2,"And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of the LORD."
14,31,3,""
14,31,4,"Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD."
14,31,5,"And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of grain, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all"
14,31,6,"And the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to the LORD their God, and laid"
14,31,7,"In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished"
14,31,8,"And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel."
14,31,9,"Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps."
14,31,10,"And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since"
14,31,11,"Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared"

14,32,1,"After these things, and their establishment, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself."
14,32,2,"And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that he purposed to fight against Jerusalem,"
14,32,3,"He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which"
14,32,4,"So there was gathered many people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?"
14,32,5,"Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised"
14,32,6,"And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and encouraged them, saying,"
14,32,7,"Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that"

14,32,9,"After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem, (but he"
14,32,10,"Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, On what do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?"
14,32,11,"Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?"
14,32,12,"Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?"
14,32,13,"Know ye not what I and my fathers have done to all the people of"
14,32,14,"Who"
14,32,15,"Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom hath been able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?"
14,32,16,"And his servants spoke yet"
14,32,17,"He wrote also letters to rail at the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of"
14,32,18,"Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ speech to the people of Jerusalem that"
14,32,19,"And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, the work of the hands of man."
14,32,20,"And for this"
14,32,21,"And the LORD sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he had come into the house of his god, they that came forth from his own bowels slew him there with the sword."
14,32,22,"Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all"
14,32,23,"And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that from then on he was magnified in the sight of all nations."
14,32,24,"In those days Hezekiah was sick and near to death, and he prayed to the LORD: and he spoke to him, and he gave him a sign."
14,32,25,"But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit"
14,32,26,"However Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart,"
14,32,27,"And Hezekiah had very great riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;"
14,32,28,"Storehouses also for the increase of grain, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and sheepfolds for flocks."
14,32,29,"Moreover he provided for himself cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance in great abundance."
14,32,30,"This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works."
14,32,31,"But in"
14,32,32,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they"
14,32,33,"And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chief of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead."
14,33,1,"Manasseh"
14,33,2,"But did"
14,33,3,"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them."
14,33,4,"Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever."
14,33,5,"And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD."
14,33,6,"And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a medium, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger."
14,33,7,"And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:"
14,33,8,"Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers; provided they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses."
14,33,9,"So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err,"
14,33,10,"And the LORD spoke to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken."
14,33,11,"Therefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon."
14,33,12,"And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,"
14,33,13,"And prayed to him: and he was entreated by him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he"
14,33,14,"Now after this he built a wall outside the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate, and surrounded Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fortified cities of Judah."
14,33,15,"And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast"
14,33,16,"And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed on it peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel."
14,33,17,"Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places,"
14,33,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they"
14,33,19,"His prayer also, and"
14,33,20,"So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead."
14,33,21,"Amon"
14,33,22,"But he did"
14,33,23,"And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more."
14,33,24,"And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house."
14,33,25,"But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead."
14,34,1,"Josiah"
14,34,2,"And he did"
14,34,3,"For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images."
14,34,4,"And they broke down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that"
14,34,5,"And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem."
14,34,6,"And"
14,34,7,"And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem."
14,34,8,"Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God."
14,34,9,"And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had assembled from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem."
14,34,10,"And they put"
14,34,11,"Even to the craftsmen and builders they gave"
14,34,12,"And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them"
14,34,13,"Also"
14,34,14,"And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the LORD"
14,34,15,"And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan."
14,34,16,"And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they are doing."
14,34,17,"And they have gathered the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen."
14,34,18,"Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king."
14,34,19,"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he tore his clothes."
14,34,20,"And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king’s, saying,"
14,34,21,"Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great"
14,34,22,"And Hilkiah, and"
14,34,23,"And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,"
14,34,24,"Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants,"
14,34,25,"Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched."
14,34,26,"And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel"
14,34,27,"Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou didst hear his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and didst humble thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard"
14,34,28,"Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thy eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again."
14,34,29,"Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem."
14,34,30,"And the king went into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD."
14,34,31,"And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book."
14,34,32,"And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand"
14,34,33,"And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that"
14,35,1,"Moreover Josiah kept a passover to the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth"
14,35,2,"And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,"
14,35,3,"And said to the Levites that taught all Israel, who were holy to the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built;"
14,35,4,"And prepare"
14,35,5,"And stand in the holy"
14,35,6,"So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that"
14,35,7,"And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand cattle: these"
14,35,8,"And his princes gave willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred"
14,35,9,"Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave to the Levites for passover offerings five thousand"
14,35,10,"So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king’s commandment."
14,35,11,"And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled"
14,35,12,"And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer to the LORD, as"
14,35,13,"And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the"
14,35,14,"And afterwards they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron"
14,35,15,"And the singers the sons of Asaph"
14,35,16,"So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah."
14,35,17,"And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days."
14,35,18,"And there was no passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
14,35,19,"In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept."
14,35,20,"After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him."
14,35,21,"But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah?"
14,35,22,"Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo."
14,35,23,"And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Take me away; for I am grievously wounded."
14,35,24,"His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in"
14,35,25,"And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women have spoken of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they"
14,35,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to"
14,35,27,"And his deeds, first and last, behold, they"
14,36,1,"Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem."
14,36,2,"Jehoahaz"
14,36,3,"And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and imposed a fine on the land of an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold."
14,36,4,"And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt."
14,36,5,"Jehoiakim"
14,36,6,"Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon."
14,36,7,"Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon."
14,36,8,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they"
14,36,9,"Jehoiachin"
14,36,10,"And when the year had ended, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem."
14,36,11,"Zedekiah"
14,36,12,"And he did"
14,36,13,"And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning to the LORD God of Israel."
14,36,14,"Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem."
14,36,15,"And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up early, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:"
14,36,16,"But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till"
14,36,17,"Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave"
14,36,18,"And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all"
14,36,19,"And they burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious vessels."
14,36,20,"And them that had escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:"
14,36,21,"To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths:"
14,36,22,"Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD"

16,2,5,"And I said to the king, If it should please the king, and if thy servant hath found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it."
16,2,6,"And the king said to me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time."
16,2,7,"Moreover I said to the king, If it should please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may let me pass through till I come into Judah;"

16,2,11,"So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days."
16,2,12,"And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I"
16,2,13,"And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and their gates were consumed with fire."
16,2,14,"Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king’s pool: but"
16,2,15,"Then I went up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and"

16,2,20,"Then I answered them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem."
16,3,1,"Then Eliashib the high priest arose with his brethren the priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even to the tower of Meah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananeel."

16,3,20,"After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece, from the turning"
16,3,21,"After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib."

16,3,32,"And between the ascent of the corner to the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants."
16,4,1,"But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry, and felt great indignation, and mocked the Jews."
16,4,2,"And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they finish in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?"
16,4,3,"Now Tobiah the Ammonite"
16,4,4,"Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a spoil in the land of captivity:"
16,4,5,"And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked"
16,4,6,"So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to the half of it: for the people had a mind to work."
16,4,7,"But it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were set up,"
16,4,8,"And conspired all of them together to come"
16,4,9,"Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them."
16,4,10,"And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is failing, and"
16,4,11,"And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease."
16,4,12,"And it came to pass, that when the Jews who dwelt by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places where ye shall return to us"
16,4,13,"Therefore I set in the lower places behind the wall,"
16,4,14,"And I looked, and arose, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be ye not afraid of them: remember the Lord,"
16,4,15,"And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one to his work."
16,4,16,"And it came to pass from that time forth,"
16,4,17,"They who built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, burdened themselves,"
16,4,18,"For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and"
16,4,19,"And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work"
16,4,20,"In what place"
16,4,21,"So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared."
16,4,22,"Likewise at the same time said I to the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour in the day."
16,4,23,"So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes,"
16,5,1,"And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews."
16,5,2,"For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters,"
16,5,3,""
16,5,4,"There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s tax,"
16,5,5,"Yet now our flesh"
16,5,6,"And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words."
16,5,7,"Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact interest, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them."
16,5,8,"And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold to the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold to us? Then they held their peace, and found nothing"
16,5,9,"Also I said, That"
16,5,10,"I likewise, my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and grain: I pray you, let us stop charging interest."
16,5,11,"Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth"
16,5,12,"Then said they, We will restore"
16,5,13,"Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise."
16,5,14,"Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king,"
16,5,15,"But the former governors that"
16,5,16,"Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants"
16,5,17,"Moreover"
16,5,18,"Now"
16,5,19,"Think upon me, my God, for good,"
16,6,1,"Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and"
16,6,2,"That Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in"
16,6,3,"And I sent messengers to them, saying, I"
16,6,4,"Yet they sent to me four times in this way; and I answered them after the same manner."
16,6,5,"Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;"
16,6,6,"In which"
16,6,7,"And thou hast also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning thee at Jerusalem, saying,"
16,6,8,"Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou maketh up them out of thy own heart."
16,6,9,"For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it may not be done. Now therefore,"
16,6,10,"Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who"
16,6,11,"And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who"
16,6,12,"And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."
16,6,13,"Therefore"
16,6,14,"My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear."
16,6,15,"So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth"
16,6,16,"And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard"
16,6,17,"Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and"
16,6,18,"For"
16,6,19,"Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him."
16,7,1,"Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,"
16,7,2,"That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he"
16,7,3,"And I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun shall be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar"
16,7,4,"Now the city"
16,7,5,"And my God put into my heart to gather the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a family record of the genealogy of them who came up at the first, and found written in it,"
16,7,6,"These"
16,7,7,"Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number,"

16,9,15,"And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and didst promise them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them."
16,9,16,"But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,"
16,9,17,"And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst perform among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou"
16,9,18,"Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This"
16,9,19,"Yet thou in thy great mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go."
16,9,20,"Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst."
16,9,21,"Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness,"
16,9,22,"Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."
16,9,23,"Their children also didst multiply thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou didst promise to their fathers, that they should go in to possess"
16,9,24,"So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou didst subdue before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would."
16,9,25,"And they took strong cities, and a rich land, and possessed houses full of all goods, dug wells, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness."
16,9,26,"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets who testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations."
16,9,27,"Therefore thou didst deliver them into the hand of their enemies, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to thee, thou heardest"
16,9,28,"But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried to thee, thou heardest"
16,9,29,"And didst testify against them, that thou mightest bring them again to thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not to thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man doeth, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear."
16,9,30,"Yet many years didst thou forbear over them, and didst testify against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not listen: therefore thou gavest them into the hand of the people of the lands."
16,9,31,"Nevertheless for thy great mercies’ sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou"
16,9,32,"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day."
16,9,33,"But thou"
16,9,34,"Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened to thy commandments and thy testimonies, with which thou didst testify against them."
16,9,35,"For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and rich land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works."
16,9,36,"Behold, we"
16,9,37,"And it yieldeth much increase to the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we"

16,13,12,"Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries."
16,13,13,"And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them"
16,13,14,"Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its offices."
16,13,15,"In those days I saw in Judah"

16,13,19,"And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and I set"

16,13,21,"Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why lodge ye before the wall? if ye do"
16,13,22,"And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and"

16,13,24,"And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people."
16,13,25,"And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God,"
16,13,26,"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin."
16,13,27,"Shall we then hearken to you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying foreign women?"
16,13,28,"And"
16,13,29,"Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites."
16,13,30,"Thus I cleansed them from all strangers, and appointed the duties of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;"

17,1,20,"And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be proclaimed throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small."
17,1,21,"And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:"

17,3,14,"The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was proclaimed to all people, that they should be ready for that day."
17,3,15,"The posts departed, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed."
17,4,1,"When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;"
17,4,2,"And came even before the king’s gate: for none"
17,4,3,"And in every province, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came,"
17,4,4,"So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told"
17,4,5,"Then called Esther for Hatach,"
17,4,6,"So Hatach went forth to Mordecai to the street of the city, which"
17,4,7,"And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them."
17,4,8,"Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show"
17,4,9,"And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai."
17,4,10,"Again Esther spoke to Hatach, and gave him commandment to Mordecai;"
17,4,11,"All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whoever, whether man or woman, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called,"
17,4,12,"And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words."
17,4,13,"Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews."
17,4,14,"For if thou shalt altogether hold thy peace at this time,"
17,4,15,"Then Esther told"
17,4,16,"Go, gather all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in to the king, which"
17,4,17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him."
17,5,1,"Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on"
17,5,2,"And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court,"
17,5,3,"Then said the king to her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what"
17,5,4,"And Esther answered, If"
17,5,5,"Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared."
17,5,6,"And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What"
17,5,7,"Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request"
17,5,8,"If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it shall please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said."
17,5,9,"Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor trembled before him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai."
17,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman restrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife."
17,5,11,"And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all"
17,5,12,"Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow I am invited to her also with the king."
17,5,13,"Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate."
17,5,14,"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou to the king that Mordecai may be hanged on it: then go thou in merrily with the king to the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made."
17,6,1,"In that night the king could not sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king."
17,6,2,"And it was found written, that Mordecai had informed on Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus."
17,6,3,"And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been bestowed upon Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered to him, There is nothing done for him."
17,6,4,"And the king said, Who"
17,6,5,"And the king’s servants said to him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in."
17,6,6,"So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?"
17,6,7,"And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,"
17,6,8,"Let the royal apparel be brought which the king"
17,6,9,"And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour."
17,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman, Make haste,"
17,6,11,"Then Haman took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour."
17,6,12,"And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered."
17,6,13,"And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every"
17,6,14,"And while they"
17,7,1,"So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen."
17,7,2,"And the king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What"
17,7,3,"Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it shall please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:"
17,7,4,"For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for male and female slaves, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not compensate for the king’s loss."
17,7,5,"Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that dared presume in his heart to do so?"
17,7,6,"And Esther said, The adversary and enemy"
17,7,7,"And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath"
17,7,8,"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen upon the couch on which Esther"
17,7,9,"And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him on it."
17,7,10,"So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified."
17,8,1,"On that day the king Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman the Jews’ enemy to Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he"
17,8,2,"And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."
17,8,3,"And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his plot that he had devised against the Jews."
17,8,4,"Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,"
17,8,5,"And said, If it shall please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing"
17,8,6,"For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come to my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?"
17,8,7,"Then the king Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews."
17,8,8,"Write ye also for the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king’s name, and seal"
17,8,9,"Then were the king’s scribes called at that time in the third month, that"
17,8,10,"And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus’ name, and sealed"
17,8,11,"In which the king granted the Jews who"

17,8,15,"And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad."
17,8,16,"The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour."
17,8,17,"And in every province, and in every city, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them."
17,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month, that"
17,9,2,"The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their harm: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people."
17,9,3,"And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them."
17,9,4,"For Mordecai"
17,9,5,"Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would to those that hated them."
17,9,6,"And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men."
17,9,7,"And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,"
17,9,8,"And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,"
17,9,9,"And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,"
17,9,10,"The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, they slew; but on the spoil they laid not their hand."
17,9,11,"On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king."
17,9,12,"And the king said to Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what"
17,9,13,"Then said Esther, If it shall please the king, let it be granted to the Jews who"

17,9,23,"And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written to them;"
17,9,24,"Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that"

17,9,31,"To confirm these days of Purim in their times"
17,9,32,"And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book."

18,1,1,"There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name"
18,1,2,"And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters."
18,1,3,"His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east."

18,1,8,"And the LORD said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that"
18,1,9,"Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nothing?"
18,1,10,"Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land."
18,1,11,"But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face."
18,1,12,"And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath"

18,2,6,"And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, he"
18,2,7,"So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with severe boils from the sole of his foot to his crown."
18,2,8,"And he took a potsherd to scrape himself with; and he sat down among the ashes."
18,2,9,"Then said his wife to him, Dost thou still retain thy integrity? curse God, and die."
18,2,10,"But he said to her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips."
18,2,11,"Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him."
18,2,12,"And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they raised their voice, and wept; and they tore every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven."
18,2,13,"So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him: for they saw that"

23,7,2,"And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest are moved with the wind."
23,7,3,"Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field;"
23,7,4,"And say to him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah."
23,7,5,"Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,"
23,7,6,"Let us go up against Judah, and trouble it, and let us conquer it for ourselves and set a king in the midst of it,"
23,7,7,"Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass."
23,7,8,"For the head of Syria"
23,7,9,"And the head of Ephraim"
23,7,10,"Moreover the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,"
23,7,11,"Ask thee a sign from the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above."
23,7,12,"But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD."
23,7,13,"And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David;"
23,7,14,"Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."
23,7,15,"Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good."
23,7,16,"For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken by both her kings."
23,7,17,"The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah;"
23,7,18,"And it shall come to pass in that day,"
23,7,19,"And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes."
23,7,20,"In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired,"
23,7,21,"And it shall come to pass in that day,"
23,7,22,"And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk"
23,7,23,"And it shall come to pass in that day,"
23,7,24,"With arrows and with bows shall"
23,7,25,"And"
23,8,1,"Moreover the LORD said to me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man’s pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz."
23,8,2,"And I took to me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah."
23,8,3,"And I went to the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz."
23,8,4,"For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria."
23,8,5,"The LORD spoke also to me again, saying,"
23,8,6,"Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;"
23,8,7,"Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many,"
23,8,8,"And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach"
23,8,9,"Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces."
23,8,10,"Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God"
23,8,11,"For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,"
23,8,12,"Say ye not, A confederacy, to all"
23,8,13,"Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and"
23,8,14,"And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a trap and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
23,8,15,"And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be ensnared, and be taken."
23,8,16,"Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples."
23,8,17,"And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him."
23,8,18,"Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me"
23,8,19,"And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that are mediums, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?"
23,8,20,"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word,"
23,8,21,"And they shall pass through it, distressed and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall be enraged, and curse their king and their God, and look upward."
23,8,22,"And they shall look to the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and"
23,9,1,"Nevertheless the dimness"
23,9,2,"The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined."
23,9,3,"Thou hast multiplied the nation,"
23,9,4,"For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian."
23,9,5,"For every battle of the warrior"
23,9,6,"For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."
23,9,7,"Of the increase of"
23,9,8,"The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel."
23,9,9,"And all the people shall know,"
23,9,10,"The bricks have fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycamores are cut down, but we will change"
23,9,11,"Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;"
23,9,12,"The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand"
23,9,13,"For the people turn not to him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts."
23,9,14,"Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day."
23,9,15,"The ancient and honourable, he"
23,9,16,"For the leaders of this people cause"
23,9,17,"Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one"
23,9,18,"For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up"
23,9,19,"Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother."
23,9,20,"And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:"
23,9,21,"Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh:"
23,10,1,"Woe to them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness"
23,10,2,"To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and"
23,10,3,"And what will ye do in the day of punishment, and in the desolation"
23,10,4,"Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand"
23,10,5,"O Assyrian, the rod of my anger, and the staff in their hand is my indignation."
23,10,6,"I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I command him, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets."
23,10,7,"Yet he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but"
23,10,8,"For he saith,"
23,10,9,""
23,10,10,"As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images excelled them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;"
23,10,11,"Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?"
23,10,12,"Therefore it shall come to pass,"
23,10,13,"For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done"
23,10,14,"And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs"
23,10,15,"Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth with it?"
23,10,16,"Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire."
23,10,17,"And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;"
23,10,18,"And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth."
23,10,19,"And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them."
23,10,20,"And it shall come to pass in that day,"
23,10,21,"The remnant shall return,"
23,10,22,"For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea,"
23,10,23,"For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a full end, even determined, in the midst of all the land."
23,10,24,"Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt."
23,10,25,"For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and my anger in their destruction."
23,10,26,"And the LORD of hosts shall raise up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and"
23,10,27,"And it shall come to pass in that day,"
23,10,28,"He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath attended to his carriages:"
23,10,29,"They have gone over the pass: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul hath fled."
23,10,30,"Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard to Laish, O poor Anathoth."
23,10,31,"Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee."

23,11,1,"And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:"
23,11,2,"And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;"
23,11,3,"And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:"
23,11,4,"But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked."
23,11,5,"And righteousness shall be the belt of his loins, and faithfulness the belt of his reins."
23,11,6,"The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them."

23,11,10,"And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious."
23,11,11,"And it shall come to pass in that day,"
23,11,12,"And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth."
23,11,13,"The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not distress Ephraim."
23,11,14,"But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them."

24,10,19,"Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this"
24,10,20,"My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they"
24,10,21,"For the pastors have become stupid, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered."
24,10,22,"Behold, the sound of a rumour is come, and a great commotion from the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate,"
24,10,23,"O LORD, I know that the way of man"
24,10,24,"O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thy anger, lest thou bring me to nothing."
24,10,25,"Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate."
24,11,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"
24,11,2,"Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;"
24,11,3,"And say thou to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed"
24,11,4,"Which I commanded your fathers in the day"
24,11,5,"That I may perform the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as"
24,11,6,"Then the LORD said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them."
24,11,7,"For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day"
24,11,8,"Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded"
24,11,9,"And the LORD said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
24,11,10,"They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers."
24,11,11,"Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry to me, I will not hearken to them."
24,11,12,"Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry to the gods to which they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble."
24,11,13,"For"
24,11,14,"Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear"
24,11,15,"What hath my beloved to do in my house,"
24,11,16,"The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair,"
24,11,17,"For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense to Baal."
24,11,18,"And the LORD hath given me knowledge"
24,11,19,"But I"
24,11,20,"But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for to thee have I revealed my cause."
24,11,21,"Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand:"
24,11,22,"Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:"
24,11,23,"And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth,"
24,12,1,"Righteous"
24,12,2,"Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou"
24,12,3,"But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried my heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter."
24,12,4,"How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell in it? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end."
24,12,5,"If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and"
24,12,6,"For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words to thee."
24,12,7,"I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies."
24,12,8,"My heritage is to me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it."
24,12,9,"My heritage"
24,12,10,"Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness."
24,12,11,"They have made it desolate,"
24,12,12,"The spoilers have come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the"
24,12,13,"They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain,"
24,12,14,"Thus saith the LORD against all my evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them."
24,12,15,"And it shall come to pass, after I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land."
24,12,16,"And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people."
24,12,17,"But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD."
24,13,1,"Thus saith the LORD to me, Go and purchase a linen waistband, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water."
24,13,2,"So I bought a waistband according to the word of the LORD, and put"
24,13,3,"And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying,"
24,13,4,"Take the waistband that thou hast bought, which"
24,13,5,"So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me."
24,13,6,"And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said to me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the waistband from there, which I commanded thee to hide there."
24,13,7,"Then I went to Euphrates, and dug, and took the waistband from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the waistband was marred, it was profitable for nothing."
24,13,8,"Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
24,13,9,"Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem."
24,13,10,"This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this waistband, which is good for nothing."
24,13,11,"For as the waistband cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear."
24,13,12,"Therefore thou shalt speak to them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say to thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?"
24,13,13,"Then shalt thou say to them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness."
24,13,14,"And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them."
24,13,15,"Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken."
24,13,16,"Give glory to the LORD your God, before he shall cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he shall turn it into the shadow of death,"
24,13,17,"But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for"
24,13,18,"Say to the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down,"
24,13,19,"The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open"
24,13,20,"Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where"
24,13,21,"What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them"
24,13,22,"And if thou shalt say in thy heart, Why come these things upon me? For the greatness of thy iniquity are thy skirts uncovered,"
24,13,23,"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?"
24,13,24,"Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness."
24,13,25,"This"
24,13,26,"Therefore will I uncover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear."
24,13,27,"I have seen thy adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy harlotry,"
24,14,1,"The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth."
24,14,2,"Judah mourneth, and her gates languish; they are black to the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up."
24,14,3,"And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits,"
24,14,4,"Because the ground is parched, for there was no rain on the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads."
24,14,5,"Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook"
24,14,6,"And the wild donkeys stood in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes failed, because"
24,14,7,"O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou"
24,14,8,"O the hope of Israel, his saviour in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man"
24,14,9,"Why shouldest thou be as a man dismayed, as a mighty man"
24,14,10,"Thus saith the LORD to this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not restrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and punish their sins."
24,14,11,"Then said the LORD to me, Pray not for this people for"
24,14,12,"When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence."
24,14,13,"Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say to them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place."
24,14,14,"Then the LORD said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I have not sent them, neither have I commanded them, neither spoken to them: they prophesy to you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart."
24,14,15,"Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed."
24,14,16,"And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them."
24,14,17,"Therefore thou shalt say this word to them; Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow."
24,14,18,"If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not."
24,14,19,"Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul abhorred Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and"
24,14,20,"We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness,"
24,14,21,"Do not abhor"
24,14,22,"Are there"
24,15,1,"Then said the LORD to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me,"
24,15,2,"And it shall come to pass, if they say to thee, Where shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as"
24,15,3,"And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy."
24,15,4,"And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for"
24,15,5,"For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask concerning thy welfare?"
24,15,6,"Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting."
24,15,7,"And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave"
24,15,8,"Their widows are multiplied to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused"
24,15,9,"She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath breathed her last; her sun is gone down while"
24,15,10,"Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on interest, nor have men lent to me on interest;"
24,15,11,"The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee"
24,15,12,"Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?"

24,15,15,"O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke."
24,15,16,"Thy words were found, and I ate them; and thy word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts."
24,15,17,"I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation."
24,15,18,"Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable,"
24,15,19,"Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou shalt return, then will I bring thee again,"
24,15,20,"And I will make thee to this people a fortified brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I"
24,15,21,"And I will deliver thee from the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee from the hand of the terrible."
24,16,1,"The word of the LORD came also to me, saying,"
24,16,2,"Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons nor daughters in this place."
24,16,3,"For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bore them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land;"
24,16,4,"They shall die by grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried;"
24,16,5,"For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the LORD,"
24,16,6,"Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall"
24,16,7,"Neither shall"
24,16,8,"Also, thou shalt not go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink."
24,16,9,"For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride."
24,16,10,"And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt show this people all these words, and they shall say to thee, Why hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what"
24,16,11,"Then shalt thou say to them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;"
24,16,12,"And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken to me:"
24,16,13,"Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not,"
24,16,14,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;"
24,16,15,"But, The LORD liveth, that brought the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands where he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers."
24,16,16,"Behold, I will send for many fishermen, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and afterwards will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks."
24,16,17,"For my eyes"
24,16,18,"And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled my inheritance with the dead bodies of their detestable and abominable things."
24,16,19,"O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come to thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and"

24,17,19,"Thus said the LORD to me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, by which the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;"
24,17,20,"And say to them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter by these gates:"

24,17,23,"But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction."
24,17,24,"And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken to me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work in it;"
24,17,25,"Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever."
24,17,26,"And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, to the house of the LORD."
24,17,27,"But if ye will not hearken to me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched."
24,18,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,"

24,18,3,"Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels."
24,18,4,"And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make"
24,18,5,"Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"

24,18,11,"Now therefore come, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a plot against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good."

24,19,4,"Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it to other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;"
24,19,5,"They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire"

24,34,21,"And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes I will give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which are gone up from you."
24,34,22,"Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant."
24,35,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,"
24,35,2,"Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink."
24,35,3,"Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;"
24,35,4,"And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, who"
24,35,5,"And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, Drink ye wine."
24,35,6,"But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine,"
24,35,7,"Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have"
24,35,8,"Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;"
24,35,9,"Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:"
24,35,10,"But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us."
24,35,11,"But it came to pass, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem."
24,35,12,"Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying,"
24,35,13,"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD."
24,35,14,"The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for to this day they drink none, but obey their father’s commandment: however I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not to me."
24,35,15,"I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending"
24,35,16,"Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened to me:"
24,35,17,"Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered."
24,35,18,"And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he hath commanded you:"
24,35,19,"Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before me for ever."
24,36,1,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,"
24,36,2,"Take thee a scroll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to thee, from the days of Josiah, even to this day."
24,36,3,"It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin."
24,36,4,"Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken to him, upon a scroll of a book."
24,36,5,"And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I"
24,36,6,"Therefore go thou, and read in the scroll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD’S house upon the day of fasting: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities."
24,36,7,"It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great"
24,36,8,"And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD’S house."
24,36,9,"And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month,"
24,36,10,"Then Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entrance of the new gate of the LORD’S house, in the ears of all the people."
24,36,11,"When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,"
24,36,12,"Then he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there,"
24,36,13,"Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people."
24,36,14,"Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in thy hand the scroll in which thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them."
24,36,15,"And they said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read"
24,36,16,"Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and another, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words."
24,36,17,"And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?"
24,36,18,"Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote"
24,36,19,"Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide thyself, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye are."
24,36,20,"And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king."
24,36,21,"So the king sent Jehudi to bring the scroll: and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king."
24,36,22,"Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and"
24,36,23,"And it came to pass,"
24,36,24,"Yet they were not afraid, nor tore their garments,"
24,36,25,"Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll: but he would not hear them."
24,36,26,"But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them."
24,36,27,"Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,"
24,36,28,"Take thee again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah hath burned."
24,36,29,"And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this scroll, saying, Why hast thou written in it, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from there man and beast?"
24,36,30,"Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost."
24,36,31,"And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not."
24,36,32,"Then Jeremiah took another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote in it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were besides added to them many like words."
24,37,1,"And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah."
24,37,2,"But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, hearkened to the words of the LORD, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah."
24,37,3,"And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the LORD our God for us."
24,37,4,"Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison."
24,37,5,"Then Pharaoh’s army had come from Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem."
24,37,6,"Then came the word of the LORD to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,"
24,37,7,"Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you to me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which hath come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land."
24,37,8,"And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire."
24,37,9,"Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart."
24,37,10,"For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained"
24,37,11,"And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,"
24,37,12,"Then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself from there in the midst of the people."
24,37,13,"And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard"
24,37,14,"Then said Jeremiah,"
24,37,15,"Therefore the princes were angry with Jeremiah, and beat him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison."
24,37,16,"When Jeremiah had entered into the dungeon, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;"
24,37,17,"Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there"
24,37,18,"Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, How have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?"
24,37,19,"Where"
24,37,20,"Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there."
24,37,21,"Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the baker’s street, until all the bread in the city should be consumed. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison."
24,38,1,"Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,"
24,38,2,"Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prize, and shall live."
24,38,3,"Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which shall take it."
24,38,4,"Therefore the princes said to the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the harm."
24,38,5,"Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he"
24,38,6,"Then they took Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that"
24,38,7,"Now when Ebedmelech the Cushite, one of the eunuchs who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;"
24,38,8,"Ebedmelech went out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying,"
24,38,9,"My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is certain to die from hunger in the place where he is: for"
24,38,10,"Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Cushite, saying, Take from here thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dieth."
24,38,11,"So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there old clothes and old rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah."
24,38,12,"And Ebedmelech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, Put now"
24,38,13,"So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison."
24,38,14,"Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entrance that"
24,38,15,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare"
24,38,16,"So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying,"
24,38,17,"Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house:"
24,38,18,"But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape from their hand."
24,38,19,"And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that have fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me."
24,38,20,"But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver"
24,38,21,"But if thou shalt refuse to go forth, this"
24,38,22,"And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house"
24,38,23,"So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire."
24,38,24,"Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die."
24,38,25,"But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come to thee, and say to thee, Declare to us now what thou hast said to the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said to thee:"
24,38,26,"Then thou shalt say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there."
24,38,27,"Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived."
24,38,28,"So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was"
24,39,1,"In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it."
24,39,2,""
24,39,3,"And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate,"
24,39,4,"And it came to pass, when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate between the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain."
24,39,5,"But the Chaldeans’ army pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him."
24,39,6,"Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah."
24,39,7,"Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon."
24,39,8,"And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem."
24,39,9,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained."
24,39,10,"But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time."
24,39,11,"Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,"
24,39,12,"Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do to him even as he shall say to thee."
24,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s princes;"
24,39,14,"Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people."
24,39,15,"Now the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,"
24,39,16,"Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Cushite, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be"
24,39,17,"But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou"
24,39,18,"For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prize to thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD."
24,40,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon."
24,40,2,"And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place."
24,40,3,"Now the LORD hath brought"
24,40,4,"And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which"
24,40,5,"Now while he had not yet gone back,"
24,40,6,"Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land."
24,40,7,"Now when all the captains of the forces who"
24,40,8,"Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men."
24,40,9,"And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you."
24,40,10,"As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, who will come to us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put"
24,40,11,"Likewise when all the Jews that"
24,40,12,"Even all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits in abundance."
24,40,13,"Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that"
24,40,14,"And said to him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not."
24,40,15,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know"
24,40,16,"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael."
24,41,1,"Now it came to pass in the seventh month,"
24,41,2,"Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land."
24,41,3,"Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him,"
24,41,4,"And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew"
24,41,5,"That there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria,"
24,41,6,"And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam."
24,41,7,"And it was"
24,41,8,"But ten men were found among them that said to Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he left them alone, and slew them not among their brethren."
24,41,9,"Now the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah,"
24,41,10,"Then Ishmael carried away captive all the remnant of the people that"
24,41,11,"But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that"
24,41,12,"Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that"
24,41,13,"Now it came to pass,"
24,41,14,"So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah."
24,41,15,"But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites."
24,41,16,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that"
24,41,17,"And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,"
24,41,18,"Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land."
24,42,1,"Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near,"
24,42,2,"And said to Jeremiah the prophet, We beseech thee, let our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us to the LORD thy God,"
24,42,3,"That the LORD thy God may show us the way in which we may walk, and the thing that we may do."
24,42,4,"Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard"
24,42,5,"Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us."
24,42,6,"Whether"
24,42,7,"And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah."
24,42,8,"Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who"
24,42,9,"And said to them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;"
24,42,10,"If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull"
24,42,11,"Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I"
24,42,12,"And I will show mercies to you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land."
24,42,13,"But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,"
24,42,14,"Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor hunger for bread; and there will we dwell:"
24,42,15,"And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;"
24,42,16,"Then it shall come to pass,"
24,42,17,"So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them."
24,42,18,"For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As my anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an horror, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more."
24,42,19,"The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day."
24,42,20,"For ye were hypocrites in your hearts, when ye sent me to the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us to the LORD our God; and according to all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare to us, and we will do"
24,42,21,"And"
24,42,22,"Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place where ye desire to go"
24,43,1,"And it came to pass,"
24,43,2,"Then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying to Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:"
24,43,3,"But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon."
24,43,4,"So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah."
24,43,5,"But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that had returned from all nations, where they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;"
24,43,6,""

26,1,24,"And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings."
26,1,25,"And there was a voice from the firmament that"
26,1,26,"And above the firmament that"
26,1,27,"And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire around within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness on all sides."
26,1,28,"As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so"
26,2,1,"And he said to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee."
26,2,2,"And the spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spoke to me."
26,2,3,"And he said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me,"
26,2,4,"For"
26,2,5,"And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they"
26,2,6,"And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns"
26,2,7,"And thou shalt speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they"
26,2,8,"But thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee."
26,2,9,"And when I looked, behold, an hand"
26,2,10,"And he spread it before me; and it"
26,3,1,"Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat what thou findest; eat this scroll, and go speak to the house of Israel."
26,3,2,"So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that scroll."
26,3,3,"And he said to me, Son of man, cause thy stomach to eat, and fill thy body with this scroll that I give thee. Then did I eat"
26,3,4,"And he said to me, Son of man, depart, go to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them."
26,3,5,"For thou"
26,3,6,"Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened to thee."
26,3,7,"But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee; for they will not hearken to me: for all the house of Israel"
26,3,8,"Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads."
26,3,9,"As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they"
26,3,10,"Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears."
26,3,11,"And depart, go to them of the captivity, to the children of thy people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear."
26,3,12,"Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing,"
26,3,13,""
26,3,14,"So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me."
26,3,15,"Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there overwhelmed among them seven days."
26,3,16,"And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
26,3,17,"Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me."
26,3,18,"When I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked"
26,3,19,"Yet if thou shalt warn the wicked, and he will not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul."
26,3,20,"Again, When a righteous"
26,3,21,"Nevertheless if thou shalt warn the righteous"
26,3,22,"And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee."
26,3,23,"Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face."
26,3,24,"Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut thyself within thy house."
26,3,25,"But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put cords upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:"
26,3,26,"And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they"
26,3,27,"But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they"
26,4,1,"Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it the city,"
26,4,2,"And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mound against it; set the camp also against it, and set"
26,4,3,"Moreover take thou to thee an iron pan, and set it"
26,4,4,"Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it:"
26,4,5,"For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel."
26,4,6,"And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year."
26,4,7,"Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thy arm"
26,4,8,"And, behold, I will lay cords upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege."
26,4,9,"Take thou also to thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread of them,"
26,4,10,"And thy food which thou shalt eat"
26,4,11,"Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink."
26,4,12,"And thou shalt eat it"
26,4,13,"And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them."
26,4,14,"Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither hath abominable flesh come into my mouth."
26,4,15,"Then he said to me, Lo, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread with them."
26,4,16,"Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and in horror:"
26,4,17,"That they may lack bread and water, and be appalled one with another, and pine away for their iniquity."
26,5,1,"And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber’s razor, and cause"
26,5,2,"Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part,"
26,5,3,"Thou shalt also take of them a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts."
26,5,4,"Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; from which a fire shall come forth into all the house of Israel."
26,5,5,"Thus saith the Lord GOD; This"
26,5,6,"And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that"
26,5,7,"Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that"
26,5,8,"Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I,"
26,5,9,"And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and the like of which I will not do any more, because of all thy abominations."
26,5,10,"Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds."
26,5,11,"Therefore,"
26,5,12,"A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword around thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them."
26,5,13,"Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken"
26,5,14,"Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that"
26,5,15,"So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an horror to the nations that"
26,5,16,"When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for"
26,5,17,"So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken"
26,6,1,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
26,6,2,"Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,"
26,6,3,"And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I,"
26,6,4,"And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain"
26,6,5,"And I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones about your altars."
26,6,6,"In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished."
26,6,7,"And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I"
26,6,8,"Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have"
26,6,9,"And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations where they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their adulterous heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the harlot with their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations."
26,6,10,"And they shall know that I"
26,6,11,"Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence."
26,6,12,"He that is far off shall die by the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them."
26,6,13,"Then shall ye know that I"
26,6,14,"So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I"
26,7,1,"Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
26,7,2,"Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD to the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land."
26,7,3,"Now"
26,7,4,"And my eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I"
26,7,5,"Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come."
26,7,6,"An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come."
26,7,7,"The morning is come upon thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble"
26,7,8,"Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish my anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thy abominations."
26,7,9,"And my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thy abominations"
26,7,10,"Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded."
26,7,11,"Violence hath risen into a rod of wickedness: none of them"
26,7,12,"The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath"
26,7,13,"For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision"
26,7,14,"They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath"
26,7,15,"The sword"
26,7,16,"But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity."
26,7,17,"All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak"
26,7,18,"They shall also gird"
26,7,19,"They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their stomachs: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity."
26,7,20,"As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations"
26,7,21,"And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it."
26,7,22,"My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret"
26,7,23,"Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence."
26,7,24,"Therefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled."
26,7,25,"Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and"
26,7,26,"Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders."
26,7,27,"The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do to them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I"
26,8,1,"And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth"
26,8,2,"Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber."
26,8,3,"And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where"
26,8,4,"And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel"
26,8,5,"Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up thy eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entrance."
26,8,6,"He said furthermore to me, Son of man, seest thou what they do?"
26,8,7,"And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall."
26,8,8,"Then said he to me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had dug in the wall, behold a door."
26,8,9,"And he said to me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here."
26,8,10,"So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed around upon the wall."
26,8,11,"And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up."
26,8,12,"Then said he to me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth."
26,8,13,"He said also to me, Turn thee yet again,"
26,8,14,"Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD’S house which"
26,8,15,"Then said he to me, Hast thou seen"
26,8,16,"And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD’S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar,"
26,8,17,"Then he said to me, Hast thou seen"
26,8,18,"Therefore will I also deal in fury: my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice,"
26,9,1,"He cried also in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man"
26,9,2,"And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them"
26,9,3,"And the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, on which he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, who"
26,9,4,"And the LORD said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that are done in the midst of it."
26,9,5,"And to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:"
26,9,6,"Slay utterly old"
26,9,7,"And he said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city."
26,9,8,"And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy the whole remnant of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?"
26,9,9,"Then said he to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah"
26,9,10,"And as for me also, my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity,"
26,9,11,"And, behold, the man clothed with linen, who"
26,10,1,"Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne."
26,10,2,"And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels,"
26,10,3,"Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court."
26,10,4,"Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub,"
26,10,5,"And the sound of the cherubim’s wings was heard"
26,10,6,"And it came to pass,"
26,10,7,"And"
26,10,8,"And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man’s hand under their wings."
26,10,9,"And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels"
26,10,10,"And"
26,10,11,"When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went."
26,10,12,"And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels,"
26,10,13,"As for the wheels, it was cried to them in my hearing, O wheel."
26,10,14,"And every one had four faces: the first face"
26,10,15,"And the cherubim were lifted up. This"
26,10,16,"And when the cherubim went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them."
26,10,17,"When they stood,"
26,10,18,"Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim."
26,10,19,"And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also"
26,10,20,"This"
26,10,21,"Every one had four faces each, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man"
26,10,22,"And the likeness of their faces"
26,11,1,"Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of the LORD’S house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people."
26,11,2,"Then said he to me, Son of man, these"
26,11,3,"Who say,"
26,11,4,"Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man."
26,11,5,"And the spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said to me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind,"
26,11,6,"Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled its streets with the slain."
26,11,7,"Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they"
26,11,8,"Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD."
26,11,9,"And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you."
26,11,10,"Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I"
26,11,11,"This"
26,11,12,"And ye shall know that I"
26,11,13,"And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?"
26,11,14,"Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
26,11,15,"Son of man, thy brethren,"
26,11,16,"Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come."
26,11,17,"Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel."
26,11,18,"And they shall come there, and they shall take away from there all its detestable things and all its abominations."
26,11,19,"And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:"
26,11,20,"That they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God."
26,11,21,"But"
26,11,22,"Then the cherubim raised their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel"
26,11,23,"And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which"
26,11,24,"Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me."
26,11,25,"Then I spoke to them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shown me."
26,12,1,"The word of the LORD also came to me, saying,"
26,12,2,"Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they"
26,12,3,"Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee"
26,12,4,"Then shalt thou bring forth thy baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for captivity: and thou shalt go forth at evening in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity."
26,12,5,"Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry"
26,12,6,"In their sight shalt thou bear"
26,12,7,"And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my baggage by day, as baggage for captivity, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand; I brought"
26,12,8,"And in the morning came the word of the LORD to me, saying,"
26,12,9,"Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to thee, What doest thou?"
26,12,10,"Say thou to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden"
26,12,11,"Say, I"
26,12,12,"And the prince that"
26,12,13,"My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon"
26,12,14,"And I will scatter toward every wind all that"
26,12,15,"And they shall know that I"
26,12,16,"But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen where they come; and they shall know that I"
26,12,17,"Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
26,12,18,"Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and anxious care;"
26,12,19,"And say to the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem,"
26,12,20,"And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I"
26,12,21,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
26,12,22,"Son of man, what"
26,12,23,"Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say to them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision."
26,12,24,"For there shall no more be any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel."
26,12,25,"For I"
26,12,26,"Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
26,12,27,"Son of man, behold,"
26,12,28,"Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be further deferred, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD."
26,13,1,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
26,13,2,"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou to them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;"
26,13,3,"Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!"

26,28,17,"Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee."
26,28,18,"Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thy iniquities, by the iniquity of thy merchandise; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee."

26,30,8,"And they shall know that I"
26,30,9,"In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Cushites afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh."
26,30,10,"Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon."
26,30,11,"He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain."

26,31,4,"The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running around his plants, and sent out her little rivers to all the trees of the field."
26,31,5,"Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth."
26,31,6,"All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations."
26,31,7,"Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters."
26,31,8,"The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; not any tree in the garden of God was like him in his beauty."

26,31,12,"And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth have gone down from his shadow, and have left him."
26,31,13,"Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:"
26,31,14,"To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered to death, to the lower parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit."
26,31,15,"Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained its floods, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him."
26,31,16,"I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the lower parts of the earth."

26,33,5,"He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul."
26,33,6,"But if the watchman will see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword will come, and take"

26,36,30,"And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen."
26,36,31,"Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that"
26,36,32,"Not for your sakes do I"
26,36,33,"Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause"
26,36,34,"And the desolate land shall be tilled, though it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by."
26,36,35,"And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities"
26,36,36,"Then the heathen that are left around you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined"
26,36,37,"Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet"
26,36,38,"As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I"
26,37,1,"The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which"
26,37,2,"And caused me to pass by them on every side: and, behold,"
26,37,3,"And he said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest."
26,37,4,"Again he said to me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say to them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD."
26,37,5,"Thus saith the Lord GOD to these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:"
26,37,6,"And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I"
26,37,7,"So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone."
26,37,8,"And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but"
26,37,9,"Then said he to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live."
26,37,10,"So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army."
26,37,11,"Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off on our part."
26,37,12,"Therefore prophesy and say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel."
26,37,13,"And ye shall know that I"
26,37,14,"And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken"
26,37,15,"The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,"
26,37,16,"Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and"
26,37,17,"And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thy hand."
26,37,18,"And when the children of thy people shall speak to thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou"
26,37,19,"Say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which"
26,37,20,"And the sticks on which thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes."
26,37,21,"And say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, where they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:"
26,37,22,"And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:"
26,37,23,"Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God."
26,37,24,"And David my servant"
26,37,25,"And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell in it,"
26,37,26,"Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore."
26,37,27,"My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
26,37,28,"And the heathen shall know that I the LORD sanctifieth Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore."
26,38,1,"And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
26,38,2,"Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,"
26,38,3,"And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I"
26,38,4,"And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thy army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts"
26,38,5,"Persia, Cush, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet:"
26,38,6,"Gomer, and all his troops; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his troops:"
26,38,7,"Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled to thee, and be thou a guard to them."
26,38,8,"After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land"
26,38,9,"Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy troops, and many people with thee."
26,38,10,"Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass,"
26,38,11,"And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,"
26,38,12,"To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thy hand upon the desolate places"
26,38,13,"Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all its young lions, shall say to thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?"
26,38,14,"Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know"
26,38,15,"And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army:"
26,38,16,"And thou shalt come against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes."
26,38,17,"Thus saith the Lord GOD;"
26,38,18,"And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD,"
26,38,19,"For in my jealousy"
26,38,20,"So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that"
26,38,21,"And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man’s sword shall be against his brother."
26,38,22,"And I will enter into judgment against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his troops, and upon the many people that"
26,38,23,"Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I"
26,39,1,"Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I"
26,39,2,"And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:"
26,39,3,"And I will strike thy bow out of thy left hand, and I will cause thy arrows to fall from thy right hand."
26,39,4,"Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy troops, and the people that"
26,39,5,"Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken"
26,39,6,"And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell securely in the isles: and they shall know that I"
26,39,7,"So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not"
26,39,8,"Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this"
26,39,9,"And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the javelins, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:"
26,39,10,"So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down"
26,39,11,"And it shall come to pass in that day,"
26,39,12,"And seven months shall the house of Israel be in burying them, that they may cleanse the land."
26,39,13,"Yea, all the people of the land shall bury"
26,39,14,"And they shall set apart men for"
26,39,15,"And"
26,39,16,"And also the name of the city"
26,39,17,"And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak to every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you,"
26,39,18,"Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan."
26,39,19,"And ye shall eat fat till ye are full, and drink blood till ye are drunk, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you."
26,39,20,"Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD."
26,39,21,"And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them."
26,39,22,"So the house of Israel shall know that I"
26,39,23,"And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore I hid my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so they all fell by the sword."
26,39,24,"According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done to them, and hidden my face from them."
26,39,25,"Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;"
26,39,26,"After they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made"
26,39,27,"When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of the lands of their enemies, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;"
26,39,28,"Then shall they know that I"
26,39,29,"Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD."
26,40,1,"In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth"
26,40,2,"In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which"
26,40,3,"And he brought me there, and, behold,"
26,40,4,"And the man said to me, Son of man, behold with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for to the intent that I might show"
26,40,5,"And behold a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits"
26,40,6,"Then he came to the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate,"
26,40,7,"And"
26,40,8,"He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed."
26,40,9,"Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate"
26,40,10,"And the little chambers of the gate eastward"
26,40,11,"And he measured the breadth of the entrance of the gate, ten cubits;"
26,40,12,"The space also before the little chambers"
26,40,13,"He measured then the gate from the roof of"
26,40,14,"He made also posts of sixty cubits, even to the post of the court around to the gate."
26,40,15,"And from the face of the gate of the entrance to the face of the porch of the inner gate"
26,40,16,"And"
26,40,17,"Then he brought me into the outer court, and, lo,"
26,40,18,"And the pavement by the side of the gates"
26,40,19,"Then he measured the breadth from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court on the other side, an hundred cubits eastward and northward."
26,40,20,"And the gate of the outer court that looked toward the north, he measured its length, and its breadth."
26,40,21,"And its little chambers"
26,40,22,"And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees,"
26,40,23,"And the gate of the inner court"
26,40,24,"After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured its posts and its arches according to these measures."
26,40,25,"And"
26,40,26,"And"
26,40,27,"And"
26,40,28,"And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;"
26,40,29,"And its little chambers, and its posts, and its arches, according to these measures: and"
26,40,30,"And the arches all around"
26,40,31,"And its arches"
26,40,32,"And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures."
26,40,33,"And its little chambers, and its posts, and its arches,"
26,40,34,"And its arches"
26,40,35,"And he brought me to the north gate, and measured"
26,40,36,"Its little chambers, its posts, and its arches, and the windows all around: the length"
26,40,37,"And its posts"
26,40,38,"And the chambers and its entrances"
26,40,39,"And in the porch of the gate"
26,40,40,"And on the outside, as one goeth up to the entrance of the north gate,"
26,40,41,"Four tables"
26,40,42,"And the four tables"
26,40,43,"And within"
26,40,44,"And outside the inner gate"
26,40,45,"And he said to me, This chamber, whose prospect"
26,40,46,"And the chamber whose prospect"
26,40,47,"So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar"
26,40,48,"And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured"
26,40,49,"The length of the porch"
26,41,1,"Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side,"
26,41,2,"And the breadth of the door"
26,41,3,"Then he went inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits."
26,41,4,"So he measured the length of it, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said to me, This"
26,41,5,"Afterward he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of"
26,41,6,"And the side chambers"
26,41,7,"And"
26,41,8,"I saw also the height of the house all around: the foundations of the side chambers"
26,41,9,"The thickness of the wall, which"
26,41,10,"And between the chambers"
26,41,11,"And the doors of the side chambers"
26,41,12,"Now the building that"
26,41,13,"So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, an hundred cubits long;"
26,41,14,"Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits."
26,41,15,"And he measured the length of the building in front of the separate place which"
26,41,16,"The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries on every side on their three stories, opposite the door, panelled with wood all around, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows"
26,41,17,"To that above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall all around within and without, by measure."
26,41,18,"And"
26,41,19,"So that the face of a man"
26,41,20,"From the ground to above the door"
26,41,21,"The posts of the temple"
26,41,22,"The altar of wood"
26,41,23,"And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors."
26,41,24,"And the doors had two leaves each, two turning leaves; two"
26,41,25,"And"
26,41,26,"And"
26,42,1,"Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that"
26,42,2,"Before the length of an hundred cubits"
26,42,3,"Opposite the twenty"
26,42,4,"And before the chambers"
26,42,5,"Now the upper chambers"
26,42,6,"For they"
26,42,7,"And the wall that"
26,42,8,"For the length of the chambers that"
26,42,9,"And from under these chambers"
26,42,10,"The chambers"
26,42,11,"And the way before them"
26,42,12,"And according to the doors of the chambers that"
26,42,13,"Then said he to me, The north chambers"
26,42,14,"When the priests enter in it, then shall they not go out of the holy"
26,42,15,"Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect"
26,42,16,"He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed on every side."
26,42,17,"He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed on every side."
26,42,18,"He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed."
26,42,19,"He turned about to the west side,"
26,42,20,"He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall all around, five hundred"
26,43,1,"Afterward he brought me to the gate,"
26,43,2,"And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice"
26,43,3,"And"
26,43,4,"And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect"
26,43,5,"So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house."
26,43,6,"And I heard"
26,43,7,"And he said to me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile,"
26,43,8,"In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: therefore I have consumed them in my anger."
26,43,9,"Now let them put away their harlotry, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever."
26,43,10,"Thou son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern."
26,43,11,"And if they will be ashamed of all that they have done, show them the form of the house, and the fashion of it, and its exits, and its entrances, and all its forms, and all its ordinances, and all its forms, and all its laws: and write"
26,43,12,"This"
26,43,13,"And these"
26,43,14,"And from the bottom"
26,43,15,"So the altar"
26,43,16,"And the altar"
26,43,17,"And the ledge"
26,43,18,"And he said to me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These"
26,43,19,"And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who approach to me, to minister to me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bull for a sin offering."
26,43,20,"And thou shalt take of his blood, and put"
26,43,21,"Thou shalt take the bull also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, outside of the sanctuary."
26,43,22,"And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed"
26,43,23,"When thou hast finished cleansing"
26,43,24,"And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them"
26,43,25,"Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat"
26,43,26,"Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves."
26,43,27,"And when these days are fulfilled, it shall be,"
26,44,1,"Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outer sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it"
26,44,2,"Then said the LORD to me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut."
26,44,3,""
26,44,4,"Then he brought me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face."
26,44,5,"And the LORD said to me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears all that I say to thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every exit from the sanctuary."
26,44,6,"And thou shalt say to the rebellious,"
26,44,7,"In that ye have brought"
26,44,8,"And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves."
26,44,9,"Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that"
26,44,10,"And the Levites that have gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity."
26,44,11,"Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary,"
26,44,12,"Because they ministered to them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity."
26,44,13,"And they shall not come near to me, to do the office of a priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy"
26,44,14,"But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all its service, and for all that shall be done in it."
26,44,15,"But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me, and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD:"
26,44,16,"They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge."
26,44,17,"And it shall come to pass,"
26,44,18,"They shall have linen headdresses upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird"
26,44,19,"And when they go forth into the outer court,"
26,44,20,"Neither shall they shave their heads, nor allow their locks to grow long; they shall only cut"
26,44,21,"Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court."
26,44,22,"Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before."
26,44,23,"And they shall teach my people"
26,44,24,"And in controversy they shall stand in judgment;"
26,44,25,"And they shall come near no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves."
26,44,26,"And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon to him seven days."
26,44,27,"And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, to the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord GOD."
26,44,28,"And it shall be to them for an inheritance: I"
26,44,29,"They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs."
26,44,30,"And the first of all the firstfruits of all"
26,44,31,"The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether of fowl or beast."
26,45,1,"Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation to the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length"
26,45,2,"Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred"
26,45,3,"And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary"
26,45,4,"The holy"
26,45,5,"And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers."

26,46,10,"And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth."
26,46,11,"And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bull, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah."

27,1,5,"And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s food, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end of which they might stand before the king."
27,1,6,"Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:"

27,1,10,"And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the children who"

27,1,13,"Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s food: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants."
27,1,14,"So he consented to them in this matter, and tried them ten days."
27,1,15,"And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children who ate the portion of the king’s food."
27,1,16,"Thus Melzar took away the portion of their food, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them vegetables."
27,1,17,"As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams."
27,1,18,"Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar."
27,1,19,"And the king talked with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore they stood before the king."
27,1,20,"And in all matters of wisdom"

27,2,1,"And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, by which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him."
27,2,2,"Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to show the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king."
27,2,3,"And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream."
27,2,4,"Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Syrian, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation."
27,2,5,"The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known to me the dream, with the interpretation of it, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a refuse heap."
27,2,6,"But if ye shall show the dream, and the interpretation of it, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore show me the dream, and the interpretation of it."
27,2,7,"They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it."
27,2,8,"The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me."
27,2,9,"But if ye will not make known to me the dream,"

27,2,18,"That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise"
27,2,19,"Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven."
27,2,20,"Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:"
27,2,21,"And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:"
27,2,22,"He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what"
27,2,23,"I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known to me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast"
27,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise"

27,2,26,"The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name"
27,2,27,"Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded the wise"
27,2,28,"But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;"
27,2,29,"As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came"
27,2,30,"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for"
27,2,31,"Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness"
27,2,32,"The head of this image"

27,2,34,"Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet"
27,2,35,"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."
27,2,36,"This"
27,2,37,"Thou, O king,"
27,2,38,"And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou"
27,2,39,"And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth."
27,2,40,"And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all"
27,2,41,"And though thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with the miry clay."
27,2,42,"And"
27,2,43,"And though thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not join one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay."
27,2,44,"And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people,"
27,2,45,"Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass after this: and the dream"
27,2,46,"Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours to him."
27,2,47,"The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth"
27,2,48,"Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise"
27,2,49,"Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel"
27,3,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height"
27,3,2,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up."
27,3,3,"Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up."

27,3,8,"Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews."
27,3,9,"They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever."
27,3,10,"Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image:"
27,3,11,"And whoever falleth not down and worshippeth,"
27,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."
27,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in"
27,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them,"
27,3,15,"Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made;"

27,3,19,"Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego:"
27,3,20,"And he commanded the most mighty men that"

27,3,23,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
27,3,24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste,"
27,3,25,"He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God."
27,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace,"
27,3,27,"And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor had the smell of fire passed upon them."

27,4,34,"And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion"
27,4,35,"And all the inhabitants of the earth"
27,4,36,"At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honour and brightness returned to me; and my counsellors and my lords sought to me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me."
27,4,37,"Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works"
27,5,1,"Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand."
27,5,2,"Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which"
27,5,3,"Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which"
27,5,4,"They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone."
27,5,5,"In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote opposite the lampstand upon the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote."
27,5,6,"Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another."
27,5,7,"The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers."
27,5,8,"Then came in all the king’s wise"
27,5,9,"Then was the king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were confused."
27,5,10,""
27,5,11,"There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom"
27,5,12,"Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, the interpreting of dreams, and declaring of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation."
27,5,13,"Then was Daniel brought in before the king."
27,5,14,"I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods"
27,5,15,"And now the wise"
27,5,16,"And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation of it, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and"
27,5,17,"Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation."
27,5,18,"O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:"
27,5,19,"And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down."
27,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:"
27,5,21,"And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling"
27,5,22,"And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this;"
27,5,23,"But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath"
27,5,24,"Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written."
27,5,25,"And this"
27,5,26,"This"
27,5,27,"TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting."
27,5,28,"PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians."
27,5,29,"Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and"
27,5,30,"In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain."
27,5,31,"And Darius the Median took the kingdom,"
27,6,1,"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, who should be over the whole kingdom;"
27,6,2,"And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel"
27,6,3,"Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit"
27,6,4,"Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he"
27,6,5,"Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find"
27,6,6,"Then these presidents and princes assembled to the king, and said thus to him, King Darius, live for ever."
27,6,7,"All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions."
27,6,8,"Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not."
27,6,9,"Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree."
27,6,10,"Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did before."
27,6,11,"Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God."
27,6,12,"Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask"
27,6,13,"Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, who"
27,6,14,"Then the king, when he heard"
27,6,15,"Then these men assembled to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians"
27,6,16,"Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast"
27,6,17,"And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel."
27,6,18,"Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him."
27,6,19,"Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions."
27,6,20,"And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel:"
27,6,21,"Then said Daniel to the king, O king, live for ever."
27,6,22,"My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt."
27,6,23,"Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel out of the den. So Daniel was taken out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God."
27,6,24,"And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast"
27,6,25,"Then king Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you."
27,6,26,"I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he"
27,6,27,"He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions."
27,6,28,"So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian."
27,7,1,"In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream,"
27,7,2,"Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven strove upon the great sea."
27,7,3,"And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another."
27,7,4,"The first"
27,7,5,"And behold another beast, a second, like a bear, and it raised itself on one side, and"
27,7,6,"After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it."
27,7,7,"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the remainder with its feet: and it"
27,7,8,"I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn"
27,7,9,"I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment"
27,7,10,"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened."
27,7,11,"I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke: I beheld"
27,7,12,"As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time."
27,7,13,"I saw in the night visions, and, behold,"
27,7,14,"And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion"
27,7,15,"I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of"
27,7,16,"I came near to one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things."
27,7,17,"These great beasts, which are four,"
27,7,18,"But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever."
27,7,19,"Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth"
27,7,20,"And of the ten horns that"
27,7,21,"I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;"
27,7,22,"Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom."
27,7,23,"Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be different from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces."
27,7,24,"And the ten horns out of this kingdom"
27,7,25,"And he shall speak"
27,7,26,"But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy"
27,7,27,"And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom"
27,7,28,"Here"
27,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me,"
27,8,2,"And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I"
27,8,3,"Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had"
27,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither"
27,8,5,"And as I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat"
27,8,6,"And he came to the ram that had"
27,8,7,"And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand."
27,8,8,"Therefore the male goat became very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and in its stead came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven."
27,8,9,"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant"
27,8,10,"And it grew great,"
27,8,11,"Yea, he magnified"
27,8,12,"And an host was given"
27,8,13,"Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain"
27,8,14,"And he said to me, Until two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."
27,8,15,"And it came to pass, when I,"
27,8,16,"And I heard a man’s voice between"
27,8,17,"So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end"
27,8,18,"Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright."
27,8,19,"And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end"
27,8,20,"The ram which thou sawest having"
27,8,21,"And the rough goat"
27,8,22,"Now that being broken, though four stood up in its place, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power."
27,8,23,"And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up."
27,8,24,"And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and continue, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people."
27,8,25,"And through his policy also he shall cause deceit to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify"
27,8,26,"And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told"
27,8,27,"And I Daniel fainted, and was sick"
27,9,1,"In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;"
27,9,2,"In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, concerning which the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem."
27,9,3,"And I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:"
27,9,4,"And I prayed to the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;"
27,9,5,"We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:"
27,9,6,"Neither have we hearkened to thy servants the prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land."
27,9,7,"O Lord, righteousness"
27,9,8,"O Lord, to us"
27,9,9,"To the Lord our God"
27,9,10,"Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets."
27,9,11,"And all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that"
27,9,12,"And he hath confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven it hath not been done as it hath been done upon Jerusalem."
27,9,13,"As"
27,9,14,"Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God"
27,9,15,"And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast made thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly."
27,9,16,"O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thy anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people"
27,9,17,"Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake."
27,9,18,"O my God, incline thy ear, and hear; open thy eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies."
27,9,19,"O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thy own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name."
27,9,20,"And while I"
27,9,21,"Yea, while I"
27,9,22,"And he informed"
27,9,23,"At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to show"
27,9,24,"Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy."
27,9,25,"Know therefore and understand,"
27,9,26,"And after sixty and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and its end"
27,9,27,"And he shall confirm the covenant with many"
27,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing"
27,10,2,"In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks."
27,10,3,"I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled."
27,10,4,"And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which"
27,10,5,"Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins"
27,10,6,"His body also"
27,10,7,"And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves."
27,10,8,"Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength."
27,10,9,"Yet I heard the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then I was in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground."
27,10,10,"And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and"
27,10,11,"And he said to me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to thee, and stand upright: for to thee I am now sent. And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling."
27,10,12,"Then said he to me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words."
27,10,13,"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia."
27,10,14,"Now I have come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision"
27,10,15,"And when he had spoken such words to me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb."
27,10,16,"And, behold,"
27,10,17,"For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me."
27,10,18,"Then there came again and touched me"
27,10,19,"And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace"
27,10,20,"Then said he, Knowest thou for what cause I come to thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come."
27,10,21,"But I will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and"
27,11,1,"Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede,"
27,11,2,"And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than"
27,11,3,"And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will."
27,11,4,"And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those."
27,11,5,"And the king of the south shall be strong, and"
27,11,6,"And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in"
27,11,7,"But out of a branch of her roots shall"
27,11,8,"And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes,"
27,11,9,"So the king of the south shall come into"
27,11,10,"But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and"
27,11,11,"And the king of the south shall be moved with anger, and shall come forth and fight with him,"
27,11,12,""
27,11,13,"For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches."
27,11,14,"And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall."
27,11,15,"So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a bank, and take the most fortified cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither"
27,11,16,"But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed."
27,11,17,"He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand"
27,11,18,"After this shall he turn his face to the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause"
27,11,19,"Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found."
27,11,20,"Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes"
27,11,21,"And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries."
27,11,22,"And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflowed from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant."
27,11,23,"And after the league"
27,11,24,"He shall enter peaceably even upon the best places of the province; and he shall do"
27,11,25,"And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall plot against him."
27,11,26,"Yea, they that feed of the portion of his food shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain."
27,11,27,"And both these kings’ hearts"
27,11,28,"Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart"
27,11,29,"At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter."
27,11,30,"For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant."
27,11,31,"And forces shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily"
27,11,32,"And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that know their God shall be strong, and do"
27,11,33,"And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil,"
27,11,34,"Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help: but many shall join with them with flatteries."
27,11,35,"And"
27,11,36,"And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that which is determined shall be done."
27,11,37,"Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all."
27,11,38,"But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things."
27,11,39,"Thus shall he do in the strongest fortresses with a foreign god, whom he shall acknowledge"
27,11,40,"And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass through."
27,11,41,"He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many"
27,11,42,"He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape."
27,11,43,"But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Cushites"
27,11,44,"But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to sweep away many."
27,11,45,"And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him."
27,12,1,"And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation"
27,12,2,"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame"
27,12,3,"And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever."
27,12,4,"But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book,"
27,12,5,"Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood two others, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river."
27,12,6,"And"
27,12,7,"And I heard the man clothed in linen, who"

38,14,2,"For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city."
38,14,3,"Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle."
38,14,4,"And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which"
38,14,5,"And ye shall flee"
38,14,6,"And it shall come to pass in that day,"
38,14,7,"But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass,"
38,14,8,"And it shall be in that day,"
38,14,9,"And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one."
38,14,10,"All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin’s gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and"
38,14,11,"And"
38,14,12,"And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth."
38,14,13,"And it shall come to pass in that day,"
38,14,14,"And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen on every side shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance."
38,14,15,"And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the donkey, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague."
38,14,16,"And it shall come to pass,"
38,14,17,"And it shall be,"
38,14,18,"And if the family of Egypt shall not go up, and shall not come, that"
38,14,19,"This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles."
38,14,20,"In that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS TO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD’S house shall be like the bowls before the altar."
38,14,21,"Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness to the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and boil in them: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts."
39,1,1,"The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi."
39,1,2,"I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, How hast thou loved us?"
39,1,3,"And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness."
39,1,4,"Though Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever."
39,1,5,"And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel."
39,1,6,"A son honoureth"
39,1,7,"Ye offer polluted bread upon my altar; and ye say, How have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD"
39,1,8,"And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice,"
39,1,9,"And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious to us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your person? saith the LORD of hosts."
39,1,10,"Who"
39,1,11,"For from the rising of the sun even to the setting of the same my name"
39,1,12,"But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD"
39,1,13,"Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness"
39,1,14,"But cursed"
39,2,1,"And now, O ye priests, this commandment"
39,2,2,"If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay"
39,2,3,"Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces,"
39,2,4,"And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts."
39,2,5,"My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him"
39,2,6,"The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and turned many away from iniquity."
39,2,7,"For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he"
39,2,8,"But ye have departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts."
39,2,9,"Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law."
39,2,10,"Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?"
39,2,11,"Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD whom he loved, and hath married the daughter of a foreign god."
39,2,12,"The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering to the LORD of hosts."
39,2,13,"And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth"
39,2,14,"Yet ye say, Why? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet"
39,2,15,"And did he not make one? Yet had he the remnant of the spirit. And why one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth."
39,2,16,"For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for"
39,2,17,"Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, How have we wearied"
39,3,1,"Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts."
39,3,2,"But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he"
39,3,3,"And he shall sit"
39,3,4,"Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years."
39,3,5,"And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in"
39,3,6,"For I"
39,3,7,"Even from the days of your fathers ye have gone away from my ordinances, and have not kept"
39,3,8,"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, How have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings."
39,3,9,"Ye"
39,3,10,"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house, and test me now in this, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open for you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that"
39,3,11,"And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts."
39,3,12,"And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts."
39,3,13,"Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken"
39,3,14,"Ye have said, It"
39,3,15,"And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; even"
39,3,16,"Then they that feared the LORD spoke often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard"
39,3,17,"And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him."
39,3,18,"Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not."
39,4,1,"For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch."
39,4,2,"But to you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall."
39,4,3,"And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do"
39,4,4,"Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel,"
39,4,5,"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD:"
39,4,6,"And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse."

40,1,2,"Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;"
40,1,3,"And Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar; and Pharez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram;"
40,1,4,"And Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon;"

40,1,16,"And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."
40,1,17,"So all the generations from Abraham to David"
40,1,18,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this manner: When his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child by the Holy Spirit."
40,1,19,"Then Joseph her husband, being a just"
40,1,20,"But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit."
40,1,21,"And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins."
40,1,22,"Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying,"
40,1,23,"Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us."
40,1,24,"Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took to him his wife:"
40,1,25,"And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS."
40,2,1,"Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,"
40,2,2,"Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him."
40,2,3,"When Herod the king had heard"
40,2,4,"And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he enquired of them where the Christ should be born."
40,2,5,"And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,"
40,2,6,"And thou Bethlehem,"
40,2,7,"Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared."
40,2,8,"And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found"
40,2,9,"When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was."
40,2,10,"When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy."
40,2,11,"And when they had come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh."
40,2,12,"And being warned by God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way."
40,2,13,"And when they had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
40,2,14,"When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:"
40,2,15,"And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son."
40,2,16,"Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceeding angry, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all its surrounding lands, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men."
40,2,17,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,"
40,2,18,"In Ramah was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping"
40,2,19,"But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,"
40,2,20,"Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead who sought the young child’s life."
40,2,21,"And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel."
40,2,22,"But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there: however, being warned by God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:"
40,2,23,"And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene."
40,3,1,"In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,"
40,3,2,"And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
40,3,3,"For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
40,3,4,"And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leather belt about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey."
40,3,5,"Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region about Jordan,"
40,3,6,"And were baptized by him in Jordan, confessing their sins."
40,3,7,"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
40,3,8,"Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance:"
40,3,9,"And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for"
40,3,10,"And now also the axe is laid to the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
40,3,11,"I indeed baptize you in water to repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit, and"
40,3,12,"Whose fan"
40,3,13,"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan to John, to be baptized by him."
40,3,14,"But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?"
40,3,15,"And Jesus answering said to him, Permit"
40,3,16,"And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up immediately out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:"
40,3,17,"And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
40,4,1,"Then was Jesus led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil."
40,4,2,"And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward hungry."
40,4,3,"And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread."
40,4,4,"But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God."
40,4,5,"Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,"
40,4,6,"And saith to him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in"
40,4,7,"Jesus said to him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."
40,4,8,"Again, the devil taketh him up upon an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;"
40,4,9,"And saith to him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me."
40,4,10,"Then saith Jesus to him, Away with thee, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."
40,4,11,"Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered to him."
40,4,12,"Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;"
40,4,13,"And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali:"
40,4,14,"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,"
40,4,15,"The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali,"
40,4,16,"The people who sat in darkness saw great light; and to them who sat in the region and shadow of death light hath shone."
40,4,17,"From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
40,4,18,"And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen."
40,4,19,"And he saith to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
40,4,20,"And they immediately left"
40,4,21,"And going on from there, he saw other two brethren, James"
40,4,22,"And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him."
40,4,23,"And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people."
40,4,24,"And his fame spread throughout all Syria: and they brought to him all sick people that were sick with various diseases and torments, and those who were possessed with demons, and those who were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them."
40,4,25,"And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and"
40,5,1,"And seeing the multitudes, he went up to a mountain: and when he was seated, his disciples came to him:"
40,5,2,"And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,"
40,5,3,"Blessed"
40,5,4,"Blessed"
40,5,5,"Blessed"
40,5,6,"Blessed"
40,5,7,"Blessed"
40,5,8,"Blessed"
40,5,9,"Blessed"
40,5,10,"Blessed"
40,5,11,"Blessed are ye, when"
40,5,12,"Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great"
40,5,13,"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt hath lost its savour, how shall it be salted? it is then good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot by men."
40,5,14,"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid."
40,5,15,"Neither do men light a lamp, and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand; and it giveth light to all that are in the house."
40,5,16,"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven."
40,5,17,"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."
40,5,18,"For verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth shall pass away, one jot or one tittle shall by no means pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."
40,5,19,"Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do and teach"
40,5,20,"For I say to you, That except your righteousness shall exceed"
40,5,21,"Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:"
40,5,22,"But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire."
40,5,23,"Therefore if thou shalt bring thy gift to the altar, and there remember that thy brother hath any thing against thee;"
40,5,24,"Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift."
40,5,25,"Agree with thy adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison."
40,5,26,"Verily I say to thee, Thou shalt by no means come out from there, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing."
40,5,27,"Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:"
40,5,28,"But I say to you, That whoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."
40,5,29,"And if thy right eye shall cause thee to sin, pluck it out, and cast"
40,5,30,"And if thy right hand shall cause thee to sin, cut it off, and cast"
40,5,31,"It hath been said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:"
40,5,32,"But I say to you, That whoever shall put away his wife, except for the cause of immorality, causeth her to commit adultery: and whoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery."
40,5,33,"Again, ye have heard that it hath been said to them of old time, Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shalt perform to the Lord thy oaths:"
40,5,34,"But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:"
40,5,35,"Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King."
40,5,36,"Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black."
40,5,37,"But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatever is more than these cometh of evil."
40,5,38,"Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:"
40,5,39,"But I say to you, That ye resist not evil: but whoever shall strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."
40,5,40,"And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have"
40,5,41,"And whoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two."
40,5,42,"Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away."
40,5,43,"Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thy enemy."
40,5,44,"But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you, and persecute you;"
40,5,45,"That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust."
40,5,46,"For if ye love them who love you, what reward have ye? do not even the tax collectors the same?"
40,5,47,"And if ye greet your brethren only, what do ye more"
40,5,48,"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect."
40,6,1,"Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen by them: otherwise ye have no reward from your Father who is in heaven."
40,6,2,"Therefore when thou doest"
40,6,3,"But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:"
40,6,4,"That thy alms may be in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly."
40,6,5,"And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites"
40,6,6,"But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly."
40,6,7,"But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen"
40,6,8,"Therefore, be ye not like them: for your Father knoweth what things ye need, before ye ask him."
40,6,9,"After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name."
40,6,10,"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as"
40,6,11,"Give us this day our daily bread."
40,6,12,"And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."
40,6,13,"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen."
40,6,14,"For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:"
40,6,15,"But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
40,6,16,"Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to fast. Verily I say to you, They have their reward."
40,6,17,"But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;"
40,6,18,"That thou mayest not appear to men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly."
40,6,19,"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:"
40,6,20,"But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:"
40,6,21,"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
40,6,22,"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thy eye is clear, thy whole body shall be full of light."
40,6,23,"But if thy eye is bad, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee is darkness, how great"
40,6,24,"No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and riches."
40,6,25,"Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than raiment?"
40,6,26,"Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?"
40,6,27,"Which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?"
40,6,28,"And why are ye anxious for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:"
40,6,29,"And yet I say to you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
40,6,30,"Therefore, if God so clotheth the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven,"
40,6,31,"Therefore be not anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?"
40,6,32,"(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things."
40,6,33,"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you."
40,6,34,"Therefore be not anxious for to morrow: for to morrow will be anxious for the things of itself. Sufficient to the day"
40,7,1,"Judge not, that ye be not judged."
40,7,2,"For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with the measure which ye measure with, it shall be measured to you again."
40,7,3,"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thy own eye?"
40,7,4,"Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thy eye; and, behold, a beam"
40,7,5,"Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thy own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye."
40,7,6,"Give not that which is holy to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you."
40,7,7,"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you:"
40,7,8,"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."
40,7,9,"Or what man is there of you, who if his son shall ask bread, will give him a stone?"
40,7,10,"Or if he shall ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?"
40,7,11,"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?"
40,7,12,"Therefore all things whatever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets."
40,7,13,"Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide"
40,7,14,"Because small"
40,7,15,"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves."
40,7,16,"Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?"
40,7,17,"Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth bad fruit."
40,7,18,"A good tree cannot bring forth bad fruit, neither"
40,7,19,"Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
40,7,20,"Therefore by their fruits ye shall know them."
40,7,21,"Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven."
40,7,22,"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out demons? and in thy name done many wonderful works?"
40,7,23,"And then will I profess to them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity."
40,7,24,"Therefore whoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house upon a rock:"
40,7,25,"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock."
40,7,26,"And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:"
40,7,27,"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was its fall."
40,7,28,"And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:"
40,7,29,"For he taught them as"
40,8,1,"When he had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him."
40,8,2,"And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean."
40,8,3,"And Jesus put forth"
40,8,4,"And Jesus saith to him, See thou tell no man; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
40,8,5,"And when Jesus had entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,"
40,8,6,"And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick with the palsy, grievously tormented."
40,8,7,"And Jesus saith to him, I will come and heal him."
40,8,8,"The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed."
40,8,9,"For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this"
40,8,10,"When Jesus heard"
40,8,11,"And I say to you, That many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven."
40,8,12,"But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40,8,13,"And Jesus said to the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed,"
40,8,14,"And when Jesus had come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying, and sick with a fever."
40,8,15,"And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered to them."
40,8,16,"When the evening was come, they brought to him many that were possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits with"
40,8,17,"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, He himself took our infirmities, and bore"
40,8,18,"Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart to the other side."
40,8,19,"And a certain scribe came, and said to him, Master, I will follow thee wherever thou goest."
40,8,20,"And Jesus saith to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air"
40,8,21,"And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."
40,8,22,"But Jesus said to him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead."
40,8,23,"And when he had entered into a boat, his disciples followed him."
40,8,24,"And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was asleep."
40,8,25,"And his disciples came to"
40,8,26,"And he saith to them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm."
40,8,27,"But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!"
40,8,28,"And when he had come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with demons, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way."
40,8,29,"And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come here to torment us before the time?"
40,8,30,"And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding."
40,8,31,"So the demons besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine."
40,8,32,"And he said to them, Go. And when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters."
40,8,33,"And they that kept them fled, and went away into the city, and told every thing, and what had befallen to the"
40,8,34,"And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought"
40,9,1,"And he entered into a boat, and passed over, and came into his own city."
40,9,2,"And, behold, they brought to him a man sick with the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the sick with the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven thee."
40,9,3,"And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This"
40,9,4,"And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Why think ye evil in your hearts?"
40,9,5,"For which is easier, to say,"
40,9,6,"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick with the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go to thy house."
40,9,7,"And he arose, and departed to his house."
40,9,8,"But when the multitudes saw"
40,9,9,"And as Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the tax office: and he saith to him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him."
40,9,10,"And it came to pass, as Jesus sat"
40,9,11,"And when the Pharisees saw"
40,9,12,"But when Jesus heard"
40,9,13,"But go ye and learn what"
40,9,14,"Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but thy disciples fast not?"
40,9,15,"And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they shall fast."
40,9,16,"No man putteth a piece of new cloth to an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the tear is made worse."
40,9,17,"Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved."
40,9,18,"While he was speaking these things to them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live."
40,9,19,"And Jesus arose, and followed him, and"
40,9,20,"And, behold, a woman, who was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind"
40,9,21,"For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be healed."
40,9,22,"But Jesus turned himself about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee well. And the woman was healed from that hour."
40,9,23,"And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,"
40,9,24,"He said to them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed at him."
40,9,25,"But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose."
40,9,26,"And the fame of this went abroad into all that land."
40,9,27,"And when Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying,"
40,9,28,"And when he had come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith to them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said to him, Yea, Lord."
40,9,29,"Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it to you."
40,9,30,"And their eyes were opened; and Jesus sternly charged them, saying, See"
40,9,31,"But they, when they had departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country."
40,9,32,"As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon."
40,9,33,"And when the demon was cast out, the dumb spoke: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel."
40,9,34,"But the Pharisees said, He casteth out demons through the prince of the demons."
40,9,35,"And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people."
40,9,36,"But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they were faint, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd."
40,9,37,"Then saith he to his disciples, The harvest truly"
40,9,38,"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest."
40,10,1,"And when he had called to"
40,10,2,"Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James"
40,10,3,"Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James"
40,10,4,"Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him."
40,10,5,"These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and enter ye not into"
40,10,6,"But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
40,10,7,"And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand."
40,10,8,"Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons: freely ye have received, freely give."
40,10,9,"Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,"
40,10,10,"Nor bag for"
40,10,11,"And into whatever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go from there."
40,10,12,"And when ye come into an house, greet it."
40,10,13,"And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you."
40,10,14,"And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart from that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet."
40,10,15,"Verily I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city."
40,10,16,"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves."
40,10,17,"But beware of men: for they will deliver you to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;"
40,10,18,"And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles."
40,10,19,"But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given to you in that same hour what ye shall speak."
40,10,20,"For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaketh in you."
40,10,21,"And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against"
40,10,22,"And ye shall be hated by all"
40,10,23,"But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say to you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man shall have come."
40,10,24,"The disciple is not above"
40,10,25,"It is enough for the disciple that he should be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more"
40,10,26,"Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known."
40,10,27,"What I tell you in darkness,"
40,10,28,"And fear not them who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."
40,10,29,"Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father."
40,10,30,"But the very hairs of your head are all numbered."
40,10,31,"Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows."
40,10,32,"Whoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven."
40,10,33,"But whoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven."
40,10,34,"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword."
40,10,35,"For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."
40,10,36,"And a man’s foes"
40,10,37,"He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
40,10,38,"And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me."
40,10,39,"He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."
40,10,40,"He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me."
40,10,41,"He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward."
40,10,42,"And whoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold"
40,11,1,"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities."
40,11,2,"Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,"
40,11,3,"And said to him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?"
40,11,4,"Jesus answered and said to them, Go and show John again those things which ye hear and see:"
40,11,5,"The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them."
40,11,6,"And blessed is"
40,11,7,"And as they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?"
40,11,8,"But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft"
40,11,9,"But what went ye out to see? A prophet? yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet."
40,11,10,"For this is"
40,11,11,"Verily I say to you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: however he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
40,11,12,"And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force."
40,11,13,"For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John."
40,11,14,"And if ye will receive"
40,11,15,"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
40,11,16,"But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the markets, and calling to their companions,"
40,11,17,"And saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not lamented."
40,11,18,"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon."
40,11,19,"The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her children."
40,11,20,"Then he began to upbraid the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they repented not:"
40,11,21,"Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which had been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
40,11,22,"But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you."
40,11,23,"And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day."
40,11,24,"But I say to you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee."
40,11,25,"At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes."
40,11,26,"Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight."
40,11,27,"All things are delivered to me by my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, except the Son, and"
40,11,28,"Come to me, all"
40,11,29,"Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest to your souls."
40,11,30,"For my yoke"
40,12,1,"At that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the grain fields; and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the heads of grain, and to eat."
40,12,2,"But when the Pharisees saw"
40,12,3,"But he said to them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they that were with him;"
40,12,4,"How he entered into the house of God, and ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them who were with him, but only for the priests?"
40,12,5,"Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?"
40,12,6,"But I say to you, That in this place is"
40,12,7,"But if ye had known what"
40,12,8,"For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath."
40,12,9,"And when he had departed from there, he went into their synagogue:"
40,12,10,"And, behold, there was a man who had"
40,12,11,"And he said to them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it shall fall into a pit on the sabbath, will he not lay hold on it, and lift"
40,12,12,"How much then is a man better than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath days."
40,12,13,"Then saith he to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched"
40,12,14,"Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him."
40,12,15,"But when Jesus knew"
40,12,16,"And charged them that they should not make him known:"
40,12,17,"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,"
40,12,18,"Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall show justice to the Gentiles."
40,12,19,"He shall not quarrel, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets."
40,12,20,"A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he shall send forth justice to victory."
40,12,21,"And in his name shall the Gentiles trust."
40,12,22,"Then was brought to him one possessed with a demon, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw."
40,12,23,"And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?"
40,12,24,"But when the Pharisees heard"
40,12,25,"And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:"
40,12,26,"And if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?"
40,12,27,"And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your children cast"
40,12,28,"But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you."
40,12,29,"Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and seize his goods, except he shall first bind the strong man? and then he will plunder his house."
40,12,30,"He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad."
40,12,31,"Therefore I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy"
40,12,32,"And whoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaketh against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the"
40,12,33,"Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by"
40,12,34,"O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh."
40,12,35,"A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things."
40,12,36,"But I say to you, That for every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account for it in the day of judgment."
40,12,37,"For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned."
40,12,38,"Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee."
40,12,39,"But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh for a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah:"
40,12,40,"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."
40,12,41,"The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah"
40,12,42,"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon"
40,12,43,"When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and he findeth none."
40,12,44,"Then he saith, I will return into my house from which I came out; and when he is come, he findeth"
40,12,45,"Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last"
40,12,46,"While he was yet speaking to the people, behold,"
40,12,47,"Then one said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand outside, desiring to speak with thee."
40,12,48,"But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?"
40,12,49,"And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!"
40,12,50,"For whoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother."
40,13,1,"The same day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the sea side."
40,13,2,"And great multitudes were gathered together to him, so that he went into a boat, and sat down; and the whole multitude stood on the shore."
40,13,3,"And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;"
40,13,4,"And when he sowed, some"
40,13,5,"Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and immediately they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:"
40,13,6,"And when the sun had risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away."
40,13,7,"And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:"
40,13,8,"But others fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold."
40,13,9,"Who hath ears to hear, let him hear."
40,13,10,"And the disciples came, and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?"
40,13,11,"He answered and said to them, Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given."
40,13,12,"For whoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath."
40,13,13,"Therefore I speak to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand."
40,13,14,"And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:"
40,13,15,"For this people’s heart has become dull, and"
40,13,16,"But blessed"
40,13,17,"For verily I say to you, That many prophets and righteous"
40,13,18,"Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower."
40,13,19,"When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth"
40,13,20,"But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and immediately with joy receiveth it;"
40,13,21,"Yet he hath not root in himself, but endureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, immediately he is offended."
40,13,22,"He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful."
40,13,23,"But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth"
40,13,24,"Another parable he put forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man who sowed good seed in his field:"
40,13,25,"But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way."
40,13,26,"But when the blade had sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also."
40,13,27,"So the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? how then hath it tares?"
40,13,28,"He said to them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said to him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?"
40,13,29,"But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them."
40,13,30,"Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn."
40,13,31,"Another parable he put forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:"
40,13,32,"Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge on its branches."
40,13,33,"Another parable he spoke to them; The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
40,13,34,"All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables; and without a parable he spoke not to them:"
40,13,35,"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world."
40,13,36,"Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Make known to us"
40,13,37,"He answered and said to them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;"
40,13,38,"The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked"
40,13,39,"The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels."
40,13,40,"As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world."
40,13,41,"The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them who do iniquity;"
40,13,42,"And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."
40,13,43,"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear."
40,13,44,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a field; which when a man hath found, he hideth, and from joy over it goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field."
40,13,45,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant man, seeking fine pearls:"
40,13,46,"Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it."
40,13,47,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:"
40,13,48,"Which, when it was full, they drew to the shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast away the bad."
40,13,49,"So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous,"
40,13,50,"And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."
40,13,51,"Jesus saith to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yea, Lord."
40,13,52,"Then said he to them, Therefore every scribe"
40,13,53,"And it came to pass,"
40,13,54,"And when he had come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, How hath this"
40,13,55,"Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?"
40,13,56,"And his sisters, are they not all with us? How then hath this"
40,13,57,"And they were offended in him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, except in his own country, and in his own house."
40,13,58,"And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief."
40,14,1,"At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,"
40,14,2,"And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he hath risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him."
40,14,3,"For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put"
40,14,4,"For John had said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her."
40,14,5,"And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet."
40,14,6,"But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod."
40,14,7,"Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask."
40,14,8,"And she, being before instructed by her mother, said, Give me here the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
40,14,9,"And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the sake of the oath and them who sat eating with him, he commanded"
40,14,10,"And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison."
40,14,11,"And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the girl: and she brought"
40,14,12,"And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus."
40,14,13,"When Jesus heard"
40,14,14,"And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick."
40,14,15,"And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now late; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food."
40,14,16,"But Jesus said to them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat."
40,14,17,"And they say to him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes."
40,14,18,"He said, Bring them here to me."
40,14,19,"And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke, and gave the loaves to"
40,14,20,"And they all ate, and were satisfied: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full."
40,14,21,"And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children."
40,14,22,"And immediately Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a boat, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away."
40,14,23,"And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up to a mountain by himself to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone."
40,14,24,"But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary."
40,14,25,"And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea."
40,14,26,"And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear."
40,14,27,"But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid."
40,14,28,"And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it is thou, bid me come to thee on the water."
40,14,29,"And he said, Come. And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus."
40,14,30,"But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me."
40,14,31,"And immediately Jesus stretched forth"
40,14,32,"And when they had come into the boat, the wind ceased."
40,14,33,"Then they that were in the boat came and worshipped him, saying, In truth thou art the Son of God."
40,14,34,"And when they had gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret."
40,14,35,"And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all the surrounding country, and brought to him all that were diseased;"
40,14,36,"And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly well."
40,15,1,"Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, who were of Jerusalem, saying,"
40,15,2,"Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread."
40,15,3,"But he answered and said to them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?"
40,15,4,"For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death."
40,15,5,"But ye say, Whoever shall say to"
40,15,6,"And honour not his father or his mother,"
40,15,7,""
40,15,8,"This people draweth near to me with their mouth, and honour me with"
40,15,9,"But in vain they do worship me, teaching"
40,15,10,"And he called the multitude, and said to them, Hear, and understand:"
40,15,11,"Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man."
40,15,12,"Then came his disciples, and said to him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?"
40,15,13,"But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted out."
40,15,14,"Let them alone: they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leadeth the blind, both shall fall into the ditch."
40,15,15,"Then answered Peter and said to him, Make known to us"
40,15,16,"And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?"
40,15,17,"Do ye not yet understand, that whatever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the stomach, and is cast out into the draught?"
40,15,18,"But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man."
40,15,19,"For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:"
40,15,20,"These are"
40,15,21,"Then Jesus went from there, and departed into the region of Tyre and Sidon."
40,15,22,"And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same region, and cried to him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord,"
40,15,23,"But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us."
40,15,24,"But he answered and said, I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
40,15,25,"Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me."
40,15,26,"But he answered and said, It is not good to take the children’s bread, and to cast"
40,15,27,"And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table."
40,15,28,"Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great"
40,15,29,"And Jesus departed from there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and went up on a mountain, and sat down there."
40,15,30,"And great multitudes came to him, having with them"
40,15,31,"So that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel."
40,15,32,"Then Jesus called his disciples"
40,15,33,"And his disciples say to him, Where should we get so much bread in the wilderness, as to satisfy so great a multitude?"
40,15,34,"And Jesus saith to them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes."
40,15,35,"And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground."
40,15,36,"And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and broke"
40,15,37,"And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up of the broken pieces that were left seven baskets full."
40,15,38,"And they that had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children."
40,15,39,"And he sent away the multitude, and got into a boat, and came into the region of Magdala."
40,16,1,"The Pharisees also and the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven."
40,16,2,"He answered and said to them, When it is evening, ye say,"
40,16,3,"And in the morning,"
40,16,4,"A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh for a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah. And he left them, and departed."
40,16,5,"And when his disciples had come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread."
40,16,6,"Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees."
40,16,7,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying,"
40,16,8,""
40,16,9,"Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?"
40,16,10,"Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?"
40,16,11,"How is it that ye do not understand that I spoke not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?"
40,16,12,"Then they understood that he did not warn"
40,16,13,"When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I the Son of man am?"
40,16,14,"And they said, Some"
40,16,15,"He saith to them, But who say ye that I am?"
40,16,16,"And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
40,16,17,"And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed"
40,16,18,"And I say also to thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
40,16,19,"And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
40,16,20,"Then he charged his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ."
40,16,21,"From that time forth Jesus began to show to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day."
40,16,22,"Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be to thee."
40,16,23,"But he turned, and said to Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence to me: for thou savourest not the things that are of God, but those that are of men."
40,16,24,"Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any"
40,16,25,"For whoever will save his life shall lose it: and whoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it."
40,16,26,"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"
40,16,27,"For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works."
40,16,28,"Verily I say to you, There are some standing here, who shall not taste death, till they shall see the Son of man coming in his kingdom."
40,17,1,"And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up upon an high mountain by themselves,"
40,17,2,"And he was transfigured before them: and his face shone as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light."
40,17,3,"And, behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him."
40,17,4,"Then answered Peter, and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
40,17,5,"While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him."
40,17,6,"And when the disciples heard"
40,17,7,"And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid."
40,17,8,"And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, except Jesus only."
40,17,9,"And as they came down the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man is risen from the dead."
40,17,10,"And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come?"
40,17,11,"And Jesus answered and said to them, Elijah truly shall first come, and restore all things."
40,17,12,"But I say to you, That Elijah is come already, and they knew him not, but have done to him whatever they desired. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer by them."
40,17,13,"Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them concerning John the Baptist."
40,17,14,"And when they had come to the multitude, there came to him a"
40,17,15,"Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatic, and greatly distressed: for often he falleth into the fire, and often into the water."
40,17,16,"And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him."
40,17,17,"Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him here to me."
40,17,18,"And Jesus rebuked the demon; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour."
40,17,19,"Then came the disciples to Jesus privately, and said, Why could not we cast him out?"
40,17,20,"And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say to you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to this mountain, Move from here to yonder place; and it shall move; and nothing shall be impossible to you."
40,17,21,"However this kind goeth not out except by prayer and fasting."
40,17,22,"And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:"
40,17,23,"And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceedingly sorrowful."
40,17,24,"And when they had come to Capernaum, they that received tribute"
40,17,25,"He saith, Yes. And when he had come into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? from their own children, or from strangers?"
40,17,26,"Peter saith to him, From strangers. Jesus saith to him, Then are the children free."
40,17,27,"However, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: take that, and give to them for me and thee."
40,18,1,"At the same time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
40,18,2,"And Jesus called a little child to him, and set him in the midst of them,"
40,18,3,"And said, Verily I say to you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."
40,18,4,"Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
40,18,5,"And whoever shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me."
40,18,6,"But whoever shall cause one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it were better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck, and"
40,18,7,"Woe to the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!"
40,18,8,"Therefore if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to sin, cut them off, and cast"
40,18,9,"And if thy eye causeth thee to sin, pluck it out, and cast"
40,18,10,"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven."
40,18,11,"For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost."
40,18,12,"How think ye? if a man hath an hundred sheep, and one of them is gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and go to the mountains, and seek that which is gone astray?"
40,18,13,"And if so be that he findeth it, verily I say to you, he rejoiceth more over that"
40,18,14,"Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish."
40,18,15,"Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother."
40,18,16,"But if he will not hear"
40,18,17,"And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell"
40,18,18,"Verily I say to you, Whatever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
40,18,19,"Again I say to you, That if two of you shall agree on earth concerning any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven."
40,18,20,"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them."
40,18,21,"Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?"
40,18,22,"Jesus saith to him, I say not to thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."
40,18,23,"Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a certain king, who would take account of his servants."
40,18,24,"And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought to him, who owed him ten thousand talents."
40,18,25,"But as he had nothing with which to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made."
40,18,26,"The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all."
40,18,27,"Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt."
40,18,28,"But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, who owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took"
40,18,29,"And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all."
40,18,30,"And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt."
40,18,31,"So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done."
40,18,32,"Then his lord, having called him, said to him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou didst beg me:"
40,18,33,"Shouldest thou not also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?"
40,18,34,"And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the torturers, till he should pay all that was due to him."
40,18,35,"So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also to you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses."
40,19,1,"And it came to pass,"
40,19,2,"And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there."
40,19,3,"The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?"
40,19,4,"And he answered and said to them, Have ye not read, that he who made"
40,19,5,"And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they two shall be one flesh?"
40,19,6,"Therefore they are no more two, but one flesh. Therefore what God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."
40,19,7,"They say to him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?"
40,19,8,"He saith to them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts permitted you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so."
40,19,9,"And I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, except for immorality, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoever marrieth her who is put away committeth adultery."
40,19,10,"His disciples say to him, If the case of the man is so with"
40,19,11,"But he said to them, All"
40,19,12,"For there are some eunuchs, who were so born from"
40,19,13,"Then were brought to him little children, that he should put"
40,19,14,"But Jesus said, Permit"
40,19,15,"And he laid"
40,19,16,"And, behold, one came and said to him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"
40,19,17,"And he said to him, Why callest thou me good?"
40,19,18,"He saith to him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,"
40,19,19,"Honour thy father and"
40,19,20,"The young man saith to him, All these things have I kept from my youth: what lack I yet?"
40,19,21,"Jesus said to him, If thou wilt be perfect, go"
40,19,22,"But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions."
40,19,23,"Then said Jesus to his disciples, Verily I say to you, That it is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven."
40,19,24,"And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
40,19,25,"When his disciples heard"
40,19,26,"But Jesus beheld"
40,19,27,"Then answered Peter and said to him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?"
40,19,28,"And Jesus said to them, Verily I say to you, That ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
40,19,29,"And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life."
40,19,30,"But many"
40,20,1,"For the kingdom of heaven is like a man"
40,20,2,"And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard."
40,20,3,"And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,"
40,20,4,"And said to them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went."
40,20,5,"Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did the same."
40,20,6,"And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith to them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?"
40,20,7,"They say to him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatever is right,"
40,20,8,"So when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward, Call the labourers, and give them"
40,20,9,"And when they came that"
40,20,10,"But when the first came, they supposed that they should receive more; and they likewise received every man a penny."
40,20,11,"And when they had received"
40,20,12,"Saying, These last have worked"
40,20,13,"But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?"
40,20,14,"Take"
40,20,15,"Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own? Is thy eye evil, because I am good?"
40,20,16,"So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many are called, but few chosen."
40,20,17,"And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples aside in the way, and said to them,"
40,20,18,"Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,"
40,20,19,"And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify"
40,20,20,"Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children with her sons, worshipping"
40,20,21,"And he said to her, What wilt thou? She saith to him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom."
40,20,22,"But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able."
40,20,23,"And he saith to them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but"
40,20,24,"And when the ten heard"
40,20,25,"But Jesus called them"
40,20,26,"But it shall not be so among you: but whoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;"
40,20,27,"And whoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:"
40,20,28,"Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."
40,20,29,"And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him."
40,20,30,"And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord,"
40,20,31,"And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord,"
40,20,32,"And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do to you?"
40,20,33,"They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened."
40,20,34,"So Jesus had compassion"
40,21,1,"And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and had come to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,"
40,21,2,"Saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately ye shall find a donkey tied, and a colt with her: loose"
40,21,3,"And if any"
40,21,4,"All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,"
40,21,5,"Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh to thee, meek, and sitting upon a donkey, and a colt the foal of a donkey."
40,21,6,"And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,"
40,21,7,"And brought the donkey, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set"
40,21,8,"And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and spread"
40,21,9,"And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed"
40,21,10,"And when he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?"
40,21,11,"And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee."
40,21,12,"And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,"
40,21,13,"And said to them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves."
40,21,14,"And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them."
40,21,15,"And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were greatly displeased,"
40,21,16,"And said to him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith to them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?"
40,21,17,"And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there."
40,21,18,"Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he was hungry."
40,21,19,"And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing on it, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away."
40,21,20,"And when the disciples saw"
40,21,21,"Jesus answered and said to them, Verily I say to you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this"
40,21,22,"And all things, whatever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive."
40,21,23,"And when he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?"
40,21,24,"And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things."
40,21,25,"The baptism of John, where was it from? from heaven, or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did ye not believe him?"
40,21,26,"But if we shall say, From men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet."
40,21,27,"And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things."
40,21,28,"But what think ye? A"
40,21,29,"He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went."
40,21,30,"And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I"
40,21,31,"Which of the two did the will of"
40,21,32,"For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen"
40,21,33,"Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, who planted a vineyard, and hedged around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to vinedressers, and went into a far country:"
40,21,34,"And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive its fruits."
40,21,35,"And the vinedressers took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another."
40,21,36,"Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did to them in like manner."
40,21,37,"But last of all he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son."
40,21,38,"But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance."
40,21,39,"And they caught him, and cast"
40,21,40,"When therefore the lord of the vineyard cometh, what will he do to those vinedressers?"
40,21,41,"They say to him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out"
40,21,42,"Jesus saith to them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?"
40,21,43,"Therefore I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits of it."
40,21,44,"And whoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."
40,21,45,"And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them."
40,21,46,"But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they regarded him as a prophet."
40,22,1,"And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables, and said,"
40,22,2,"The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage for his son,"
40,22,3,"And sent his servants to call them that were invited to the wedding: and they would not come."
40,22,4,"Again, he sent other servants, saying, Tell them who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and"
40,22,5,"But they made light of"
40,22,6,"And the remnant took his servants, and treated"
40,22,7,"But when the king heard"
40,22,8,"Then he saith to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they who were invited were not worthy."
40,22,9,"Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, invite to the marriage."
40,22,10,"So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests."
40,22,11,"And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who had not a wedding garment:"
40,22,12,"And he saith to him, Friend, how camest thou in here not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless."
40,22,13,"Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast"
40,22,14,"For many are called, but few"
40,22,15,"Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in"
40,22,16,"And they sent out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any"
40,22,17,"Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?"
40,22,18,"But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me,"
40,22,19,"Show me the tribute money. And they brought to him a penny."
40,22,20,"And he saith to them, Whose"
40,22,21,"They say to him, Caesar’s. Then saith he to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and to God the things that are God’s."
40,22,22,"When they had heard"
40,22,23,"The same day came to him the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,"
40,22,24,"Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother."
40,22,25,"Now there were with us seven brothers: and the first, when he had married a wife, died, and, having no issue, left his wife to his brother:"
40,22,26,"Likewise the second also, and the third, to the seventh."
40,22,27,"And last of all the woman died also."
40,22,28,"Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her."
40,22,29,"Jesus answered and said to them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God."
40,22,30,"For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven."
40,22,31,"But as concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,"
40,22,32,"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
40,22,33,"And when the multitude heard"
40,22,34,"But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together about him."
40,22,35,"Then one of them,"
40,22,36,"Master, which"
40,22,37,"Jesus said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind."
40,22,38,"This is the first and great commandment."
40,22,39,"And the second"
40,22,40,"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."
40,22,41,"While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,"
40,22,42,"Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him,"
40,22,43,"He saith to them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,"
40,22,44,"The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool?"
40,22,45,"If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?"
40,22,46,"And no man was able to answer him a word, neither dared any"
40,23,1,"Then Jesus spoke to the multitude, and to his disciples,"
40,23,2,"Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in the seat of Moses:"
40,23,3,"All therefore whatever they bid you observe,"
40,23,4,"For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay"
40,23,5,"But all their works they do to be seen by men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,"
40,23,6,"And love the uppermost places at feasts, and the best seats in the synagogues,"
40,23,7,"And greetings in the markets, and to be called by men, Rabbi, Rabbi."
40,23,8,"But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master,"
40,23,9,"And call no"
40,23,10,"Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master,"
40,23,11,"But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant."
40,23,12,"And whoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted."
40,23,13,"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in"
40,23,14,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation."
40,23,15,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye travel sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves."
40,23,16,"Woe to you,"
40,23,17,""
40,23,18,"And, Whoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is bound."
40,23,19,""
40,23,20,"Whoever therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things on it."
40,23,21,"And whoever shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth in it."
40,23,22,"And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth upon it."
40,23,23,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier"
40,23,24,""
40,23,25,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess."
40,23,26,""
40,23,27,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like whitewashed sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead"
40,23,28,"Thus ye also outwardly appear righteous to men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity."
40,23,29,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,"
40,23,30,"And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets."
40,23,31,"Therefore ye are witnesses against yourselves, that ye are the children of them who killed the prophets."
40,23,32,"Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers."
40,23,33,""
40,23,34,"Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and"
40,23,35,"That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar."
40,23,36,"Verily I say to you, All these things shall come upon this generation."
40,23,37,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,"
40,23,38,"Behold, your house is left to you desolate."
40,23,39,"For I say to you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed"
40,24,1,"And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to"
40,24,2,"And Jesus said to them, See ye not all these things? verily I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
40,24,3,"And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what"
40,24,4,"And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no man deceive you."
40,24,5,"For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many."
40,24,6,"And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all"
40,24,7,"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in various places."
40,24,8,"All these"
40,24,9,"Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated by all nations for my name’s sake."
40,24,10,"And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another."
40,24,11,"And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many."
40,24,12,"And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall become cold."
40,24,13,"But he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved."
40,24,14,"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a testimony to all nations; and then shall the end come."
40,24,15,"When therefore ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever readeth, let him understand:)"
40,24,16,"Then let them who are in Judaea flee to the mountains:"
40,24,17,"Let him who is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:"
40,24,18,"Neither let him who is in the field return back to take his clothes."
40,24,19,"And woe to them that are with child, and to them that nurse infants in those days!"
40,24,20,"But pray ye that your flight may not be in the winter, neither on the sabbath:"
40,24,21,"For then shall be great tribulation, such as hath not been since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be."
40,24,22,"And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened."
40,24,23,"Then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here"
40,24,24,"For false Christs will arise, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so that, if"

40,24,28,"For wherever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together."
40,24,29,"Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:"
40,24,30,"And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."
40,24,31,"And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other."
40,24,32,"Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When its branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer"
40,24,33,"So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near,"
40,24,34,"Verily I say to you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things shall be fulfilled."
40,24,35,"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."
40,24,36,"But of that day and hour knoweth no"
40,24,37,"But as the days of Noah"
40,24,38,"For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,"
40,24,39,"And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so also will be the coming of the Son of man."

40,25,7,"Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps."
40,25,8,"And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out."
40,25,9,"But the wise answered, saying,"
40,25,10,"And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut."
40,25,11,"Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us."
40,25,12,"But he answered and said, Verily I say to you, I know you not."
40,25,13,"Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of man cometh."
40,25,14,"For"
40,25,15,"And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his own ability; and immediately took his journey."
40,25,16,"Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and gained other five talents."
40,25,17,"And likewise he that"
40,25,18,"But he that had received one went and dug in the earth, and hid his lord’s money."
40,25,19,"After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them."
40,25,20,"And he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou didst deliver to me five talents: behold, I have gained besides them five talents more."
40,25,21,"His lord said to him, Well done,"
40,25,22,"He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou didst deliver to me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents besides them."
40,25,23,"His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."
40,25,24,"Then he who had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not scattered seed:"
40,25,25,"And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo,"
40,25,26,"His lord answered and said to him,"
40,25,27,"Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money in the bank, and"
40,25,28,"Take therefore the talent from him, and give"
40,25,29,"For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath."
40,25,30,"And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40,25,31,"When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:"
40,25,32,"And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth"
40,25,33,"And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left."
40,25,34,"Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:"
40,25,35,"For I was hungry, and ye gave me food: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:"
40,25,36,"Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came to me."
40,25,37,"Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed"
40,25,38,"When saw we thee a stranger, and took"
40,25,39,"Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came to thee?"
40,25,40,"And the King shall answer and say to them, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye have done"
40,25,41,"Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:"
40,25,42,"For I was hungry, and ye gave me no food: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:"
40,25,43,"I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not."
40,25,44,"Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?"
40,25,45,"Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did"
40,25,46,"And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal."
40,26,1,"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,"
40,26,2,"Ye know that after two days is the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified."
40,26,3,"Then assembled the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,"
40,26,4,"And consulted that they might take Jesus by guile, and kill"
40,26,5,"But they said, Not on the feast"
40,26,6,"Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,"
40,26,7,"There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he was eating."
40,26,8,"But when his disciples saw"
40,26,9,"For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor."
40,26,10,"When Jesus understood"
40,26,11,"For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always."
40,26,12,"For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did"
40,26,13,"Verily I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world,"
40,26,14,"Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,"
40,26,15,"And said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they agreed with him for thirty pieces of silver."
40,26,16,"And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him."
40,26,17,"Now the first"
40,26,18,"And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples."
40,26,19,"And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover."
40,26,20,"Now when the evening was come, he sat down with the twelve."
40,26,21,"And as they were eating, he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall betray me."
40,26,22,"And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say to him, Lord, is it I?"
40,26,23,"And he answered and said, He that dippeth"
40,26,24,"The Son of man goeth as it is written concerning him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born."
40,26,25,"Then Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said to him, Thou hast said."
40,26,26,"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed"
40,26,27,"And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave"
40,26,28,"For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins."
40,26,29,"But I say to you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom."
40,26,30,"And when they had sung an hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives."
40,26,31,"Then saith Jesus to them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad."
40,26,32,"But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee."
40,26,33,"Peter answered and said to him, Though all"
40,26,34,"Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, That this night, before the cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me three times."
40,26,35,"Peter said to him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples."
40,26,36,"Then cometh Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and saith to the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder, and pray."
40,26,37,"And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy."
40,26,38,"Then saith he to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even to death: tarry ye here, and watch with me."
40,26,39,"And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou"
40,26,40,"And he cometh to the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith to Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?"
40,26,41,"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed"
40,26,42,"He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done."
40,26,43,"And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy."
40,26,44,"And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words."
40,26,45,"Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith to them, Sleep on now, and take"
40,26,46,"Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me."
40,26,47,"And while he was yet speaking, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staffs, from the chief priests and elders of the people."
40,26,48,"Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast."
40,26,49,"And immediately he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him."
40,26,50,"And Jesus said to him, Friend, why art thou come? Then they came, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him."
40,26,51,"And, behold, one of them who were with Jesus stretched out"
40,26,52,"Then said Jesus to him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword."
40,26,53,"Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?"
40,26,54,"But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?"
40,26,55,"In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staffs to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me."
40,26,56,"But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled."
40,26,57,"And they that had laid hold on Jesus led"
40,26,58,"But Peter followed him from afar off to the high priest’s courtyard, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end."
40,26,59,"Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false testimony against Jesus, to put him to death;"
40,26,60,"But found none: and, though many false witnesses came,"
40,26,61,"And said, This"
40,26,62,"And the high priest arose, and said to him, Answerest thou nothing? what"
40,26,63,"But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God."
40,26,64,"Jesus saith to him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say to you, After this shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."
40,26,65,"Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy."
40,26,66,"What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death."
40,26,67,"Then they spat in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote"
40,26,68,"Saying, Prophesy to us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?"
40,26,69,"Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard: and a maid came to him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee."
40,26,70,"But he denied before"
40,26,71,"And when he had gone out into the porch, another"
40,26,72,"And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man."
40,26,73,"And after a while came to"
40,26,74,"Then began he to curse and to swear,"
40,26,75,"And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who said to him, Before the cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me three times. And he went out, and wept bitterly."
40,27,1,"When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:"
40,27,2,"And when they had bound him, they led"
40,27,3,"Then Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,"
40,27,4,"Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood. And they said, What"
40,27,5,"And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself."
40,27,6,"And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood."
40,27,7,"And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in."
40,27,8,"Therefore that field was called, The field of blood, to this day."
40,27,9,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;"
40,27,10,"And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me."
40,27,11,"And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, Thou sayest."
40,27,12,"And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing."
40,27,13,"Then saith Pilate to him, Hearest thou not how many things they testify against thee?"
40,27,14,"And he answered to him never a word; so that the governor marvelled greatly."
40,27,15,"Now at"
40,27,16,"And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas."
40,27,17,"Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
40,27,18,"For he knew that for envy they had delivered him."
40,27,19,"When he was seated on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."
40,27,20,"But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus."
40,27,21,"The governor answered and said to them, Which of the two will ye that I release to you? They said, Barabbas."
40,27,22,"Pilate saith to them, What shall I do then with Jesus who is called Christ?"
40,27,23,"And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified."
40,27,24,"When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but"
40,27,25,"Then answered all the people, and said, His blood"
40,27,26,"Then he released Barabbas to them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered"
40,27,27,"Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered to him the whole band"
40,27,28,"And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe."
40,27,29,"And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put"
40,27,30,"And they spat upon him, and took the reed, and struck him on the head."
40,27,31,"And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify"
40,27,32,"And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross."
40,27,33,"And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,"
40,27,34,"They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted"
40,27,35,"And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they cast lots."
40,27,36,"And sitting down they watched him there;"
40,27,37,"And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
40,27,38,"Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left."
40,27,39,"And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,"
40,27,40,"And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest"
40,27,41,"Likewise also the chief priests mocking"
40,27,42,"He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he is King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him."
40,27,43,"He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God."
40,27,44,"The thieves also, who were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth."
40,27,45,"Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land to the ninth hour."
40,27,46,"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
40,27,47,"Some of them that stood there, when they heard"
40,27,48,"And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled"
40,27,49,"The rest said, Forbear, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him."
40,27,50,"Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the spirit."
40,27,51,"And, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split;"
40,27,52,"And the graves were opened; and many bodies of saints who slept were raised,"
40,27,53,"And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared to many."
40,27,54,"Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God."
40,27,55,"And many women were there beholding from afar off, who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him:"
40,27,56,"Among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children."
40,27,57,"When the evening was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus:"
40,27,58,"He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered."
40,27,59,"And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,"
40,27,60,"And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed."
40,27,61,"And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the sepulchre."
40,27,62,"Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate,"
40,27,63,"Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again."
40,27,64,"Command therefore that the sepulchre be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first."
40,27,65,"Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch: go, make"
40,27,66,"So they went, and having sealed the stone, made the sepulchre secure, with a watch."
40,28,1,"In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first"
40,28,2,"And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it."
40,28,3,"His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:"
40,28,4,"And for fear of him the keepers shook, and became as dead"
40,28,5,"And the angel answered and said to the women, Fear ye not: for I know that ye seek Jesus, who was crucified."
40,28,6,"He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay."
40,28,7,"And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you."
40,28,8,"And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and ran to bring word to his disciples."
40,28,9,"And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him."
40,28,10,"Then said Jesus to them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me."
40,28,11,"Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and showed to the chief priests all the things that had happened."
40,28,12,"And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,"
40,28,13,"Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him"
40,28,14,"And if this shall come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you."
40,28,15,"So they took the money, and did as they were instructed: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day."
40,28,16,"Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to a mountain where Jesus had appointed them."
40,28,17,"And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted."
40,28,18,"And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority is given to me in heaven and upon earth."
40,28,19,"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit:"
40,28,20,"Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always,"
41,1,1,"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;"
41,1,2,"As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee."
41,1,3,"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
41,1,4,"John was baptizing in the wilderness, and preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins."
41,1,5,"And there went out to him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins."
41,1,6,"And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a leather belt around his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey;"
41,1,7,"And preached, saying, There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose."
41,1,8,"I indeed have baptized you in water: but he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit."
41,1,9,"And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth to Galilee, and was baptized by John in Jordan."
41,1,10,"And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:"
41,1,11,"And there came a voice from heaven,"
41,1,12,"And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness."
41,1,13,"And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him."
41,1,14,"Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,"
41,1,15,"And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel."
41,1,16,"Now as he was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen."
41,1,17,"And Jesus said to them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men."
41,1,18,"And immediately they forsook their nets, and followed him."
41,1,19,"And when he had gone a little further from there, he saw James the"
41,1,20,"And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him."
41,1,21,"And they went into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue, and taught."
41,1,22,"And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes."
41,1,23,"And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,"
41,1,24,"Saying, Let"
41,1,25,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him."
41,1,26,"And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him."
41,1,27,"And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine"
41,1,28,"And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region surrounding Galilee."
41,1,29,"And immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John."
41,1,30,"But the mother of Simon’s wife lay sick with a fever, and immediately they tell him of her."
41,1,31,"And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered to them."
41,1,32,"And at evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with demons."
41,1,33,"And all the city was gathered together at the door."
41,1,34,"And he healed many that were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and permitted not the demons to speak, because they knew him."
41,1,35,"And in the morning, rising a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed."
41,1,36,"And Simon and they that were with him followed after him."
41,1,37,"And when they had found him, they said to him, All"
41,1,38,"And he said to them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for this purpose have I come."
41,1,39,"And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out demons."
41,1,40,"And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean."
41,1,41,"And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth"
41,1,42,"And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed."
41,1,43,"And he strictly charged him, and immediately sent him away;"
41,1,44,"And saith to him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
41,1,45,"But he went out, and began to proclaim"
41,2,1,"And again he entered into Capernaum after"
41,2,2,"And immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no room to receive"
41,2,3,"And they come to him, bringing one sick with the palsy, who was borne by four."
41,2,4,"And when they could not come near to him by reason of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken"
41,2,5,"When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the sick with the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven thee."
41,2,6,"But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,"
41,2,7,"Why doth this"
41,2,8,"And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said to them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?"
41,2,9,"Which is easier to say to the sick with the palsy,"
41,2,10,"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick with the palsy,)"
41,2,11,"I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go into thy house."
41,2,12,"And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion."
41,2,13,"And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them."
41,2,14,"And as he passed by, he saw Levi the"
41,2,15,"And it came to pass, that, as Jesus was eating in his house, many tax collectors and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him."
41,2,16,"And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eating with tax collectors and sinners, they said to his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with tax collectors and sinners?"
41,2,17,"When Jesus heard"
41,2,18,"And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?"
41,2,19,"And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
41,2,20,"But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they shall fast in those days."
41,2,21,"No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the tear is made worse."
41,2,22,"And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles."
41,2,23,"And it came to pass, that he went through the grain fields on the sabbath; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the heads of grain."
41,2,24,"And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath that which is not lawful?"
41,2,25,"And he said to them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and they that were with him?"
41,2,26,"How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the showbread, which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them who were with him?"
41,2,27,"And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:"
41,2,28,"Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath."
41,3,1,"And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had a withered hand."
41,3,2,"And they watched him, to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath; that they might accuse him."
41,3,3,"And he saith to the man who had the withered hand, Stand forth."
41,3,4,"And he saith to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace."
41,3,5,"And when he had looked around on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched"
41,3,6,"And the Pharisees went forth, and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him."
41,3,7,"But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,"
41,3,8,"And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and"
41,3,9,"And he spoke to his disciples, that a small boat should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him."
41,3,10,"For he had healed many; so that they pressed upon him to touch him, as many as had afflictions."
41,3,11,"And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God."
41,3,12,"And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known."
41,3,13,"And he goeth up upon a mountain, and calleth"
41,3,14,"And he appointed twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,"
41,3,15,"And to have authority to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons:"
41,3,16,"And Simon he surnamed Peter;"
41,3,17,"And James the"
41,3,18,"And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the"
41,3,19,"And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him: and they went into an house."
41,3,20,"And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread."
41,3,21,"And when his friends heard"
41,3,22,"And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem sayd, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the demons he casteth out demons."
41,3,23,"And he called them"
41,3,24,"And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
41,3,25,"And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand."
41,3,26,"And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end."
41,3,27,"No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and plunder his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will plunder his house."
41,3,28,"Verily I say to you, All sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they shall blaspheme:"
41,3,29,"But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never hath forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:"
41,3,30,"Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit."
41,3,31,"There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing outside, they sent to him, calling him."
41,3,32,"And the multitude sat about him, and they said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee."
41,3,33,"And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?"
41,3,34,"And he looked around on them who sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!"
41,3,35,"For whoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother."
41,4,1,"And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered to him a great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat on the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land."
41,4,2,"And he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his doctrine,"
41,4,3,"Hearken; Behold, a sower went out to sow:"
41,4,4,"And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it."
41,4,5,"And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:"
41,4,6,"But when the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away."
41,4,7,"And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit."
41,4,8,"And other fell on good ground, and yielded fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred."
41,4,9,"And he said to them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
41,4,10,"And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable."
41,4,11,"And he said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are outside, all"
41,4,12,"That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and"
41,4,13,"And he said to them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?"
41,4,14,"The sower soweth the word."
41,4,15,"And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts."
41,4,16,"And these are they likewise who are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;"
41,4,17,"And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they fall away."
41,4,18,"And these are they who are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,"
41,4,19,"And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful."
41,4,20,"And these are they who are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive"
41,4,21,"And he said to them, Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket, or under a bed? and not to be set on a lampstand?"
41,4,22,"For there is nothing hid, which shall not be revealed; neither hath any thing been kept secret, but that it should come to light."
41,4,23,"If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear."
41,4,24,"And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear: with the measure which ye measure, it shall be measured to you: and to you that hear shall more be given."
41,4,25,"For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath."
41,4,26,"And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;"
41,4,27,"And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how."
41,4,28,"For the earth bringeth forth fruit of itself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the ripe grain in the head."
41,4,29,"But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come."
41,4,30,"And he said, To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?"
41,4,31,""
41,4,32,"But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under its shadow."
41,4,33,"And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear"
41,4,34,"But without a parable he spoke not to them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples."
41,4,35,"And the same day, when the evening was come, he saith to them, Let us pass over to the other side."
41,4,36,"And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the boat. And there were also with him other little boats."
41,4,37,"And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was now full."
41,4,38,"And he was in the stern of the boat, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say to him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?"
41,4,39,"And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm."
41,4,40,"And he said to them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?"
41,4,41,"And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
41,5,1,"And they came over to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes."
41,5,2,"And when he had come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,"
41,5,3,"Who had"
41,5,4,"For he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any"
41,5,5,"And always, night and day, he was on the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones."
41,5,6,"But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,"
41,5,7,"And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,"
41,5,8,"For he said to him, Come out of the man,"
41,5,9,"And he asked him, What"
41,5,10,"And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country."
41,5,11,"Now there was there near to the mountains a great herd of swine feeding."
41,5,12,"And all the demons besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them."
41,5,13,"And immediately Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea."
41,5,14,"And they that fed the swine fled, and told"
41,5,15,"And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the demon, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid."
41,5,16,"And they that saw"
41,5,17,"And they began to beseech him to depart out of their region."
41,5,18,"And when he had come into the boat, he that had been possessed with the demon begged him that he might be with him."
41,5,19,"However Jesus permitted him not, but saith to him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them what great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee."
41,5,20,"And he departed, and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him: and all"
41,5,21,"And when Jesus had passed over again in a boat to the other side, many people gathered to him: and he was near to the sea."
41,5,22,"And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,"
41,5,23,"And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death:"
41,5,24,"And"
41,5,25,"And a certain woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years,"
41,5,26,"And had suffered many things from many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,"
41,5,27,"When she had heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment."
41,5,28,"For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be made well."
41,5,29,"And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in"
41,5,30,"And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that power had gone out of him, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my clothes?"
41,5,31,"And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?"
41,5,32,"And he looked around to see her that had done this thing."
41,5,33,"But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth."
41,5,34,"And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee well; go in peace, and be healed of thy affliction."
41,5,35,"While he was yet speaking, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s"
41,5,36,"As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe."
41,5,37,"And he permitted no man to follow him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James."
41,5,38,"And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly."
41,5,39,"And when he had come in, he saith to them, Why make ye this tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleepeth."
41,5,40,"And they laughed at him. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the child, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the child was lying."
41,5,41,"And he took the child by the hand, and said to her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Little girl, I say to thee, arise."
41,5,42,"And immediately the child arose, and walked; for she was"
41,5,43,"And he charged them strictly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat."
41,6,1,"And he went out from there, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him."
41,6,2,"And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing"
41,6,3,"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him."
41,6,4,"But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kindred, and in his own house."
41,6,5,"And he could there do no mighty work, except that he laid his hands upon a few sick people, and healed"
41,6,6,"And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went around the villages, teaching."
41,6,7,"And he calleth"
41,6,8,"And commanded them that they should take nothing for"
41,6,9,"But"
41,6,10,"And he said to them, In whatever place ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place."
41,6,11,"And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city."
41,6,12,"And they went out, and preached that men should repent."
41,6,13,"And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed"
41,6,14,"And king Herod heard"
41,6,15,"Others said, That it is Elijah. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets."
41,6,16,"But when Herod heard"
41,6,17,"For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had married her."
41,6,18,"For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife."
41,6,19,"Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:"
41,6,20,"For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly."
41,6,21,"And when a convenient day had come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief"
41,6,22,"And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said to the girl, Ask of me whatever thou wilt, and I will give"
41,6,23,"And he swore to her, Whatever thou shalt ask of me, I will give"
41,6,24,"And she went forth, and said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist."
41,6,25,"And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou shouldest give me immediately on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
41,6,26,"And the king was exceeding sorry;"
41,6,27,"And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,"
41,6,28,"And brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl: and the girl gave it to her mother."
41,6,29,"And when his disciples heard"
41,6,30,"And the apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught."
41,6,31,"And he said to them, Come ye yourselves aside into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat."
41,6,32,"And they departed into a desert place in a boat by themselves."
41,6,33,"And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran on foot there out of all cities, and went before them, and came together to him."
41,6,34,"And Jesus, when he came out, saw many people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things."
41,6,35,"And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, and sayd, This is a desert place, and now the time"
41,6,36,"Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat."
41,6,37,"He answered and said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?"
41,6,38,"He saith to them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes."
41,6,39,"And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass."
41,6,40,"And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties."
41,6,41,"And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave"
41,6,42,"And they all ate, and were satisfied."
41,6,43,"And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes."
41,6,44,"And they that ate of the loaves were about five thousand men."
41,6,45,"And immediately he constrained his disciples to get into the boat, and to go to the other side before to Bethsaida, while he sent away the people."
41,6,46,"And when he had dismissed them, he departed to a mountain to pray."
41,6,47,"And when evening was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land."
41,6,48,"And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary to them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh to them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them."
41,6,49,"But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:"
41,6,50,"For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith to them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid."
41,6,51,"And he went up to them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered."
41,6,52,"For they considered not"
41,6,53,"And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore."
41,6,54,"And when they had come out of the boat, immediately they knew him,"
41,6,55,"And ran through that whole surrounding region, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was."
41,6,56,"And wherever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made well."
41,7,1,"Then came together to him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who came from Jerusalem."
41,7,2,"And when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashed, hands, they found fault."
41,7,3,"For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash"
41,7,4,"And"
41,7,5,"Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?"
41,7,6,"He answered and said to them, Well hath Isaiah prophesied concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with"
41,7,7,"But in vain do they worship me, teaching"
41,7,8,"For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men,"
41,7,9,"And he said to them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition."
41,7,10,"For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoever curseth father or mother, let him die the death:"
41,7,11,"But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother,"
41,7,12,"And ye permit him no more to do any thing for his father or his mother;"
41,7,13,"Making the word of God of no effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do."
41,7,14,"And when he had called all the people"
41,7,15,"There is nothing from outside of a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man."
41,7,16,"If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear."
41,7,17,"And when he had entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable."
41,7,18,"And he saith to them, Are ye so void of understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatever thing from outside entereth into the man,"
41,7,19,"Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the stomach, and goeth out into the draught, purging all foods?"
41,7,20,"And he sayd, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man."
41,7,21,"For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,"
41,7,22,"Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:"
41,7,23,"All these evil things come from within, and defile the man."
41,7,24,"And from there he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know"
41,7,25,"For a"
41,7,26,"The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter."
41,7,27,"But Jesus said to her, Let the children first be satisfied: for it is not good to take the children’s bread, and to cast"
41,7,28,"And she answered and said to him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs."
41,7,29,"And he said to her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter."
41,7,30,"And when she had come to her house, she found the demon had gone out, and her daughter lying upon the bed."
41,7,31,"And again, departing from the region of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the region of Decapolis."
41,7,32,"And they bring to him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him."
41,7,33,"And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;"
41,7,34,"And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened."
41,7,35,"And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain."
41,7,36,"And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they proclaimed"
41,7,37,"And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak."
41,8,1,"In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples, and saith to them,"
41,8,2,"I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:"
41,8,3,"And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for some of them came from far."
41,8,4,"And his disciples answered him, From where can a man satisfy these"
41,8,5,"And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven."
41,8,6,"And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave to his disciples to set before"
41,8,7,"And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before"
41,8,8,"So they ate, and were satisfied: and they took up of the fragments"
41,8,9,"And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away."
41,8,10,"And immediately he entered into a boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha."
41,8,11,"And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, tempting him."
41,8,12,"And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek for a sign? verily I say to you, There shall no sign be given to this generation."
41,8,13,"And he left them, and entering into the boat again departed to the other side."
41,8,14,"Now"
41,8,15,"And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and"
41,8,16,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying,"
41,8,17,"And when Jesus knew"
41,8,18,"Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?"
41,8,19,"When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve."
41,8,20,"And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven."
41,8,21,"And he said to them, How is it that ye do not understand?"
41,8,22,"And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man to him, and besought him to touch him."
41,8,23,"And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw any thing."
41,8,24,"And he looked up, and sayd, I see men as trees, walking."
41,8,25,"After that he put"
41,8,26,"And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell"
41,8,27,"And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?"
41,8,28,"And they answered, John the Baptist: but some"
41,8,29,"And he saith to them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith to him, Thou art the Christ."
41,8,30,"And he charged them that they should tell no man of him."
41,8,31,"And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again."
41,8,32,"And he spoke that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him."
41,8,33,"But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men."
41,8,34,"And when he had called the people"
41,8,35,"For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it."
41,8,36,"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
41,8,37,"Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"
41,8,38,"Whoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
41,9,1,"And he said to them, Verily I say to you, That there are some of them that stand here, who shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power."
41,9,2,"And after six days Jesus taketh"
41,9,3,"And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can make them white."
41,9,4,"And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus."
41,9,5,"And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
41,9,6,"For he knew not what to say; for they were greatly afraid."
41,9,7,"And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him."
41,9,8,"And suddenly, when they had looked around, they saw no man any more, except Jesus only with themselves."
41,9,9,"And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead."
41,9,10,"And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean."
41,9,11,"And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elijah must first come?"
41,9,12,"And he answered and told them, Elijah verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written concerning the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be treated with contempt."
41,9,13,"But I say to you, That Elijah is indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they wished, as it is written concerning him."
41,9,14,"And when he came to"
41,9,15,"And immediately all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to"
41,9,16,"And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?"
41,9,17,"And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought to thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit;"
41,9,18,"And wherever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spoke to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not."
41,9,19,"He answered him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me."
41,9,20,"And they brought him to him: and when he saw him, immediately the spirit tore him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming."
41,9,21,"And he asked his father, How long is it since this came to him? And he said, From a child."
41,9,22,"And often it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us."
41,9,23,"Jesus said to him, If thou canst believe, all things"
41,9,24,"And immediately the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou my unbelief."
41,9,25,"When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying to him,"
41,9,26,"And"
41,9,27,"But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose."
41,9,28,"And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?"
41,9,29,"And he said to them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting."
41,9,30,"And they departed from there, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know"
41,9,31,"For he taught his disciples, and said to them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day."
41,9,32,"But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him."
41,9,33,"And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?"
41,9,34,"But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who"
41,9,35,"And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith to them, If any man desireth to be first,"
41,9,36,"And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said to them,"
41,9,37,"Whoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me."
41,9,38,"And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us."
41,9,39,"But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man who shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me."
41,9,40,"For he that is not against us is for us."
41,9,41,"For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward."
41,9,42,"And whoever shall cause one of"
41,9,43,"And if thy hand causeth thee to stumble, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:"
41,9,44,"Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
41,9,45,"And if thy foot causeth thee to stumble, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter lame into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:"
41,9,46,"Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
41,9,47,"And if thy eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:"
41,9,48,"Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
41,9,49,"For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt."
41,9,50,"Salt"
41,10,1,"And he arose from there, and cometh into the region of Judaea by the other side of Jordan: and the people resort to him again; and, as he was accustomed, he taught them again."
41,10,2,"And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away"
41,10,3,"And he answered and said to them, What did Moses command you?"
41,10,4,"And they said, Moses permitted to write a bill of divorcement, and to put"
41,10,5,"And Jesus answered and said to them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept."
41,10,6,"But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female."
41,10,7,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;"
41,10,8,"And they two shall be one flesh: so then they are no more two, but one flesh."
41,10,9,"What therefore God hath joined together, let not man separate."
41,10,10,"And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same"
41,10,11,"And he saith to them, Whoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her."
41,10,12,"And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery."
41,10,13,"And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and"
41,10,14,"But when Jesus saw"
41,10,15,"Verily I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter it."
41,10,16,"And he took them up in his arms, put"
41,10,17,"And when he had gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
41,10,18,"And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good?"
41,10,19,"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother."
41,10,20,"And he answered and said to him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth."
41,10,21,"Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said to him, One thing thou lackest: go, sell whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me."
41,10,22,"And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions."
41,10,23,"And Jesus looked around, and saith to his disciples, How hard it shall be for them that have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!"
41,10,24,"And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith to them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!"
41,10,25,"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
41,10,26,"And they were astonished beyond measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?"
41,10,27,"And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men"
41,10,28,"Then Peter began to say to him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee."
41,10,29,"Jesus answered and said, Verily I say to you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,"
41,10,30,"But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life."
41,10,31,"But many"
41,10,32,"And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen to him,"
41,10,33,""
41,10,34,"And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again."
41,10,35,"And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatever we shall desire."
41,10,36,"And he said to them, What would ye that I should do for you?"
41,10,37,"They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory."
41,10,38,"But Jesus said to them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"
41,10,39,"And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized with shall ye be baptized:"
41,10,40,"But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but"
41,10,41,"And when the ten heard"
41,10,42,"But Jesus called them, and saith to them, Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them."
41,10,43,"But so it shall not be among you: but whoever would be great among you, shall be your minister:"
41,10,44,"And whoever of you would be the chief, shall be servant of all."
41,10,45,"For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."
41,10,46,"And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the way side begging."
41,10,47,"And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus,"
41,10,48,"And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal,"
41,10,49,"And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee."
41,10,50,"And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus."
41,10,51,"And Jesus answered and said to him, What wilt thou that I should do to thee? The blind man said to him, Lord, that I may receive my sight."
41,10,52,"And Jesus said to him, Go; thy faith hath made thee well. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way."
41,11,1,"And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,"
41,11,2,"And saith to them, Go into the village opposite you: and as soon as ye have entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, on which never man sat; loose him, and bring"
41,11,3,"And if any man shall say to you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and immediately he will send him here."
41,11,4,"And they went away, and found the colt tied by the door outside in a place where two ways met; and they loose him."
41,11,5,"And certain of them that stood there said to them, What do ye, loosing the colt?"
41,11,6,"And they said to them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go."
41,11,7,"And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him."
41,11,8,"And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off trees, and spread"
41,11,9,"And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed"
41,11,10,"Blessed"
41,11,11,"And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked around upon all things, it being now evening had come, he went out to Bethany with the twelve."
41,11,12,"And on the next day, when they had come from Bethany, he was hungry:"
41,11,13,"And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if perhaps he might find any thing on it: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs had not"
41,11,14,"And Jesus answered and said to it, Let no man eat fruit of thee after this for ever. And his disciples heard"
41,11,15,"And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;"
41,11,16,"And would not allow that any man should carry"
41,11,17,"And he taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called by all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves."
41,11,18,"And the scribes and chief priests heard"
41,11,19,"And when evening had come, he went out of the city."
41,11,20,"And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots."
41,11,21,"And Peter calling to remembrance saith to him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou didst curse is withered away."
41,11,22,"And Jesus answering saith to them, Have faith in God."
41,11,23,"For verily I say to you, That whoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that the things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatever he saith."
41,11,24,"Therefore I say to you, Whatever things ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive"
41,11,25,"And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have any thing against any: that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."
41,11,26,"But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses."
41,11,27,"And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,"
41,11,28,"And say to him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?"
41,11,29,"And Jesus answered and said to them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
41,11,30,"The baptism of John, was"
41,11,31,"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?"
41,11,32,"But if we shall say, From men; they feared the people: for all"
41,11,33,"And they answered and said to Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things."
41,12,1,"And he began to speak to them by parables. A"
41,12,2,"And at the season he sent to the vinedressers a servant, that he might receive from the vinedressers of the fruit of the vineyard."
41,12,3,"And they caught"
41,12,4,"And again he sent to them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded"
41,12,5,"And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some."
41,12,6,"Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last to them, saying, They will reverence my son."
41,12,7,"But those vinedressers said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours."
41,12,8,"And they took him, and killed"
41,12,9,"What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the vinedressers, and will give the vineyard to others."
41,12,10,"And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:"
41,12,11,"This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?"
41,12,12,"And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went away."
41,12,13,"And they sent to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in"
41,12,14,"And when they had come, they say to him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?"
41,12,15,"Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see"
41,12,16,"And they brought"
41,12,17,"And Jesus answering said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him."
41,12,18,"Then come to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,"
41,12,19,"Master, Moses wrote to us, If a man’s brother shall die, and leave"
41,12,20,"Now there were seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed."
41,12,21,"And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise."
41,12,22,"And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also."
41,12,23,"In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her for a wife."
41,12,24,"And Jesus answering said to them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?"
41,12,25,"For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels who are in heaven."
41,12,26,"And concerning the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying, I"
41,12,27,"He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err."
41,12,28,"And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?"
41,12,29,"And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments"
41,12,30,"And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this"
41,12,31,"And the second"
41,12,32,"And the scribe said to him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is no other but he:"
41,12,33,"And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love"
41,12,34,"And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that dared ask him"
41,12,35,"And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?"
41,12,36,"For David himself said by the Holy Spirit, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool."
41,12,37,"David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and how is he"
41,12,38,"And he said to them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, who love to go in long clothing, and"
41,12,39,"And the best seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost places at feasts:"
41,12,40,"Who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater condemnation."
41,12,41,"And Jesus sat opposite the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much."
41,12,42,"And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing."
41,12,43,"And he called his disciples, and saith to them, Verily I say to you, That this poor widow hath cast in more than all they who have cast into the treasury:"
41,12,44,"For all"
41,13,1,"And as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples saith to him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings"
41,13,2,"And Jesus answering said to him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
41,13,3,"And as he sat upon the mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,"
41,13,4,"Tell us, when shall these things be? and what"
41,13,5,"And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any"
41,13,6,"For many shall come in my name, saying, I am"
41,13,7,"And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for"
41,13,8,"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in various places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these"
41,13,9,"But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them."
41,13,10,"And the gospel must first be proclaimed among all nations."
41,13,11,"But when they shall lead"
41,13,12,"Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against"
41,13,13,"And ye shall be hated by all"
41,13,14,"But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that are in Judaea flee to the mountains:"
41,13,15,"And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter"
41,13,16,"And let him that is in the field not turn back again to take up his garment."
41,13,17,"But woe to them that are with child, and to them that nurse infants in those days!"
41,13,18,"And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter."
41,13,19,"For"
41,13,20,"And except the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days."
41,13,21,"And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here"
41,13,22,"For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if"
41,13,23,"But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things."
41,13,24,"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,"
41,13,25,"And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken."
41,13,26,"And then they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory."
41,13,27,"And then he shall send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven."
41,13,28,"Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When its branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:"
41,13,29,"So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is near,"
41,13,30,"Verily I say to you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things shall be done."
41,13,31,"Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away."
41,13,32,"But of that day and"
41,13,33,"Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is."
41,13,34,""
41,13,35,"Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at evening, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:"
41,13,36,"Lest coming suddenly he should find you sleeping."
41,13,37,"And what I say to you I say to all, Watch."
41,14,1,"After two days was"
41,14,2,"But they said, Not on the feast"
41,14,3,"And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat eating, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she broke the box, and poured"
41,14,4,"And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?"
41,14,5,"For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her."
41,14,6,"And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me."
41,14,7,"For ye have the poor with you always, and whenever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always."
41,14,8,"She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body for the burial."
41,14,9,"Verily I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world,"
41,14,10,"And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them."
41,14,11,"And when they heard"
41,14,12,"And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said to him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?"
41,14,13,"And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him."
41,14,14,"And wherever he shall go in, say ye to the master of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples?"
41,14,15,"And he will show you a large upper room furnished"
41,14,16,"And his disciples went, and came into the city, and found as he had said to them: and they made ready the passover."
41,14,17,"And in the evening he cometh with the twelve."
41,14,18,"And as they sat and were eating, Jesus said, Verily I say to you, One of you who eateth with me shall betray me."
41,14,19,"And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one,"
41,14,20,"And he answered and said to them,"
41,14,21,"The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written concerning him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born."
41,14,22,"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke"
41,14,23,"And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave"
41,14,24,"And he said to them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many."
41,14,25,"Verily I say to you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
41,14,26,"And when they had sung an hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives."
41,14,27,"And Jesus saith to them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered."
41,14,28,"But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee."
41,14,29,"But Peter said to him, Although all shall be offended, yet"
41,14,30,"And Jesus saith to him, Verily I say to thee, That this day,"
41,14,31,"But he spoke the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any way. Likewise also said they all."
41,14,32,"And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray."
41,14,33,"And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly amazed, and to be very heavy;"
41,14,34,"And saith to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful to death: tarry ye here, and watch."
41,14,35,"And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him."
41,14,36,"And he said, Abba, Father, all things"
41,14,37,"And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?"
41,14,38,"Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly"
41,14,39,"And again he went away, and prayed, and spoke the same words."
41,14,40,"And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither knew they what to answer him."
41,14,41,"And he cometh the third time, and saith to them, Sleep on now, and take"
41,14,42,"Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand."
41,14,43,"And immediately, while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staffs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders."
41,14,44,"And he that betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead"
41,14,45,"And as soon as he was come, he goeth immediately to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him."
41,14,46,"And they laid their hands on him, and took him."
41,14,47,"And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear."
41,14,48,"And Jesus answered and said to them, Have ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and"
41,14,49,"I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled."
41,14,50,"And they all forsook him, and fled."
41,14,51,"And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about"
41,14,52,"And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked."
41,14,53,"And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes."
41,14,54,"And Peter followed him afar off, even into the courtyard of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire."
41,14,55,"And the chief priests and all the council sought for testimony against Jesus to put him to death; and found none."
41,14,56,"For many bore false testimony against him, but their testimony agreed not together."
41,14,57,"And there arose certain, and bore false testimony against him, saying,"
41,14,58,"We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands."
41,14,59,"But neither so did their testimony agree together."
41,14,60,"And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what"
41,14,61,"But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
41,14,62,"And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."
41,14,63,"Then the high priest tore his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?"
41,14,64,"Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death."
41,14,65,"And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the soldiers struck him with the palms of their hands."
41,14,66,"And as Peter was down in the courtyard, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:"
41,14,67,"And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth."
41,14,68,"But he denied, saying, I know not, neither do I understand what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crowed."
41,14,69,"And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is"
41,14,70,"And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art"
41,14,71,"But he began to curse and to swear,"
41,14,72,"And the second time the cock crowed. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said to him, Before the cock shall crow twice, thou shalt deny me three times. And when he thought about it, he wept."
41,15,1,"And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried"
41,15,2,"And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said to him, Thou sayest"
41,15,3,"And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing."
41,15,4,"And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they testify against thee."
41,15,5,"But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled."
41,15,6,"Now at"
41,15,7,"And there was"
41,15,8,"And the multitude crying aloud began to desire"
41,15,9,"But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release to you the King of the Jews?"
41,15,10,"For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy."
41,15,11,"But the chief priests stirred up the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them."
41,15,12,"And Pilate answered and said again to them, What will ye then that I shall do"
41,15,13,"And they cried out again, Crucify him."
41,15,14,"Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him."
41,15,15,"And"
41,15,16,"And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band."
41,15,17,"And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his"
41,15,18,"And began to greet him, Hail, King of the Jews!"
41,15,19,"And they struck him on the head with a reed, and spit upon him, and bowing"
41,15,20,"And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him."
41,15,21,"And they compelled one Simon a Cyrenian, who was passing by, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross."
41,15,22,"And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull."
41,15,23,"And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received"
41,15,24,"And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take."
41,15,25,"And it was the third hour, and they crucified him."
41,15,26,"And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
41,15,27,"And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left."
41,15,28,"And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors."
41,15,29,"And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest"
41,15,30,"Save thyself, and come down from the cross."
41,15,31,"Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save."
41,15,32,"Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him."
41,15,33,"And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."
41,15,34,"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
41,15,35,"And some of them that stood by, when they heard"
41,15,36,"And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put"
41,15,37,"And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost."
41,15,38,"And the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom."
41,15,39,"And when the centurion, who stood in front of him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God."
41,15,40,"There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;"
41,15,41,"(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him;) and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem."
41,15,42,"And now when the evening was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,"
41,15,43,"Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus."
41,15,44,"And Pilate wondered if he was already dead: and calling the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead."
41,15,45,"And when he knew"
41,15,46,"And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre."
41,15,47,"And Mary Magdalene and Mary"
41,16,1,"And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the"
41,16,2,"And very early in the morning the first"
41,16,3,"And they said among themselves, Who shall roll away for us the stone from the door of the sepulchre?"
41,16,4,"And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great."
41,16,5,"And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were amazed."
41,16,6,"And he saith to them, Be not amazed: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him."
41,16,7,"But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said to you."
41,16,8,"And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any"
41,16,9,"Now when"
41,16,10,""
41,16,11,"And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, believed not."
41,16,12,"After that he appeared in another form to two of them, as they walked, and went into the country."
41,16,13,"And they went and told"
41,16,14,"Afterward he appeared to the eleven as they sat eating, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them who had seen him after he was risen."
41,16,15,"And he said to them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."
41,16,16,"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."
41,16,17,"And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak in new tongues;"
41,16,18,"They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."
41,16,19,"So then after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God."
41,16,20,"And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with"
42,1,1,"Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,"
42,1,2,"Even as they delivered them to us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;"
42,1,3,"It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,"
42,1,4,"That thou mayest know the certainty of those things, in which thou hast been instructed."
42,1,5,"There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and his wife"
42,1,6,"And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless."
42,1,7,"And they had no child, because Elisabeth was barren, and they both were"
42,1,8,"And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,"
42,1,9,"According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord."
42,1,10,"And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of incense."
42,1,11,"And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense."
42,1,12,"And when Zacharias saw"
42,1,13,"But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John."
42,1,14,"And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth."
42,1,15,"For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb."
42,1,16,"And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God."
42,1,17,"And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
42,1,18,"And Zacharias said to the angel, How shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well advanced in years."
42,1,19,"And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak to thee, and to show thee these glad tidings."
42,1,20,"And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season."
42,1,21,"And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple."
42,1,22,"And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he made signs to them, and remained speechless."
42,1,23,"And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house."
42,1,24,"And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,"
42,1,25,"Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days when he looked on"
42,1,26,"And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,"
42,1,27,"To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name"
42,1,28,"And the angel came to her, and said, Hail,"
42,1,29,"And when she saw"
42,1,30,"And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God."
42,1,31,"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS."
42,1,32,"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:"
42,1,33,"And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end."
42,1,34,"Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"
42,1,35,"And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing who shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."
42,1,36,"And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren."
42,1,37,"For with God nothing shall be impossible."
42,1,38,"And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her."
42,1,39,"And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah;"
42,1,40,"And entered into the house of Zacharias, and greeted Elisabeth."
42,1,41,"And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit:"
42,1,42,"And she spoke with a loud voice, and said, Blessed"
42,1,43,"And why"
42,1,44,"For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy."
42,1,45,"And blessed"
42,1,46,"And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,"
42,1,47,"And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour."
42,1,48,"For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed."
42,1,49,"For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy"
42,1,50,"And his mercy"
42,1,51,"He hath shown strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts."
42,1,52,"He hath put down the mighty from"
42,1,53,"He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent away empty."
42,1,54,"He hath helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of"
42,1,55,"As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever."
42,1,56,"And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house."
42,1,57,"Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son."
42,1,58,"And her neighbours and her cousins heard that the Lord had shown great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her."
42,1,59,"And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father."
42,1,60,"And his mother answered and said, Not"
42,1,61,"And they said to her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name."
42,1,62,"And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called."
42,1,63,"And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marvelled."
42,1,64,"And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue"
42,1,65,"And fear came on all that dwelt around them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea."
42,1,66,"And all they that had heard"
42,1,67,"And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,"
42,1,68,"Blessed"
42,1,69,"And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;"
42,1,70,"As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began:"
42,1,71,"That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;"
42,1,72,"To perform the mercy"
42,1,73,"The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,"
42,1,74,"That he would grant to us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,"
42,1,75,"In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life."
42,1,76,"And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;"
42,1,77,"To give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,"
42,1,78,"Through the tender mercy of our God; with which the dayspring from on high hath visited us,"
42,1,79,"To give light to them that sit in darkness and"
42,1,80,"And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing to Israel."
42,2,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed."
42,2,2,"("
42,2,3,"And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city."
42,2,4,"And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)"
42,2,5,"To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child."
42,2,6,"And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered."
42,2,7,"And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."
42,2,8,"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night."
42,2,9,"And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them: and they were in great fear."
42,2,10,"And the angel said to them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."
42,2,11,"For to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord."
42,2,12,"And this"
42,2,13,"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,"
42,2,14,"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."
42,2,15,"And it came to pass, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even to Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us."
42,2,16,"And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger."
42,2,17,"And when they had seen"
42,2,18,"And all they that heard"
42,2,19,"But Mary kept all these things, and pondered"
42,2,20,"And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told to them."
42,2,21,"And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, who was so named by the angel before he was conceived in the womb."
42,2,22,"And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present"
42,2,23,"(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)"
42,2,24,"And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons."
42,2,25,"And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name"
42,2,26,"And it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ."
42,2,27,"And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,"
42,2,28,"Then he took him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,"
42,2,29,"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:"
42,2,30,"For my eyes have seen thy salvation,"
42,2,31,"Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;"
42,2,32,"A light to enlighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel."
42,2,33,"And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken concerning him."
42,2,34,"And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this"
42,2,35,"(And, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."
42,2,36,"And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;"
42,2,37,"And she"
42,2,38,"And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem."
42,2,39,"And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth."
42,2,40,"And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him."
42,2,41,"Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover."
42,2,42,"And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast."
42,2,43,"And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not"
42,2,44,"But they, supposing him to be in the company, went a day’s journey; and they sought him among"
42,2,45,"And when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him."
42,2,46,"And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions."
42,2,47,"And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers."
42,2,48,"And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said to him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing."
42,2,49,"And he said to them, How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?"
42,2,50,"And they understood not the saying which he spoke to them."
42,2,51,"And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart."
42,2,52,"And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man."
42,3,1,"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,"
42,3,2,"Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness."
42,3,3,"And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;"
42,3,4,"As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
42,3,5,"Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways"
42,3,6,"And all flesh shall see the salvation of God."
42,3,7,"Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized by him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
42,3,8,"Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for"
42,3,9,"And now also the axe is laid to the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
42,3,10,"And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?"
42,3,11,"He answereth and saith to them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath food, let him do likewise."
42,3,12,"Then came also tax collectors to be baptized, and said to him, Master, what shall we do?"
42,3,13,"And he said to them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you."
42,3,14,"And the soldiers likewise asked him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse"
42,3,15,"And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts concerning John, whether he was the Christ, or not;"
42,3,16,"John answered, saying to"
42,3,17,"Whose fan"
42,3,18,"And many other things in his exhortation he preached to the people."
42,3,19,"But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him on account of Herodias his brother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,"
42,3,20,"Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison."
42,3,21,"Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,"
42,3,22,"And the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased."
42,3,23,"And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, who was"
42,3,24,"Who was"
42,3,25,"Who was"
42,3,26,"Who was"
42,3,27,"Who was"
42,3,28,"Who was"

42,3,38,"Who was"
42,4,1,"And Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,"
42,4,2,"Being forty days tempted by the devil. And in those days he ate nothing: and when they were ended, he was afterward hungry."
42,4,3,"And the devil said to him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread."
42,4,4,"And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God."
42,4,5,"And the devil, taking him up upon an high mountain, showed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time."
42,4,6,"And the devil said to him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered to me; and to whomever I will I give it."
42,4,7,"If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine."
42,4,8,"And Jesus answered and said to him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."
42,4,9,"And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from here:"
42,4,10,"For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:"
42,4,11,"And in"
42,4,12,"And Jesus answering said to him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."
42,4,13,"And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season."
42,4,14,"And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the surrounding region."
42,4,15,"And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all."
42,4,16,"And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath, and stood up to read."
42,4,17,"And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,"
42,4,18,"The Spirit of the Lord"
42,4,19,"To preach the acceptable year of the Lord."
42,4,20,"And he closed the book, and he gave"
42,4,21,"And he began to say to them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
42,4,22,"And all bore him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?"
42,4,23,"And he said to them, Ye will surely say to me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country."
42,4,24,"And he said, Verily I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his own country."
42,4,25,"But I tell you in truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;"
42,4,26,"But to none of them was Elijah sent, except to Zarephath,"
42,4,27,"And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian."
42,4,28,"And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,"
42,4,29,"And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong."
42,4,30,"But he passing through the midst of them went his way,"
42,4,31,"And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days."
42,4,32,"And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power."
42,4,33,"And in the synagogue there was a man, who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,"
42,4,34,"Saying, Let"
42,4,35,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not."
42,4,36,"And they were all amazed, and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word"
42,4,37,"And the fame of him went out into every place in the surrounding country."
42,4,38,"And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. And the mother of Simon’s wife was sick with a high fever; and they besought him for her."
42,4,39,"And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered to them."
42,4,40,"Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them."
42,4,41,"And demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking"
42,4,42,"And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came to him, and would have restrained him, that he should not depart from them."
42,4,43,"And he said to them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent."
42,4,44,"And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee."
42,5,1,"And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,"
42,5,2,"And saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing"
42,5,3,"And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the boat."
42,5,4,"Now when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught."
42,5,5,"And Simon answering said to him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net."
42,5,6,"And when they had done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net broke."
42,5,7,"And they beckoned to"
42,5,8,"When Simon Peter saw"
42,5,9,"For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:"
42,5,10,"And so"
42,5,11,"And when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all, and followed him."
42,5,12,"And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on"
42,5,13,"And he put forth"
42,5,14,"And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
42,5,15,"But so much the more a fame of him went abroad: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities."
42,5,16,"And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed."
42,5,17,"And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was"
42,5,18,"And, behold, men brought in a bed a man who was sick with the palsy: and they sought"
42,5,19,"And when they could not find by what"
42,5,20,"And when he saw their faith, he said to him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee."
42,5,21,"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"
42,5,22,"But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said to them, Why reason ye in your hearts?"
42,5,23,"Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Rise and walk?"
42,5,24,"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority upon earth to forgive sins, (he said to the sick with the palsy,) I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thy house."
42,5,25,"And immediately he arose before them, and took up what he had been laying on, and departed to his own house, glorifying God."
42,5,26,"And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day."
42,5,27,"And after these things he went forth, and saw a tax collector, named Levi, sitting at the tax office: and he said to him, Follow me."
42,5,28,"And he left all, rose up, and followed him."
42,5,29,"And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of tax collectors and of others that sat down with them."
42,5,30,"But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
42,5,31,"And Jesus answering said to them, They that are well need not a physician; but they that are sick."
42,5,32,"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
42,5,33,"And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise"
42,5,34,"And he said to them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?"
42,5,35,"But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days."
42,5,36,"And he spoke also a parable to them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if so, then both the new maketh a tear, and the piece that was"
42,5,37,"And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish."
42,5,38,"But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved."
42,5,39,"No man also having drunk old"
42,6,1,"And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through grain fields; and his disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing"
42,6,2,"And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?"
42,6,3,"And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was hungry, and they who were with him;"
42,6,4,"How he went into the house of God, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?"
42,6,5,"And he said to them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath."
42,6,6,"And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered."
42,6,7,"And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find an accusation against him."
42,6,8,"But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, Arise, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth."
42,6,9,"Then said Jesus to them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy"
42,6,10,"And looking around upon them all, he said to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored well as the other."
42,6,11,"And they were filled with rage; and conferred one with another what they might do to Jesus."
42,6,12,"And it came to pass in those days, that he went out to a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God."
42,6,13,"And when it was day, he called"
42,6,14,"Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,"
42,6,15,"Matthew and Thomas, James the"
42,6,16,"And Judas"
42,6,17,"And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;"
42,6,18,"And they that were tormented with unclean spirits: and they were healed."
42,6,19,"And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went power out of him, and healed"
42,6,20,"And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed"
42,6,21,"Blessed"
42,6,22,"Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you"
42,6,23,"Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward"
42,6,24,"But woe to you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation."
42,6,25,"Woe to you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe to you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep."
42,6,26,"Woe to you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets."
42,6,27,"But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to them who hate you,"
42,6,28,"Bless them that curse you, and pray for them who despitefully use you."
42,6,29,"And to him that smiteth thee on the"
42,6,30,"Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask"
42,6,31,"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise."
42,6,32,"For if ye love them who love you, what thanks have ye? for sinners also love those that love them."
42,6,33,"And if ye do good to them who do good to you, what thanks have ye? for sinners also do even the same."
42,6,34,"And if ye lend"
42,6,35,"But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind to the unthankful and"
42,6,36,"Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful."
42,6,37,"Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:"
42,6,38,"Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye measure it shall be measured to you again."
42,6,39,"And he spoke a parable to them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?"
42,6,40,"The disciple is not above his teacher: but every one that is perfect shall be as his teacher."
42,6,41,"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thy own eye?"
42,6,42,"Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thy eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thy own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thy own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye."
42,6,43,"For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit."
42,6,44,"For every tree is known by its own fruit. For from thorns men do not gather figs, nor from a bramble bush do they gather grapes."
42,6,45,"A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for from the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh."
42,6,46,"And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?"
42,6,47,"Whoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like:"
42,6,48,"He is like a man who built an house, and dug deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock."
42,6,49,"But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house on the earth; against which the stream beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great."
42,7,1,"Now when he had ended all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum."
42,7,2,"And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and ready to die."
42,7,3,"And when he heard of Jesus, he sent to him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant."
42,7,4,"And when they came to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:"
42,7,5,"For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue."
42,7,6,"Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:"
42,7,7,"Therefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed."
42,7,8,"For I also am a man placed under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth"
42,7,9,"When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned himself about, and said to the people that followed him, I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."
42,7,10,"And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well that had been sick."
42,7,11,"And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and many people."
42,7,12,"Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and many people of the city were with her."
42,7,13,"And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, Weep not."
42,7,14,"And he came and touched the bier: and they that bore"
42,7,15,"And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother."
42,7,16,"And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet hath risen among us; and, That God hath visited his people."
42,7,17,"And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the surrounding region."
42,7,18,"And the disciples of John reported to him of all these things."
42,7,19,"And John calling two of his disciples sent"
42,7,20,"When the men had come to him, they said, John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?"
42,7,21,"And in that same hour he cured many of"
42,7,22,"Then Jesus answering said to them, Go, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; that the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached."
42,7,23,"And blessed is"
42,7,24,"And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak to the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?"
42,7,25,"But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they who are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts."
42,7,26,"But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet."
42,7,27,"This is"
42,7,28,"For I say to you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
42,7,29,"And all the people that heard"
42,7,30,"But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized by him."
42,7,31,"And the Lord said, To what then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?"
42,7,32,"They are like children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept."
42,7,33,"For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a demon."
42,7,34,"The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!"
42,7,35,"But wisdom is justified by all her children."
42,7,36,"And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to eat."
42,7,37,"And, behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, when she knew that"
42,7,38,"And stood at his feet behind"
42,7,39,"Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw"
42,7,40,"And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he saith, Master, say it."
42,7,41,"There was a certain creditor who had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty."
42,7,42,"And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?"
42,7,43,"Simon answered and said, I suppose that"
42,7,44,"And he turned to the woman, and said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped"
42,7,45,"Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet."
42,7,46,"My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment."
42,7,47,"Therefore I say to thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,"
42,7,48,"And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven."
42,7,49,"And they that were eating with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?"
42,7,50,"And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace."
42,8,1,"And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve"
42,8,2,"And certain women, who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons,"
42,8,3,"And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to him of their substance."
42,8,4,"And when many people were gathered together, and had come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:"
42,8,5,"A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it."
42,8,6,"And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture."
42,8,7,"And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it."
42,8,8,"And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bore fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
42,8,9,"And his disciples asked him, saying, What doth this parable mean?"
42,8,10,"And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand."
42,8,11,"Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God."
42,8,12,"Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved."
42,8,13,"They on the rock"
42,8,14,"And that which fell among thorns are they, who, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of"
42,8,15,"But that on the good ground are they, who in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep"
42,8,16,"No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth"
42,8,17,"For nothing is secret, that shall not become evident; neither"
42,8,18,"Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whoever hath, to him shall be given; and whoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have."
42,8,19,"Then came to him"
42,8,20,"And it was told to him"
42,8,21,"And he answered and said to them, My mother and my brethren are these who hear the word of God, and do it."
42,8,22,"Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a boat with his disciples: and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth."
42,8,23,"But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled"
42,8,24,"And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm."
42,8,25,"And he said to them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid marvelled, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him."
42,8,26,"And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee."
42,8,27,"And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, who had demons a long time, and wore no clothes, neither abode in"
42,8,28,"When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,"
42,8,29,"(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For often it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he broke the bands, and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.)"
42,8,30,"And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many demons had entered into him."
42,8,31,"And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep."
42,8,32,"And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would allow them to enter into them. And he permitted them."
42,8,33,"Then the demons went out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked."
42,8,34,"When they that fed"
42,8,35,"Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the demons had departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid."
42,8,36,"They also who saw"
42,8,37,"Then the whole multitude of the country of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes besought him to depart from them; for they were seized with great fear: and he went into the boat, and returned back again."
42,8,38,"Now the man out of whom the demons had departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,"
42,8,39,"Return to thy own house, and show what great things God hath done to thee. And he went away, and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done to him."
42,8,40,"And it came to pass, that, when Jesus had returned, the people"
42,8,41,"And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at the feet of Jesus, and besought him that he would come into his house:"
42,8,42,"For he had one daughter only, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as he was going the people thronged him."
42,8,43,"And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed by any,"
42,8,44,"Came behind"
42,8,45,"And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press"
42,8,46,"And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that power hath gone out of me."
42,8,47,"And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared to him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately."
42,8,48,"And he said to her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee well; go in peace."
42,8,49,"While he was yet speaking, there cometh one from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master."
42,8,50,"But when Jesus heard"
42,8,51,"And when he came into the house, he allowed no man to go in, except Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden."
42,8,52,"And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth."
42,8,53,"And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead."
42,8,54,"And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise."
42,8,55,"And her spirit came again, and she arose immediately: and he commanded to give her"
42,8,56,"And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done."
42,9,1,"Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases."
42,9,2,"And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick."
42,9,3,"And he said to them, Take nothing for"
42,9,4,"And whatever house ye enter into, there abide, and from there depart."
42,9,5,"And whoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them."
42,9,6,"And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where."
42,9,7,"Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John had risen from the dead;"
42,9,8,"And by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the ancient prophets had risen again."
42,9,9,"And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him."
42,9,10,"And the apostles, when they had returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida."
42,9,11,"And the people, when they knew"
42,9,12,"And when the day began to decline, then came the twelve, and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding towns and country, and lodge, and get food: for we are here in a deserted place."
42,9,13,"But he said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people."
42,9,14,"For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company."
42,9,15,"And they did so, and made them all sit down."
42,9,16,"Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude."
42,9,17,"And they ate, and were all satisfied: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets."
42,9,18,"And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who say the people that I am?"
42,9,19,"They answering said, John the Baptist; but some"
42,9,20,"He said to them, But who say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God."
42,9,21,"And he strictly charged them, and commanded"
42,9,22,"Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day."
42,9,23,"And he said to"
42,9,24,"For whoever will save his life shall lose it: but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it."
42,9,25,"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?"
42,9,26,"For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and"
42,9,27,"But I tell you truly, there are some standing here, who shall not taste death, till they see the kingdom of God."
42,9,28,"And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up upon a mountain to pray."
42,9,29,"And as he prayed, the appearance of his countenance was altered, and his raiment"
42,9,30,"And, behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah:"
42,9,31,"Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem."
42,9,32,"But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him."
42,9,33,"And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said."
42,9,34,"While he was thus speaking, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud."
42,9,35,"And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him."
42,9,36,"And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept"
42,9,37,"And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, many people met him."
42,9,38,"And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is my only child."
42,9,39,"And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and bruising him hardly departeth from him."
42,9,40,"And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not."
42,9,41,"And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and put up with you? Bring thy son here."
42,9,42,"And as he was yet coming, the demon threw him down, and tore"
42,9,43,"And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they were all amazed at all things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,"
42,9,44,"Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men."
42,9,45,"But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him concerning that saying."
42,9,46,"Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest."
42,9,47,"And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,"
42,9,48,"And said to them, Whoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great."
42,9,49,"And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us."
42,9,50,"And Jesus said to him, Forbid"
42,9,51,"And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,"
42,9,52,"And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him."
42,9,53,"And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem."
42,9,54,"And when his disciples James and John saw"
42,9,55,"But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of."
42,9,56,"For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save"
42,9,57,"And it came to pass, that, as they were going in the way, a certain"
42,9,58,"And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air"
42,9,59,"And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."
42,9,60,"Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God."
42,9,61,"And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go and bid them farewell, who are at my house."
42,9,62,"And Jesus said to him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."
42,10,1,"After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come."
42,10,2,"Therefore said he to them, The harvest truly"
42,10,3,"Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves."
42,10,4,"Carry neither purse, nor sack, nor shoes: and greet no man by the way."
42,10,5,"And into whatever house ye enter, first say, Peace"
42,10,6,"And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again."
42,10,7,"And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house."
42,10,8,"And into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:"
42,10,9,"And heal the sick that are in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God is come near to you."
42,10,10,"But into whatever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets of the same, and say,"
42,10,11,"Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: however be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come near to you."
42,10,12,"But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city."
42,10,13,"Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
42,10,14,"But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you."
42,10,15,"And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shall be thrust down to hell."
42,10,16,"He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me."
42,10,17,"And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us through thy name."
42,10,18,"And he said to them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven."
42,10,19,"Behold, I give to you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you."
42,10,20,"However in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven."
42,10,21,"In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight."
42,10,22,"All things are delivered to me by my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and"
42,10,23,"And he turned himself to"
42,10,24,"For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen"
42,10,25,"And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
42,10,26,"He said to him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?"
42,10,27,"And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself."
42,10,28,"And he said to him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live."
42,10,29,"But he, wishing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbour?"
42,10,30,"And Jesus answering said, A certain"
42,10,31,"And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side."
42,10,32,"And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked"
42,10,33,"But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion"
42,10,34,"And went to"
42,10,35,"And on the next day when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave"
42,10,36,"Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour to him that fell among the thieves?"
42,10,37,"And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus to him, Go, and do thou likewise."
42,10,38,"Now it came to pass, as they were going, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house."
42,10,39,"And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word."
42,10,40,"But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me."
42,10,41,"And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, thou art worried and troubled about many things:"
42,10,42,"But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her."
42,11,1,"And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples."
42,11,2,"And he said to them, When ye pray, say, Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth."
42,11,3,"Give us day by day our daily bread."
42,11,4,"And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil."
42,11,5,"And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;"
42,11,6,"For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?"
42,11,7,"And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee."
42,11,8,"I say to you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth."
42,11,9,"And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you."
42,11,10,"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."
42,11,11,"If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if"
42,11,12,"Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?"
42,11,13,"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more shall"
42,11,14,"And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the dumb spoke; and the people marvelled."
42,11,15,"But some of them said, He casteth out demons through Beelzebub the chief of the demons."
42,11,16,"And others, tempting"
42,11,17,"But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house"
42,11,18,"If Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out demons through Beelzebub."
42,11,19,"And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast"
42,11,20,"But if I with the finger of God cast out demons, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you."
42,11,21,"When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:"
42,11,22,"But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour in which he trusted, and divideth his spoils."
42,11,23,"He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth."
42,11,24,"When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return to my house from which I came out."
42,11,25,"And when he cometh, he findeth"
42,11,26,"Then he goeth, and taketh"

42,11,41,"But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean to you."
42,11,42,"But woe to you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over justice and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the others undone."
42,11,43,"Woe to you, Pharisees! for ye love the best seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets."
42,11,44,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over"
42,11,45,"Then answered one of the lawyers, and said to him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also."
42,11,46,"And he said, Woe to you also,"
42,11,47,"Woe to you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them."
42,11,48,"Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres."
42,11,49,"Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and"
42,11,50,"That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;"
42,11,51,"From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say to you, It shall be required of this generation."
42,11,52,"Woe to you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye have not centered in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered."
42,11,53,"And as he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to oppose"
42,11,54,"Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something from his mouth, that they might accuse him."
42,12,1,"In the mean time, when there was gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, so that they trampled one upon another, he began to say to his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."
42,12,2,"For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known."
42,12,3,"Therefore whatever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops."
42,12,4,"And I say to you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do."
42,12,5,"But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say to you, Fear him."
42,12,6,"Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?"
42,12,7,"But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows."
42,12,8,"Also I say to you, Whoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:"
42,12,9,"But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God."
42,12,10,"And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven."
42,12,11,"And when they bring you to the synagogues, and"
42,12,12,"For the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say."
42,12,13,"And one of the company said to him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me."
42,12,14,"And he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?"
42,12,15,"And he said to them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."
42,12,16,"And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:"
42,12,17,"And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no place where to store my fruits?"
42,12,18,"And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I store all my fruits and my goods."
42,12,19,"And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many goods laid up for many years; take thy ease, eat, drink,"
42,12,20,"But God said to him,"
42,12,21,"So"
42,12,22,"And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on."
42,12,23,"The life is more than food, and the body"
42,12,24,"Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?"
42,12,25,"And which of you by being anxious can add to his stature one cubit?"
42,12,26,"If ye then are not able to do that thing which is least, why are ye anxious for the rest?"
42,12,27,"Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say to you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
42,12,28,"If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more"
42,12,29,"And seek ye not what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind."
42,12,30,"For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things."
42,12,31,"But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added to you."
42,12,32,"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom."
42,12,33,"Sell what ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which become not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth."
42,12,34,"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
42,12,35,"Let your loins be girt, and"
42,12,36,"And ye yourselves like men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him immediately."
42,12,37,"Blessed"
42,12,38,"And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find"
42,12,39,"And this know, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have allowed his house to be broken into."
42,12,40,"Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not."
42,12,41,"Then Peter said to him, Lord, speakest thou this parable to us, or even to all?"
42,12,42,"And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom"
42,12,43,"Blessed"
42,12,44,"Truly I say to you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath."
42,12,45,"But if that servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunk;"
42,12,46,"The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for"
42,12,47,"And that servant, who knew his lord’s will, and prepared not"
42,12,48,"But he that knew not, and committed things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few"
42,12,49,"I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it is already kindled?"
42,12,50,"But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I constrained till it shall be accomplished!"
42,12,51,"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:"
42,12,52,"For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three."
42,12,53,"The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."
42,12,54,"And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rising in the west, immediately ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is."
42,12,55,"And when"
42,12,56,""
42,12,57,"Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?"
42,12,58,"When thou goest with thy adversary to the magistrate,"
42,12,59,"I tell thee, thou shalt not depart from there, till thou hast paid the very last mite."
42,13,1,"There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices."
42,13,2,"And Jesus answering said to them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?"
42,13,3,"I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."
42,13,4,"Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?"
42,13,5,"I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."
42,13,6,"He spoke also this parable; A certain"
42,13,7,"Then said he to the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?"
42,13,8,"And he answering said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung"
42,13,9,"And if it shall bear fruit,"
42,13,10,"And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath."
42,13,11,"And, behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no way raise"
42,13,12,"And when Jesus saw her, he called"
42,13,13,"And he laid"
42,13,14,"And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, and said to the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day."
42,13,15,"The Lord then answered him, and said,"
42,13,16,"And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?"
42,13,17,"And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him."
42,13,18,"Then said he, To what is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I compare it?"
42,13,19,"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and became a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in its branches."
42,13,20,"And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?"
42,13,21,"It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
42,13,22,"And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem."
42,13,23,"Then said one to him, Lord, are there few that are saved? And he said to them,"
42,13,24,"Strive to enter in at the narrow gate: for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able."
42,13,25,"When once the master of the house hath risen up, and hath shut the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not where ye are from:"
42,13,26,"Then ye shall begin to say, We ate and drank in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets."
42,13,27,"But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not where ye are from; depart from me, all"
42,13,28,"There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you"
42,13,29,"And they shall come from the east, and"
42,13,30,"And, behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last."
42,13,31,"The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Go away, and depart from here: for Herod will kill thee."
42,13,32,"And he said to them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third"
42,13,33,"Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the"
42,13,34,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent to thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen"
42,13,35,"Behold, your house is left to you desolate: and verily I say to you, Ye shall not see me, until"
42,14,1,"And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath, that they watched him."
42,14,2,"And, behold, there was a certain man before him who had the dropsy."
42,14,3,"And Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath?"
42,14,4,"And they held their peace. And he took"
42,14,5,"And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have a donkey or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not immediately pull him out on the sabbath day?"
42,14,6,"And they could not answer him again to these things."
42,14,7,"And he put forth a parable to those who were invited, when he marked how they chose out the best places; saying to them,"
42,14,8,"When thou art invited by any"
42,14,9,"And he that invited thee and him shall come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest place."
42,14,10,"But when thou art invited, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he that invited thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have honour in the presence of them that sit eating with thee."
42,14,11,"For whoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
42,14,12,"Then said he also to him that invited him, When thou givest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor"
42,14,13,"But when thou givest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:"
42,14,14,"And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just."
42,14,15,"And when one of them that sat eating with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed"
42,14,16,"Then said he to him, A certain man gave a great supper, and invited many:"
42,14,17,"And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were invited, Come; for all things are now ready."
42,14,18,"And they all with one"
42,14,19,"And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to try them out: I pray thee have me excused."
42,14,20,"And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come."
42,14,21,"So that servant came, and showed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, and the maimed, and the lame, and the blind."
42,14,22,"And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room."
42,14,23,"And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel"
42,14,24,"For I say to you, That none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper."
42,14,25,"And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said to them,"
42,14,26,"If any"
42,14,27,"And whoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple."
42,14,28,"For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he hath"
42,14,29,"Lest perhaps, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish"
42,14,30,"Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish."
42,14,31,"Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?"
42,14,32,"Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth a delegation, and desireth conditions of peace."
42,14,33,"So likewise, whoever he is of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple."
42,14,34,"Salt"
42,14,35,"It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill;"
42,15,1,"Then drew near to him all the tax collectors and sinners to hear him."
42,15,2,"And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them."
42,15,3,"And he spoke this parable to them, saying,"
42,15,4,"What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he loseth one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he findeth it?"
42,15,5,"And when he hath found"
42,15,6,"And when he cometh home, he calleth together"
42,15,7,"I say to you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine righteous persons, who need no repentance."
42,15,8,"Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she loseth one piece, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she findeth"
42,15,9,"And when she hath found"
42,15,10,"Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth."
42,15,11,"And he said, A certain man had two sons:"
42,15,12,"And the younger of them said to"
42,15,13,"And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living."
42,15,14,"And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want."
42,15,15,"And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine."
42,15,16,"And he was longing to fill his belly with the husks that the swine ate: and no man gave to him."
42,15,17,"And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger!"
42,15,18,"I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,"
42,15,19,"And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants."
42,15,20,"And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him."
42,15,21,"And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son."
42,15,22,"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put"
42,15,23,"And bring here the fatted calf, and kill"
42,15,24,"For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry."
42,15,25,"Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing."
42,15,26,"And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant."
42,15,27,"And he said to him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound."
42,15,28,"And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore his father came out, and entreated him."
42,15,29,"And he answering said to"
42,15,30,"But as soon as this thy son had come, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf."
42,15,31,"And he said to him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine."
42,15,32,"It was right that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found."
42,16,1,"And he said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused to him that he had wasted his goods."
42,16,2,"And he called him, and said to him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward."
42,16,3,"Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg."
42,16,4,"I am resolved what to do, that, when I am removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses."
42,16,5,"So he called every one of his lord’s debtors, and said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord?"
42,16,6,"And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty."
42,16,7,"Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, Take thy bill, and write eighty."
42,16,8,"And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light."
42,16,9,"And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends by the riches of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations."
42,16,10,"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much."
42,16,11,"If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous riches, who will commit to your trust the true"
42,16,12,"And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own?"
42,16,13,"No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and riches."
42,16,14,"And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they mocked him."
42,16,15,"And he said to them, Ye are they who justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God."
42,16,16,"The law and the prophets"
42,16,17,"And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than one tittle of the law to fail."
42,16,18,"Whoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whoever marrieth her that is put away from"
42,16,19,"There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:"
42,16,20,"And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores,"
42,16,21,"And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores."
42,16,22,"And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;"
42,16,23,"And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."
42,16,24,"And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame."
42,16,25,"But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime didst receive thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented."
42,16,26,"And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they who would pass from here to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that"
42,16,27,"Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:"
42,16,28,"For I have five brethren; that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment."
42,16,29,"Abraham saith to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."
42,16,30,"And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will repent."
42,16,31,"And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."
42,17,1,"Then he said to the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe"
42,17,2,"It were better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones."
42,17,3,"Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother shall trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he shall repent, forgive him."
42,17,4,"And if he tresspasses against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turns again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him."
42,17,5,"And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith."
42,17,6,"And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say to this mulberry tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you."
42,17,7,"But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say to him immediately, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to eat?"
42,17,8,"And will not rather say to him, Make ready something that I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunk; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?"
42,17,9,"Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not."
42,17,10,"So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do."
42,17,11,"And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee."
42,17,12,"And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off:"
42,17,13,"And they lifted up"
42,17,14,"And when he saw"
42,17,15,"And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,"
42,17,16,"And fell down on"
42,17,17,"And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where"
42,17,18,"There are not found returning to give glory to God, except this stranger."
42,17,19,"And he said to him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee well."
42,17,20,"And when he was asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:"
42,17,21,"Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you."
42,17,22,"And he said to his disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see"
42,17,23,"And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after"
42,17,24,"For as the lightning, that lighteneth from the one"
42,17,25,"But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation."
42,17,26,"And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man."
42,17,27,"They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all."
42,17,28,"Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;"
42,17,29,"But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed"
42,17,30,"Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed."
42,17,31,"In that day, he who shall be upon the housetop, and his furniture in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back."
42,17,32,"Remember Lot’s wife."
42,17,33,"Whoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whoever shall lose his life shall preserve it."
42,17,34,"I tell you, in that night there shall be two"
42,17,35,"Two"
42,17,36,"Two"
42,17,37,"And they answered and said to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Wherever the body"
42,18,1,"And he spoke a parable to them"
42,18,2,"Saying, There was in a city a judge, who feared not God, neither regarded man:"
42,18,3,"And there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary."
42,18,4,"And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;"
42,18,5,"Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me."
42,18,6,"And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith."
42,18,7,"And shall not God avenge his own elect, who cry day and night to him, though he beareth long with them?"
42,18,8,"I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?"
42,18,9,"And he spoke this parable to certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:"
42,18,10,"Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector."
42,18,11,"The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men"
42,18,12,"I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess."
42,18,13,"And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as"
42,18,14,"I tell you, this man went down to his house justified"
42,18,15,"And they brought to him also infants, that he would touch them: but when"
42,18,16,"But Jesus called them"
42,18,17,"Verily I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall by no means enter into it."
42,18,18,"And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
42,18,19,"And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? none"
42,18,20,"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother."
42,18,21,"And he said, All these have I kept from my youth."
42,18,22,"Now when Jesus heard these things, he said to him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me."
42,18,23,"And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich."
42,18,24,"And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hard it is for them that have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!"
42,18,25,"For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
42,18,26,"And they that heard"
42,18,27,"But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."
42,18,28,"Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee."
42,18,29,"And he said to them, Verily I say to you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,"
42,18,30,"Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting."
42,18,31,"Then he took the twelve, and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished."
42,18,32,"For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully treated, and spitted on:"
42,18,33,"And they shall scourge"
42,18,34,"And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken."
42,18,35,"And it came to pass, that as he had come near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:"
42,18,36,"And hearing the multitude passing by, he asked what it meant."
42,18,37,"And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by."
42,18,38,"And he cried, saying, Jesus,"
42,18,39,"And they who went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more,"
42,18,40,"And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought to him: and when he had come near, he asked him,"
42,18,41,"Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight."
42,18,42,"And Jesus said to him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee."
42,18,43,"And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw"
42,19,1,"And"
42,19,2,"And, behold,"
42,19,3,"And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature."
42,19,4,"And he ran before, and climbed up upon a sycamore tree to see him: for he was to pass that"
42,19,5,"And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house."
42,19,6,"And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully."
42,19,7,"And when they saw"
42,19,8,"And Zacchaeus stood, and said to the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore"
42,19,9,"And Jesus said to him, This day is salvation come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham."
42,19,10,"For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost."
42,19,11,"And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear."
42,19,12,"He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return."
42,19,13,"And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said to them, Occupy till I come."
42,19,14,"But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this"
42,19,15,"And it came to pass, that when he had returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading."
42,19,16,"Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds."
42,19,17,"And he said to him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities."
42,19,18,"And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds."
42,19,19,"And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities."
42,19,20,"And another came, saying, Lord, behold,"
42,19,21,"For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and reapest what thou didst not sow."
42,19,22,"And he saith to him, Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee,"
42,19,23,"Why then gavest thou not my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required my own with interest?"
42,19,24,"And he said to them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give"
42,19,25,"(And they said to him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)"
42,19,26,"For I say to you, That to every one who hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even what he hath shall be taken away from him."
42,19,27,"But those my enemies, who would not that I should reign over them, bring here, and slay"
42,19,28,"And when he had thus spoken, he went before, going up to Jerusalem."
42,19,29,"And it came to pass, when he had come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called"
42,19,30,"Saying, Go ye into the village opposite"
42,19,31,"And if any man shall ask you, Why do ye loose"
42,19,32,"And they that were sent went, and found even as he had said to them."
42,19,33,"And as they were loosing the colt, its owners said to them, Why loose ye the colt?"
42,19,34,"And they said, The Lord hath need of him."
42,19,35,"And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus on it."
42,19,36,"And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way."
42,19,37,"And when he had come near, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;"
42,19,38,"Saying, Blessed"
42,19,39,"And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him, Master, rebuke thy disciples."
42,19,40,"And he answered and said to them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out."
42,19,41,"And when he had come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,"
42,19,42,"Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things"
42,19,43,"For the days shall come upon thee, that thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and surround thee, and keep thee in on every side,"
42,19,44,"And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation."
42,19,45,"And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold in it, and them that bought;"
42,19,46,"Saying to them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves."
42,19,47,"And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,"
42,19,48,"And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him."
42,20,1,"And it came to pass,"
42,20,2,"And spoke to him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?"
42,20,3,"And he answered and said to them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:"
42,20,4,"The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?"
42,20,5,"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?"
42,20,6,"But if we say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet."
42,20,7,"And they answered, that they could not tell where"
42,20,8,"And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things."
42,20,9,"Then he began to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it out to vinedressers, and went into a far country for a long time."
42,20,10,"And at the season he sent a servant to the vinedressers, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the vinedressers beat him, and sent"
42,20,11,"And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and treated"
42,20,12,"And again he sent the third: and they wounded him also, and cast"
42,20,13,"Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be when they see him they will reverence"
42,20,14,"But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours."
42,20,15,"So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed"
42,20,16,"He shall come and destroy these vinedressers, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard"
42,20,17,"And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?"
42,20,18,"Whoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."
42,20,19,"And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them."
42,20,20,"And they watched"
42,20,21,"And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person"
42,20,22,"Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?"
42,20,23,"But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, Why tempt ye me?"
42,20,24,"Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar’s."
42,20,25,"And he said to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and to God the things which are God’s."
42,20,26,"And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace."
42,20,27,"Then came to"
42,20,28,"Saying, Master, Moses wrote to us, If any man’s brother should die, having a wife, and he should die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother."
42,20,29,"There were therefore seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and died without children."
42,20,30,"And the second took her for a wife, and he died childless."
42,20,31,"And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died."
42,20,32,"Last of all the woman died also."
42,20,33,"Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her for a wife."
42,20,34,"And Jesus answering said to them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:"
42,20,35,"But they who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:"
42,20,36,"Neither can they die any more: for they are equal to the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection."
42,20,37,"Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."
42,20,38,"For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him."
42,20,39,"Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said."
42,20,40,"And after that they dared not ask him any"
42,20,41,"And he said to them, How say they that Christ is David’s son?"
42,20,42,"And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,"
42,20,43,"Till I make thy enemies thy footstool."
42,20,44,"David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?"
42,20,45,"Then in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,"
42,20,46,"Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;"
42,20,47,"Who devour widows’ houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater condemnation."
42,21,1,"And he looked up, and saw rich men casting their gifts into the treasury."
42,21,2,"And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in there two mites."
42,21,3,"And he said, Truly I say to you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:"
42,21,4,"For all these have of their abundance cast in to the offerings of God: but she of her poverty hath cast in all the living that she had."
42,21,5,"And as some spoke of the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts, he said,"
42,21,6,""
42,21,7,"And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign"
42,21,8,"And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am"
42,21,9,"But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end"
42,21,10,"Then said he to them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:"
42,21,11,"And great earthquakes shall be in various places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven."
42,21,12,"But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute"
42,21,13,"And it shall turn to you for a testimony."
42,21,14,"Settle"
42,21,15,"For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to speak against nor withstand."
42,21,16,"And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsmen, and friends; and"
42,21,17,"And ye shall be hated by all"
42,21,18,"But there shall not an hair of your head perish."
42,21,19,"In your patience possess ye your souls."
42,21,20,"And when ye shall see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that her desolation is near."
42,21,21,"Then let them who are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them who are in the midst of it depart from it; and let not them that are in the countries enter into it."
42,21,22,"For these are the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled."
42,21,23,"But woe to them that are with child, and to them that nurse infants, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people."
42,21,24,"And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled."
42,21,25,"And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;"
42,21,26,"Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for expectation of those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken."
42,21,27,"And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory."
42,21,28,"And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth near."
42,21,29,"And he spoke to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;"
42,21,30,"When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now near at hand."
42,21,31,"So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is near at hand."
42,21,32,"Verily I say to you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled."
42,21,33,"Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away."
42,21,34,"And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with dissipation, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and"
42,21,35,"For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth."
42,21,36,"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man."
42,21,37,"And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called"
42,21,38,"And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him."
42,22,1,"Now the feast of unleavened bread drew near, which is called the Passover."
42,22,2,"And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people."
42,22,3,"Then Satan entered into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve."
42,22,4,"And he went his way, and conferred with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him to them."
42,22,5,"And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money."
42,22,6,"And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude."
42,22,7,"Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed."
42,22,8,"And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare for us the passover, that we may eat."
42,22,9,"And they said to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?"
42,22,10,"And he said to them, Behold, when ye have entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth."
42,22,11,"And ye shall say to the master of the house, The Master saith to thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples?"
42,22,12,"And he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready."
42,22,13,"And they went, and found as he had said to them: and they made ready the passover."
42,22,14,"And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him."
42,22,15,"And he said to them, I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:"
42,22,16,"For I say to you, I will not any more eat of it, until it shall be fulfilled in the kingdom of God."
42,22,17,"And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and share"
42,22,18,"For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come."
42,22,19,"And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke"
42,22,20,"Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup"
42,22,21,"But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me"
42,22,22,"And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!"
42,22,23,"And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing."
42,22,24,"And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest."
42,22,25,"And he said to them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors."
42,22,26,"But ye"
42,22,27,"For who"
42,22,28,"Ye are they who have continued with me in my temptations."
42,22,29,"And I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed to me;"
42,22,30,"That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
42,22,31,"And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired"
42,22,32,"But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren."
42,22,33,"And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death."
42,22,34,"And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before thou shalt three times deny that thou knowest me."
42,22,35,"And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and sack, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing."
42,22,36,"Then said he to them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take"
42,22,37,"For I say to you, that this which is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end."
42,22,38,"And they said, Lord, behold, here"
42,22,39,"And he came out, and went, as he was accustomed, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him."
42,22,40,"And when he was at the place, he said to them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation."
42,22,41,"And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,"
42,22,42,"Saying, Father, if thou art willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done."
42,22,43,"And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him."
42,22,44,"And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground."
42,22,45,"And when he rose up from prayer, and had come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,"
42,22,46,"And said to them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation."
42,22,47,"And while he was yet speaking, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him."
42,22,48,"But Jesus said to him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?"
42,22,49,"When they who were about him saw what would follow, they said to him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?"
42,22,50,"And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear."
42,22,51,"And Jesus answered and said, Permit ye even this. And he touched his ear, and healed him."
42,22,52,"Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, who had come to him, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staffs?"
42,22,53,"When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness."
42,22,54,"Then they took him, and led"
42,22,55,"And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the courtyard, and were seated together, Peter sat down among them."
42,22,56,"But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him."
42,22,57,"And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not."
42,22,58,"And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not."
42,22,59,"And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Surely this"
42,22,60,"And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, the cock crowed."
42,22,61,"And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, Before the cock shall crow, thou wilt deny me three times."
42,22,62,"And Peter went out, and wept bitterly."
42,22,63,"And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote"
42,22,64,"And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?"
42,22,65,"And many other things blasphemously they spoke against him."
42,22,66,"And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,"
42,22,67,"Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:"
42,22,68,"And if I also ask"
42,22,69,"After this shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God."
42,22,70,"Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am."
42,22,71,"And they said, What need have we of any further testimony? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth."
42,23,1,"And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him to Pilate."
42,23,2,"And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this"
42,23,3,"And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest"
42,23,4,"Then said Pilate to the chief priests and"
42,23,5,"And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee to this place."
42,23,6,"When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man was a Galilaean."
42,23,7,"And as soon as he knew that he belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself was also at Jerusalem at that time."
42,23,8,"And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he had been for a long time, desirous to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him."
42,23,9,"Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing."
42,23,10,"And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him."
42,23,11,"And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt, and mocked"
42,23,12,"And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves."
42,23,13,"And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,"
42,23,14,"Said to them, Ye have brought this man to me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined"
42,23,15,"No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done to him."
42,23,16,"I will therefore chastise him, and release"
42,23,17,"(For of necessity he must release one to them at the feast.)"
42,23,18,"And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this"
42,23,19,"(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)"
42,23,20,"Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them."
42,23,21,"But they cried, saying, Crucify"
42,23,22,"And he said to them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let"
42,23,23,"And they were insistent with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed."
42,23,24,"And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required."
42,23,25,"And he released to them him that for sedition and murder had been cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will."
42,23,26,"And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear"
42,23,27,"And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him."
42,23,28,"But Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children."
42,23,29,"For, behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed"
42,23,30,"Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us."
42,23,31,"For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?"
42,23,32,"And two others, who were malefactors, were led with him to be put to death."
42,23,33,"And when they had come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left."
42,23,34,"Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots."
42,23,35,"And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them mocked"
42,23,36,"And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,"
42,23,37,"And saying, If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself."
42,23,38,"And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
42,23,39,"And one of the malefactors who were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou art Christ, save thyself and us."
42,23,40,"But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?"
42,23,41,"And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss."
42,23,42,"And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom."
42,23,43,"And Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, This day shalt thou be with me in paradise."
42,23,44,"And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the land until the ninth hour."
42,23,45,"And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in the midst."
42,23,46,"And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."
42,23,47,"Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man."
42,23,48,"And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned."
42,23,49,"And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things."
42,23,50,"And, behold,"
42,23,51,"(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;)"
42,23,52,"This"
42,23,53,"And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, where man was never before laid."
42,23,54,"And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on."
42,23,55,"And the women also, who came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid."
42,23,56,"And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested on the sabbath according to the commandment."
42,24,1,"Now upon the first"
42,24,2,"And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre."
42,24,3,"And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus."
42,24,4,"And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:"
42,24,5,"And as they were afraid, and bowed down"
42,24,6,"He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee,"
42,24,7,"Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again."
42,24,8,"And they remembered his words,"
42,24,9,"And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest."
42,24,10,"It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary"
42,24,11,"And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not."
42,24,12,"Then Peter arose, and ran to the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which had come to pass."
42,24,13,"And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem"
42,24,14,"And they talked together of all these things which had happened."
42,24,15,"And it came to pass, that, while they communed"
42,24,16,"But their eyes were restrained that they should not know him."
42,24,17,"And he said to them, What manner of communications"
42,24,18,"And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which have come to pass there in these days?"
42,24,19,"And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:"
42,24,20,"And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him."
42,24,21,"But we hoped that it had been he who should have redeemed Israel: and besides all this, to day is the third day since these things were done."
42,24,22,"Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, who were early at the sepulchre;"
42,24,23,"And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive."
42,24,24,"And certain of them who were with us went to the sepulchre, and found"
42,24,25,"Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:"
42,24,26,"Ought not Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?"
42,24,27,"And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself."
42,24,28,"And they drew near to the village, where they were going: and he made as though he would go further."
42,24,29,"But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them."
42,24,30,"And it came to pass, as he sat eating with them, he took bread, and blessed"
42,24,31,"And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight."
42,24,32,"And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?"
42,24,33,"And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,"
42,24,34,"Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon."
42,24,35,"And they told what things"
42,24,36,"And as they were thus speaking, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith to them, Peace"
42,24,37,"But they were terrified and trembled, and supposed that they had seen a spirit."
42,24,38,"And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?"
42,24,39,"Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have."
42,24,40,"And when he had thus spoken, he showed them"
42,24,41,"And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have ye here any thing to eat?"
42,24,42,"And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb."
42,24,43,"And he took"
42,24,44,"And he said to them, These"
42,24,45,"Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,"
42,24,46,"And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:"
42,24,47,"And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."
42,24,48,"And ye are witnesses of these things."
42,24,49,"And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye are endued with power from on high."
42,24,50,"And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them."
42,24,51,"And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven."
42,24,52,"And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:"
42,24,53,"And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen."
43,1,1,"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
43,1,2,"The same was in the beginning with God."
43,1,3,"All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made."
43,1,4,"In him was life; and the life was the light of men."
43,1,5,"And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not."
43,1,6,"There was a man sent from God, whose name"
43,1,7,"The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all"
43,1,8,"He was not that Light, but"
43,1,9,""
43,1,10,"He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not."
43,1,11,"He came to his own, and his own received him not."
43,1,12,"But as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the sons of God,"
43,1,13,"Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."
43,1,14,"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."
43,1,15,"John bore witness concerning him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me."
43,1,16,"And of his fulness have we all received, and grace for grace."
43,1,17,"For the law was given by Moses,"
43,1,18,"No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared"
43,1,19,"And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?"
43,1,20,"And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ."
43,1,21,"And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No."
43,1,22,"Then said they to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?"
43,1,23,"He said, I"
43,1,24,"And they who were sent were of the Pharisees."
43,1,25,"And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?"
43,1,26,"John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;"
43,1,27,"He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe latchet I am not worthy to loose."
43,1,28,"These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing."
43,1,29,"The next day John seeth Jesus coming to him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world."
43,1,30,"This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is preferred before me: for he was before me."
43,1,31,"And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing in water."
43,1,32,"And John bore witness, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and he abode upon him."
43,1,33,"And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, the same said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizeth in the Holy Spirit."
43,1,34,"And I saw, and bore witness that this is the Son of God."
43,1,35,"Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;"
43,1,36,"And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!"
43,1,37,"And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus."
43,1,38,"Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith to them, What seek ye? They said to him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?"
43,1,39,"He saith to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour."
43,1,40,"One of the two who heard John"
43,1,41,"He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith to him, We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ."
43,1,42,"And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jonah: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone."
43,1,43,"The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith to him, Follow me."
43,1,44,"Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter."
43,1,45,"Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
43,1,46,"And Nathanael said to him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith to him, Come and see."
43,1,47,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"
43,1,48,"Nathanael saith to him, How knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee."
43,1,49,"Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel."
43,1,50,"Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, dost thou believe? thou shalt see greater things than these."
43,1,51,"And he saith to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, After this ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."
43,2,1,"And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:"
43,2,2,"And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the marriage."
43,2,3,"And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith to him, They have no wine."
43,2,4,"Jesus saith to her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? my hour is not yet come."
43,2,5,"His mother saith to the servants, Whatever he saith to you, do"
43,2,6,"And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece."
43,2,7,"Jesus saith to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them to the brim."
43,2,8,"And he saith to them, Draw out now, and bear to the governor of the feast. And they bore"
43,2,9,"When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not where it was from: (but the servants who drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,"
43,2,10,"And saith to him, Every man at the beginning serveth the good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse:"
43,2,11,"This beginning of miracles Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him."
43,2,12,"After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days."
43,2,13,"And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,"
43,2,14,"And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:"
43,2,15,"And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;"
43,2,16,"And said to them that sold doves, Take these things away; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise."
43,2,17,"And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up."
43,2,18,"Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign showest thou to us, seeing that thou doest these things?"
43,2,19,"Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
43,2,20,"Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?"
43,2,21,"But he spoke of the temple of his body."
43,2,22,"When therefore he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this to them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken."
43,2,23,"Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast"
43,2,24,"But Jesus did not commit himself to them, because he knew all"
43,2,25,"And needed not that any should testify concerning man: for he knew what was in man."
43,3,1,"There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:"
43,3,2,"The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him."
43,3,3,"Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
43,3,4,"Nicodemus saith to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?"
43,3,5,"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Except a man be born of water and"
43,3,6,"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
43,3,7,"Marvel not that I said to thee, Ye must be born again."
43,3,8,"The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the sound of it, but canst not tell where it cometh from, and where it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit."
43,3,9,"Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?"
43,3,10,"Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things?"
43,3,11,"Verily, verily, I say to thee, We speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; and ye receive not our witness."
43,3,12,"If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you heavenly things?"
43,3,13,"And no man hath ascended to heaven, but he that came down from heaven,"
43,3,14,"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:"
43,3,15,"That whoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life."
43,3,16,"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
43,3,17,"For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him may be saved."
43,3,18,"He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."
43,3,19,"And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil."
43,3,20,"For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved."
43,3,21,"But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God."
43,3,22,"After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized."
43,3,23,"And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized."
43,3,24,"For John was not yet cast into prison."
43,3,25,"Then there arose a question between"
43,3,26,"And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all"
43,3,27,"John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven."
43,3,28,"Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him."
43,3,29,"He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled."
43,3,30,"He must increase, but I"
43,3,31,"He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all."
43,3,32,"And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony."
43,3,33,"He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true."
43,3,34,"For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for"
43,3,35,"The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand."
43,3,36,"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him."
43,4,1,"When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,"
43,4,2,"(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)"
43,4,3,"He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee."
43,4,4,"And he must needs go through Samaria."
43,4,5,"Then he cometh to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph."
43,4,6,"Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with"
43,4,7,"There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink."
43,4,8,"(For his disciples had gone away to the city to buy food.)"
43,4,9,"Then saith the woman of Samaria to him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans."
43,4,10,"Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked him, and he would have given thee living water."
43,4,11,"The woman saith to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from where then hast thou that living water?"
43,4,12,"Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children, and his cattle?"
43,4,13,"Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:"
43,4,14,"But whoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life."
43,4,15,"The woman saith to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, neither come here to draw."
43,4,16,"Jesus saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come here."
43,4,17,"The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:"
43,4,18,"For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that thou hast spoken truth."
43,4,19,"The woman saith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet."
43,4,20,"Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship."
43,4,21,"Jesus saith to her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father."
43,4,22,"Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is from the Jews."
43,4,23,"But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him."
43,4,24,"God"
43,4,25,"The woman saith to him, I know that Messiah cometh, who is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things."
43,4,26,"Jesus saith to her, I that speak to thee am"
43,4,27,"And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?"
43,4,28,"The woman then left her waterpot, and went into the city, and saith to the men,"
43,4,29,"Come, see a man, who hath told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?"
43,4,30,"Then they went out of the city, and came to him."
43,4,31,"In the mean while his disciples urged him, saying, Master, eat."
43,4,32,"But he said to them, I have food to eat that ye know not of."
43,4,33,"Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him"
43,4,34,"Jesus saith to them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work."
43,4,35,"Say not ye, There are yet four months, and"
43,4,36,"And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit to life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together."
43,4,37,"And in this"
43,4,38,"I sent you to reap that on which ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye have entered into their labours."
43,4,39,"And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, who testified, He told me all that ever I did."
43,4,40,"So when the Samaritans had come to him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days."
43,4,41,"And many more believed because of his own word;"
43,4,42,"And said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard"
43,4,43,"Now after two days he departed from there, and went into Galilee."
43,4,44,"For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country."
43,4,45,"Then when he had come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast."
43,4,46,"So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water"
43,4,47,"When he heard that Jesus had come from Judaea into Galilee, he went to him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death."
43,4,48,"Then said Jesus to him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe."
43,4,49,"The nobleman saith to him, Sir, come down before my child dieth."
43,4,50,"Jesus saith to him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he departed."
43,4,51,"And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told"
43,4,52,"Then he enquired of them the hour when he began to get better. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."
43,4,53,"So the father knew that"
43,4,54,"This"
43,5,1,"After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
43,5,2,"Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep"
43,5,3,"In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, withered, waiting for the moving of the water."
43,5,4,"For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was healed of whatever disease he had."
43,5,5,"And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty and eight years."
43,5,6,"When Jesus saw him lying"
43,5,7,"The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me."
43,5,8,"Jesus saith to him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk."
43,5,9,"And immediately the man was healed, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath."
43,5,10,"The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath: it is not lawful for thee to carry"
43,5,11,"He answered them, He that healed me, the same said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk."
43,5,12,"Then they asked him, What man is that who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?"
43,5,13,"And he that was healed knew not who it was: for Jesus had withdrawn himself, a multitude being in"
43,5,14,"Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art cured: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to thee."
43,5,15,"The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, who had healed him."
43,5,16,"And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath."
43,5,17,"But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh until now, and I work."
43,5,18,"Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God."
43,5,19,"Then answered Jesus and said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing by himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for whatever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise."
43,5,20,"For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and he will show him greater works than these, that ye may marvel."
43,5,21,"For as the Father raiseth the dead, and giveth life to"
43,5,22,"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son:"
43,5,23,"That all"
43,5,24,"Verily, verily, I say to you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but hath passed from death to life."
43,5,25,"Verily, verily, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live."
43,5,26,"For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;"
43,5,27,"And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man."
43,5,28,"Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,"
43,5,29,"And shall come forth; they that have done good, to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation."
43,5,30,"I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who hath sent me."
43,5,31,"If I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is not true."
43,5,32,"There is another that beareth witness concerning me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth concerning me is true."
43,5,33,"Ye sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth."
43,5,34,"But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye may be saved."
43,5,35,"He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light."
43,5,36,"But I have greater witness than"
43,5,37,"And the Father himself, who hath sent me, hath borne witness concerning me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape."
43,5,38,"And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not."
43,5,39,"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me."
43,5,40,"And ye will not come to me, that ye may have life."
43,5,41,"I receive not honour from men."
43,5,42,"But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you."
43,5,43,"I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive."
43,5,44,"How can ye believe, who receive honour one from another, and seek not the honour that"
43,5,45,"Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is"
43,5,46,"For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote concerning me."
43,5,47,"But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?"
43,6,1,"After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is"
43,6,2,"And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he performed on them that were diseased."
43,6,3,"And Jesus went up on a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples."
43,6,4,"And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near."
43,6,5,"When Jesus then lifted up"
43,6,6,"And this he said to test him: for he himself knew what he would do."
43,6,7,"Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little."
43,6,8,"One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith to him,"
43,6,9,"There is a lad here, who hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?"
43,6,10,"And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand."
43,6,11,"And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were sitting down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would."
43,6,12,"When they were filled, he said to his disciples, Gather the fragments that remain, that nothing may be lost."
43,6,13,"Therefore they gathered"
43,6,14,"Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus performed, said, This is truly that prophet that should come into the world."
43,6,15,"When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again to a mountain himself alone."
43,6,16,"And when evening had"
43,6,17,"And entered into a boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them."
43,6,18,"And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew."
43,6,19,"So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat: and they were afraid."
43,6,20,"But he saith to them, It is I; be not afraid."
43,6,21,"Then they willingly received him into the boat: and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going."
43,6,22,"The day following, when the people who stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except that one into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but"
43,6,23,"(However there came other boats from Tiberias near to the place where they ate bread, after the Lord had given thanks:)"
43,6,24,"When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus."
43,6,25,"And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou here?"
43,6,26,"Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled."
43,6,27,"Labour not for the food which perisheth, but for that food which endureth to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him hath God the Father sealed."
43,6,28,"Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?"
43,6,29,"Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent."
43,6,30,"They said therefore to him, What sign showest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?"
43,6,31,"Our fathers ate manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat."
43,6,32,"Then Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven."
43,6,33,"For the bread of God is he who cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the world."
43,6,34,"Then said they to him, Lord, evermore give us this bread."
43,6,35,"And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst."
43,6,36,"But I said to you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not."
43,6,37,"All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will by no means cast out."
43,6,38,"For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me."
43,6,39,"And this is the Father’s will who hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise them up again at the last day."
43,6,40,"And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one who seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day."
43,6,41,"The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven."
43,6,42,"And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?"
43,6,43,"Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves."
43,6,44,"No man can come to me, except the Father who hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day."
43,6,45,"It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught from God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned from the Father, cometh to me."
43,6,46,"Not that any man hath seen the Father, except he who is from God, he hath seen the Father."
43,6,47,"Verily, verily, I say to you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life."
43,6,48,"I am that bread of life."
43,6,49,"Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness, and are dead."
43,6,50,"This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat of it, and not die."
43,6,51,"I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man shall eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."
43,6,52,"The Jews therefore"
43,6,53,"Then Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you."
43,6,54,"Whoever eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."
43,6,55,"For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed."
43,6,56,"He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him."
43,6,57,"As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me."
43,6,58,"This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers ate manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever."
43,6,59,"These things he said in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum."
43,6,60,"Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard"
43,6,61,"When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said to them, Doth this offend you?"
43,6,62,""
43,6,63,"It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak to you,"
43,6,64,"But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who he was that would betray him."
43,6,65,"And he said, Therefore I said to you, that no man can come to me, except it were given to him by my Father."
43,6,66,"From that"
43,6,67,"Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will ye also go away?"
43,6,68,"Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life."
43,6,69,"And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God."
43,6,70,"Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
43,6,71,"He spoke of Judas Iscariot"
43,7,1,"After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him."
43,7,2,"Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand."
43,7,3,"His brethren therefore said to him, Depart from here, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest."
43,7,4,"For"
43,7,5,"For neither did his brethren believe in him."
43,7,6,"Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready."
43,7,7,"The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify concerning it, that its works are evil."
43,7,8,"Go ye up to this feast: I go not up yet to this feast; for my time is not yet full come."
43,7,9,"When he had said these words to them, he abode"
43,7,10,"But when his brethren had gone up, then he went also to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret."
43,7,11,"Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?"
43,7,12,"And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some sayd, He is a good man: others sayd, Nay; but he deceiveth the people."
43,7,13,"Yet no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews."
43,7,14,"Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught."
43,7,15,"And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?"
43,7,16,"Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me."
43,7,17,"If any man will do his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God, or"
43,7,18,"He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him."
43,7,19,"Did not Moses give you the law, and"
43,7,20,"The people answered and said, Thou hast a demon: who goeth about to kill thee?"
43,7,21,"Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel."
43,7,22,"Moses therefore gave to you circumcision; (not because it is from Moses, but from the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath circumcise a man."
43,7,23,"If a man on the sabbath receiveth circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have restored a man to sound health on the sabbath?"
43,7,24,"Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment."
43,7,25,"Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?"
43,7,26,"But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?"
43,7,27,"But we know this man where he is from: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth where he is from."
43,7,28,"Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know where I am from: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not."
43,7,29,"But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me."
43,7,30,"Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come."
43,7,31,"And many of the people believed on him, and sayd, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this"
43,7,32,"The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him."
43,7,33,"Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and"
43,7,34,"Ye shall seek me, and shall not find"
43,7,35,"Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?"
43,7,36,"What"
43,7,37,"In the last day, that great"
43,7,38,"He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water."
43,7,39,"(But this he spoke of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Spirit was not yet"
43,7,40,"Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, In truth this is the Prophet."
43,7,41,"Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?"
43,7,42,"Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh from the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?"
43,7,43,"So there was a division among the people because of him."
43,7,44,"And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him."
43,7,45,"Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have ye not brought him?"
43,7,46,"The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man."
43,7,47,"Then the Pharisees answered them, Are ye also deceived?"
43,7,48,"Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?"
43,7,49,"But this people who know not the law are cursed."
43,7,50,"Nicodemus saith to them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)"
43,7,51,"Doth our law judge"
43,7,52,"They answered and said to him, Art thou also from Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet."
43,7,53,"And every man went to his own house."
43,8,1,"Jesus went to the mount of Olives."
43,8,2,"And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down, and taught them."
43,8,3,"And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,"
43,8,4,"They say to him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act."
43,8,5,"Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?"
43,8,6,"This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with"
43,8,7,"So when they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her."
43,8,8,"And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground."
43,8,9,"And they who heard"
43,8,10,"When Jesus had raised himself, and saw none but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those thy accusers? hath no man condemned thee?"
43,8,11,"She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more."
43,8,12,"Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
43,8,13,"The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou barest witness concerning thyself; thy witness is not true."
43,8,14,"Jesus answered and said to them, Though I witness concerning myself,"
43,8,15,"Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man."
43,8,16,"And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me."
43,8,17,"It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true."
43,8,18,"I am one that bear witness concerning myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness concerning me."
43,8,19,"Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also."
43,8,20,"These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come."
43,8,21,"Then said Jesus again to them, I am going away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I go, ye cannot come."
43,8,22,"Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Where I go, ye cannot come."
43,8,23,"And he said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world."
43,8,24,"I said therefore to you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am"
43,8,25,"Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith to them, Even"
43,8,26,"I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard from him."
43,8,27,"They understood not that he spoke to them concerning the Father."
43,8,28,"Then said Jesus to them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am"
43,8,29,"And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him."
43,8,30,"As he spoke these words, many believed on him."
43,8,31,"Then said Jesus to those Jews who believed on him, If ye continue in my word, ye are my disciples indeed;"
43,8,32,"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
43,8,33,"They answered him, We are Abraham’s offspring, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?"
43,8,34,"Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Whoever committeth sin is the servant of sin."
43,8,35,"And the servant abideth not in the house for ever:"
43,8,36,"If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."
43,8,37,"I know that ye are Abraham’s offspring; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you."
43,8,38,"I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father."
43,8,39,"They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham."
43,8,40,"But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard from God: this did not Abraham."
43,8,41,"Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We are not born of fornication; we have one Father,"
43,8,42,"Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me."
43,8,43,"Why do ye not understand my speech?"
43,8,44,"Ye are of"
43,8,45,"And because I tell"
43,8,46,"Which of you convicteth me of sin? And if I speak the truth, why do ye not believe me?"
43,8,47,"He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear"
43,8,48,"Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?"
43,8,49,"Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me."
43,8,50,"And I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth."
43,8,51,"Verily, verily, I say to you, If a man shall keep my saying, he shall never see death."
43,8,52,"Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man shall keep my saying, he shall never taste of death."
43,8,53,"Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?"
43,8,54,"Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:"
43,8,55,"Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like you: but I know him, and keep his saying."
43,8,56,"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw"
43,8,57,"Then said the Jews to him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?"
43,8,58,"Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am."
43,8,59,"Then they took up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by."
43,9,1,"And as"
43,9,2,"And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?"
43,9,3,"Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be revealed in him."
43,9,4,"I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work."
43,9,5,"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
43,9,6,"When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,"
43,9,7,"And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing."
43,9,8,"The neighbours therefore, and they who before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?"
43,9,9,"Some sayd, This is he: others"
43,9,10,"Therefore they said to him, How were thy eyes opened?"
43,9,11,"He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight."
43,9,12,"Then said they to him, Where is he? He said, I know not."
43,9,13,"They brought to the Pharisees him that before was blind."
43,9,14,"And it was the sabbath when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes."
43,9,15,"Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and do see."
43,9,16,"Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them."
43,9,17,"They say to the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thy eyes? He said, He is a prophet."
43,9,18,"But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight."
43,9,19,"And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?"
43,9,20,"His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:"
43,9,21,"But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself."
43,9,22,"These"
43,9,23,"Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him."
43,9,24,"Then again they called the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner."
43,9,25,"He answered and said, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, though I was blind, now I see."
43,9,26,"Then they said to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thy eyes?"
43,9,27,"He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: Why would ye hear"
43,9,28,"Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples."
43,9,29,"We know that God spoke to Moses:"
43,9,30,"The man answered and said to them, Why here is a marvellous thing, that ye know not where he is from, and"
43,9,31,"Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man is a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth."
43,9,32,"Since the world began hath it not been heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind."
43,9,33,"If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."
43,9,34,"They answered and said to him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out."
43,9,35,"Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said to him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?"
43,9,36,"He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?"
43,9,37,"And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee."
43,9,38,"And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him."
43,9,39,"And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they who see not may see; and that they who see may be made blind."
43,9,40,"And"
43,9,41,"Jesus said to them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth."
43,10,1,"Verily, verily, I say to you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber."
43,10,2,"But he that entereth by the door is the shepherd of the sheep."
43,10,3,"To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out."
43,10,4,"And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice."
43,10,5,"And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers."
43,10,6,"This parable spoke Jesus to them: but they understood not what things they were which he spoke to them."
43,10,7,"Then said Jesus to them again, Verily, verily, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep."
43,10,8,"All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them."
43,10,9,"I am the door: by me if any man shall enter, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture."
43,10,10,"The thief cometh not, but to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they may have life, and that they may have"
43,10,11,"I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep."
43,10,12,"But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep."
43,10,13,"The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep."
43,10,14,"I am the good shepherd, and know my"
43,10,15,"As the Father knoweth me, even so I know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep."
43,10,16,"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold,"
43,10,17,"Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again."
43,10,18,"No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received from my Father."
43,10,19,"There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings."
43,10,20,"And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is mad; why hear ye him?"
43,10,21,"Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"
43,10,22,"And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter."
43,10,23,"And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch."
43,10,24,"Then came the Jews around him, and said to him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly."
43,10,25,"Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness concerning me."
43,10,26,"But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you."
43,10,27,"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:"
43,10,28,"And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand."
43,10,29,"My Father, who gave"
43,10,30,"I and"
43,10,31,"Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him."
43,10,32,"Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shown you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?"
43,10,33,"The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God."
43,10,34,"Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?"
43,10,35,"If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;"
43,10,36,"Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?"
43,10,37,"If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not."
43,10,38,"But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father"
43,10,39,"Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped from their hand,"
43,10,40,"And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode."
43,10,41,"And many resorted to him, and sayd, John performed no miracle: but all things that John spoke of this man were true."
43,10,42,"And many believed on him there."
43,11,1,"Now a certain"
43,11,2,"(It was"
43,11,3,"Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick."
43,11,4,"When Jesus heard"
43,11,5,"Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus."
43,11,6,"When therefore he had heard that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was."
43,11,7,"Then after that he saith to"
43,11,8,""
43,11,9,"Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walketh in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world."
43,11,10,"But if a man walketh in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him."
43,11,11,"These things he said: and after that he saith to them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep."
43,11,12,"Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleepeth, he shall do well."
43,11,13,"Now Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking rest in sleep."
43,11,14,"Then said Jesus to them plainly, Lazarus is dead."
43,11,15,"And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go to him."
43,11,16,"Then said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him."
43,11,17,"Then when Jesus came, he found that he had"
43,11,18,"Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:"
43,11,19,"And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother."
43,11,20,"Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat in the house."
43,11,21,"Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died."
43,11,22,"But I know, that even now, whatever thou wilt ask of God, God will give"
43,11,23,"Jesus saith to her, Thy brother shall rise again."
43,11,24,"Martha saith to him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
43,11,25,"Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:"
43,11,26,"And whoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?"
43,11,27,"She saith to him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."
43,11,28,"And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee."
43,11,29,"As soon as she heard"
43,11,30,"Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him."
43,11,31,"The Jews then who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth to the grave to weep there."
43,11,32,"Then when Mary had come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died."
43,11,33,"When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,"
43,11,34,"And said, Where have ye laid him? They said to him, Lord, come and see."
43,11,35,"Jesus wept."
43,11,36,"Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!"
43,11,37,"And some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?"
43,11,38,"Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it."
43,11,39,"Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him, Lord, by this time his body smelleth: for he hath been"
43,11,40,"Jesus saith to her, Said I not to thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?"
43,11,41,"Then they took away the stone"
43,11,42,"And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people who stand by I said"
43,11,43,"And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth."
43,11,44,"And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a cloth. Jesus saith to them, Loose him, and let him go."
43,11,45,"Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him."
43,11,46,"But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done."
43,11,47,"Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man performeth many miracles."
43,11,48,"If we let him thus alone, all"
43,11,49,"And one of them,"
43,11,50,"Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not."
43,11,51,"And this he spoke not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;"
43,11,52,"And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad."
43,11,53,"Then from that day forth they took counsel together to put him to death."
43,11,54,"Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went from there to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples."
43,11,55,"And the Jews’ passover was near at hand: and many went out of the country to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves."
43,11,56,"Then they sought for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?"
43,11,57,"Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show"
43,12,1,"Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead."
43,12,2,"There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him."
43,12,3,"Then Mary took a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment."
43,12,4,"Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s"
43,12,5,"Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?"
43,12,6,"This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put in it."
43,12,7,"Then said Jesus, Let her alone: for the day of my burial hath she kept this."
43,12,8,"For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always."
43,12,9,"Many people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead."
43,12,10,"But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;"
43,12,11,"Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus."
43,12,12,"On the next day many people that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,"
43,12,13,"Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed"
43,12,14,"And Jesus, when he had found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written,"
43,12,15,"Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on a donkey’s colt."
43,12,16,"These things his disciples understood not at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written concerning him, and"
43,12,17,"The people therefore that were with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bore witness."
43,12,18,"For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle."
43,12,19,"The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him."
43,12,20,"And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:"
43,12,21,"The same came therefore to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus."
43,12,22,"Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus."
43,12,23,"And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified."
43,12,24,"Verily, verily, I say to you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."
43,12,25,"He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal."
43,12,26,"If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will"
43,12,27,"Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause I came to this hour."
43,12,28,"Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,"
43,12,29,"The people therefore, that stood by, and heard"
43,12,30,"Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes."
43,12,31,"Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out."
43,12,32,"And I, if I shall be lifted up from the earth, will draw all"
43,12,33,"This he said, signifying what death he should die."
43,12,34,"The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?"
43,12,35,"Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not where he goeth."
43,12,36,"While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and was hidden from them."
43,12,37,"But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:"
43,12,38,"That the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
43,12,39,"Therefore they could not believe, because that Isaiah said again,"
43,12,40,"He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with"
43,12,41,"These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him."
43,12,42,"Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess"
43,12,43,"For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God."
43,12,44,"Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me."
43,12,45,"And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me."
43,12,46,"I am come a light into the world, that whoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness."
43,12,47,"And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world."
43,12,48,"He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."
43,12,49,"For I have not spoken from myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak."
43,12,50,"And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatever I speak therefore, even as the Father said to me, so I speak."
43,13,1,"Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end."
43,13,2,"And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s"
43,13,3,"Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was going to God;"
43,13,4,"He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself."
43,13,5,"After that he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe"
43,13,6,"Then he cometh to Simon Peter: and Peter saith to him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?"
43,13,7,"Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know after this."
43,13,8,"Peter saith to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me."
43,13,9,"Simon Peter saith to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also"
43,13,10,"Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not except to wash"
43,13,11,"For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean."
43,13,12,"So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was seated again, he said to them, Know ye what I have done to you?"
43,13,13,"Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for"
43,13,14,"If I then,"
43,13,15,"For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you."
43,13,16,"Verily, verily, I say to you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him."
43,13,17,"If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them."
43,13,18,"I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me."
43,13,19,"Now I tell you before it cometh, that, when it hath come to pass, ye may believe that I am"
43,13,20,"Verily, verily, I say to you, He that receiveth whomever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me."
43,13,21,"When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, that one of you shall betray me."
43,13,22,"Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke."
43,13,23,"Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved."
43,13,24,"Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, to ask who it should be of whom he spoke."
43,13,25,"He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith to him, Lord, who is it?"
43,13,26,"Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped"
43,13,27,"And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, What thou doest, do quickly."
43,13,28,"Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him."
43,13,29,"For some"
43,13,30,"He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night."
43,13,31,"Therefore, when he had gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him."
43,13,32,"If God is glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall immediately glorify him."
43,13,33,"Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you."
43,13,34,"A new commandment I give to you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another."
43,13,35,"By this shall all"
43,13,36,"Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where goest thou? Jesus answered him, Where I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards."
43,13,37,"Peter said to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake."
43,13,38,"Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say to thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me three times."
43,14,1,"Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me."
43,14,2,"In my Father’s house are many mansions: if"
43,14,3,"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am,"
43,14,4,"And where I go ye know, and the way ye know."
43,14,5,"Thomas saith to him, Lord, we know not where thou goest; and how can we know the way?"
43,14,6,"Jesus saith to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh to the Father, but by me."
43,14,7,"If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him."
43,14,8,"Philip saith to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us."
43,14,9,"Jesus saith to him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou"
43,14,10,"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I speak not from myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works."
43,14,11,"Believe me that I"
43,14,12,"Verily, verily, I say to you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater"
43,14,13,"And whatever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
43,14,14,"If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do"
43,14,15,"If ye love me, keep my commandments."
43,14,16,"And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;"
43,14,17,""
43,14,18,"I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you."
43,14,19,"Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also."
43,14,20,"At that day ye shall know that I"
43,14,21,"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to him."
43,14,22,"Judas, not Iscariot, saith to him, Lord, how is it that thou wilt reveal thyself to us, and not to the world?"
43,14,23,"Jesus answered and said to him, If a man loveth me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him."
43,14,24,"He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but that of the Father who sent me."
43,14,25,"These things have I spoken to you, being"
43,14,26,"But the Comforter,"
43,14,27,"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world giveth, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."
43,14,28,"Ye have heard that I said to you, I go away, and come"
43,14,29,"And now I have told you before it cometh to pass, that, when it hath come to pass, ye may believe."
43,14,30,"After this I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me."
43,14,31,"But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here."
43,15,1,"I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser."
43,15,2,"Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every"
43,15,3,"Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken to you."
43,15,4,"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me."
43,15,5,"I am the vine, ye"
43,15,6,"If a man abideth not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast"
43,15,7,"If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done to you."
43,15,8,"In this is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples."
43,15,9,"As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love."
43,15,10,"If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love."
43,15,11,"These things have I spoken to you, that my joy may remain in you, and"
43,15,12,"This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you."
43,15,13,"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."
43,15,14,"Ye are my friends, if ye do whatever I command you."
43,15,15,"Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you."
43,15,16,"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and"
43,15,17,"These things I command you, that ye love one another."
43,15,18,"If the world hateth you, ye know that it hated me before"
43,15,19,"If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you."
43,15,20,"Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also."
43,15,21,"But all these things will they do to you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me."
43,15,22,"If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin."
43,15,23,"He that hateth me hateth my Father also."
43,15,24,"If I had not done among them the works which no other man hath done, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father."
43,15,25,"But"
43,15,26,"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father,"
43,15,27,"And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning."
43,16,1,"These things have I spoken to you, that ye should not be offended."
43,16,2,"They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service."
43,16,3,"And these things will they do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me."
43,16,4,"But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not to you at the beginning, because I was with you."
43,16,5,"But now I go to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Where goest thou?"
43,16,6,"But because I have said these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart."
43,16,7,"Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you."
43,16,8,"And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:"
43,16,9,"Of sin, because they believe not on me;"
43,16,10,"Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;"
43,16,11,"Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged."
43,16,12,"I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now."
43,16,13,"But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but whatever he shall hear,"
43,16,14,"He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show"
43,16,15,"All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore I said, that he shall take of mine, and show"
43,16,16,"A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father."
43,16,17,"Then said"
43,16,18,"They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith."
43,16,19,"Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said to them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that which I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?"
43,16,20,"Verily, verily, I say to you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy."
43,16,21,"A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world."
43,16,22,"And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you."
43,16,23,"And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say to you, Whatever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give"
43,16,24,"Until now ye have asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full."
43,16,25,"These things have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly concerning the Father."
43,16,26,"At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you:"
43,16,27,"For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came from God."
43,16,28,"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father."
43,16,29,"His disciples said to him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb."
43,16,30,"Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest from God."
43,16,31,"Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?"
43,16,32,"Behold, the hour cometh, and, is even now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me."
43,16,33,"These things I have spoken to you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."
43,17,1,"These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:"
43,17,2,"As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him."
43,17,3,"And this is life eternal, that they may know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."
43,17,4,"I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do."
43,17,5,"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thy own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was."
43,17,6,"I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest to me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word."
43,17,7,"Now they have known that all things whatever thou hast given me are from thee."
43,17,8,"For I have given to them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received"
43,17,9,"I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given to me; for they are thine."
43,17,10,"And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them."
43,17,11,"And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thy own name those whom thou hast given to me, that they may be one, as we"
43,17,12,"While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest to me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled."
43,17,13,"And now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves."
43,17,14,"I have given to them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
43,17,15,"I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil."
43,17,16,"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
43,17,17,"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth."
43,17,18,"As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world."
43,17,19,"And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth."
43,17,20,"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also who shall believe on me through their word;"
43,17,21,"That they all may be one; as thou, Father,"
43,17,22,"And the glory which thou gavest to me I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one:"
43,17,23,"I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me."
43,17,24,"Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given to me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given to me: for thou didst love me before the foundation of the world."
43,17,25,"O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me."
43,17,26,"And I have declared to them thy name, and will declare"
43,18,1,"When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into which he entered, and his disciples."
43,18,2,"And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus often resorted there with his disciples."
43,18,3,"Judas then, having received a band"
43,18,4,"Jesus therefore, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth, and said to them, Whom seek ye?"
43,18,5,"They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith to them, I am"
43,18,6,"As soon then as he had said to them, I am"
43,18,7,"Then he asked them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth."
43,18,8,"Jesus answered, I have told you that I am"
43,18,9,"That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Of them whom thou gavest to me, I have lost none."
43,18,10,"Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus."
43,18,11,"Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?"
43,18,12,"Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,"
43,18,13,"And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest that same year."
43,18,14,"Now Caiaphas was he, who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people."
43,18,15,"And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and"
43,18,16,"But Peter stood at the door outside. Then went out that other disciple, who was known to the high priest, and spoke to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter."
43,18,17,"Then saith the maid that kept the door to Peter, Art not thou also"
43,18,18,"And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself."
43,18,19,"The high priest then asked Jesus concerning his disciples, and concerning his doctrine."
43,18,20,"Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing."
43,18,21,"Why dost thou ask me? ask them who heard me, what I have said to them: behold, they know what I have said."
43,18,22,"And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?"
43,18,23,"Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?"
43,18,24,"Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest."
43,18,25,"And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore to him, Art not thou also"
43,18,26,"One of the servants of the high priest, being the kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?"
43,18,27,"Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crowed."
43,18,28,"Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover."
43,18,29,"Pilate then went out to them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?"
43,18,30,"They answered and said to him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee."
43,18,31,"Then said Pilate to them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:"
43,18,32,"That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what death he should die."
43,18,33,"Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Art thou the King of the Jews?"
43,18,34,"Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing from thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me?"
43,18,35,"Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee to me: what hast thou done?"
43,18,36,"Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from here."
43,18,37,"Pilate therefore said to him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice."
43,18,38,"Pilate saith to him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them, I find in him no fault."
43,18,39,"But ye have a custom, that I should release to you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews?"
43,18,40,"Then they all cried again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber."
43,19,1,"Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged"
43,19,2,"And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put"
43,19,3,"And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands."
43,19,4,"Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith to them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him."
43,19,5,"Then Jesus came forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And"
43,19,6,"When therefore the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify"
43,19,7,"The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."
43,19,8,"When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;"
43,19,9,"And went again into the judgment hall, and saith to Jesus, Where art thou from? But Jesus gave him no answer."
43,19,10,"Then saith Pilate to him, Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?"
43,19,11,"Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me to thee hath the greater sin."
43,19,12,"And from then on Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend: Whoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar."
43,19,13,"When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down on the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha."
43,19,14,"And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith to the Jews, Behold your King!"
43,19,15,"But they cried out, Away with"
43,19,16,"Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led"
43,19,17,"And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called"
43,19,18,"Where they crucified him, and two others with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst."
43,19,19,"And Pilate wrote a title, and put"
43,19,20,"Many of the Jews then read this title: for the place where Jesus was crucified was near to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, Greek,"
43,19,21,"Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews."
43,19,22,"Pilate answered, What I have written I have written."
43,19,23,"Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also"
43,19,24,"They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did."
43,19,25,"Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the"
43,19,26,"When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!"
43,19,27,"Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her to his own"
43,19,28,"After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst."
43,19,29,"Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put"
43,19,30,"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost."
43,19,31,"The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath, (for that sabbath was a great day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and"
43,19,32,"Then came the soldiers, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him."
43,19,33,"But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs:"
43,19,34,"But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came out blood and water."
43,19,35,"And he that saw"
43,19,36,"For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken."
43,19,37,"And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced."
43,19,38,"And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave"
43,19,39,"And there came also Nicodemus, who at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound"
43,19,40,"Then they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury."
43,19,41,"Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, in which was never man yet laid."
43,19,42,"There they laid Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation"
43,20,1,"The first"
43,20,2,"Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him."
43,20,3,"Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre."
43,20,4,"So they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the sepulchre."
43,20,5,"And he stooping down, saw the linen cloths lying; yet he went not in."
43,20,6,"Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen cloths lying"
43,20,7,"And the cloth, that was about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but wrapped together in a place by itself."
43,20,8,"Then went in also that other disciple, who came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed."
43,20,9,"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead."
43,20,10,"Then the disciples went away again to their own home."
43,20,11,"But Mary stood outside of the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down,"
43,20,12,"And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain."
43,20,13,"And they say to her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him."
43,20,14,"And when she had thus said, she turned herself around, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus."
43,20,15,"Jesus saith to her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him away, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away."
43,20,16,"Jesus saith to her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith to him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master."
43,20,17,"Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I have not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and"
43,20,18,"Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and"
43,20,19,"Then the same day at evening, being the first"
43,20,20,"And when he had so said, he showed to them"
43,20,21,"Then said Jesus to them again, Peace"
43,20,22,"And when he had said this, he breathed on"
43,20,23,"Whose sins ye remit, they are remitted to them;"
43,20,24,"But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came."
43,20,25,"The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe."
43,20,26,"And after eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas with them:"
43,20,27,"Then saith he to Thomas, Reach here thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach here thy hand, and thrust"
43,20,28,"And Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God."
43,20,29,"Jesus saith to him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed"
43,20,30,"And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:"
43,20,31,"But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life through his name."
43,21,1,"After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and in this manner did he show"
43,21,2,"There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the"
43,21,3,"Simon Peter saith to them, I am going fishing. They say to him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a boat immediately; and that night they caught nothing."
43,21,4,"But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus."
43,21,5,"Then Jesus saith to them, Children, have ye any fish? They answered him, No."
43,21,6,"And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes."
43,21,7,"Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt"
43,21,8,"And the other disciples came in a little boat; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes."
43,21,9,"As soon then as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on them, and bread."
43,21,10,"Jesus saith to them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught."
43,21,11,"Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and although there were so many, yet the net was not broken."
43,21,12,"Jesus saith to them, Come"
43,21,13,"Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise."
43,21,14,"This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead."
43,21,15,"So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon,"
43,21,16,"He saith to him again the second time, Simon,"
43,21,17,"He saith to him the third time, Simon,"
43,21,18,"Verily, verily, I say to thee, When thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself, and didst walk where thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry"
43,21,19,"This he spoke, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith to him, Follow me."
43,21,20,"Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?"
43,21,21,"Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what"
43,21,22,"Jesus saith to him, If I will that he shall tarry till I come, what"
43,21,23,"Then this saying went abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not to him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he shall tarry till I come, what"
43,21,24,"This is the disciple who testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true."
43,21,25,"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen."
44,1,1,"The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,"
44,1,2,"Until the day when he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen:"
44,1,3,"To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen by them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:"
44,1,4,"And, being assembled with"
44,1,5,"For John truly baptized in water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now."
44,1,6,"When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?"
44,1,7,"And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power."
44,1,8,"But ye shall receive power, after the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth."
44,1,9,"And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight."
44,1,10,"And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;"
44,1,11,"Who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up to heaven? this same Jesus, who is taken from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven."
44,1,12,"Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day’s journey."
44,1,13,"And when they had come in, they went into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James"
44,1,14,"These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren."
44,1,15,"And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of the names together were about an hundred and twenty,)"
44,1,16,"Men, brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus."
44,1,17,"For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry."
44,1,18,"Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out."
44,1,19,"And it was known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; therefore that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood."
44,1,20,"For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell in it: and his office let another take."
44,1,21,"Therefore of these men who accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,"
44,1,22,"Beginning from the baptism of John, to that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection."
44,1,23,"And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias."
44,1,24,"And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all"
44,1,25,"That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place."
44,1,26,"And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles."
44,2,1,"And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place."
44,2,2,"And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting."
44,2,3,"And there appeared to them cloven tongues as of fire, and it sat upon each of them."
44,2,4,"And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance."
44,2,5,"And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven."
44,2,6,"Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because every man heard them speak in his own language."
44,2,7,"And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these who speak Galilaeans?"
44,2,8,"And how do we hear every man in our own language, in which we were born?"
44,2,9,"Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,"
44,2,10,"Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,"
44,2,11,"Cretes and Arabians, we hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God."
44,2,12,"And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, What meaneth this?"
44,2,13,"Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine."
44,2,14,"But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, Ye men of Judaea, and all"
44,2,15,"For these are not drunk, as ye suppose, seeing it is"
44,2,16,"But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;"
44,2,17,"And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:"
44,2,18,"And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will, in those, days pour out of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:"
44,2,19,"And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:"
44,2,20,"The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:"
44,2,21,"And it shall come to pass,"
44,2,22,"Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:"
44,2,23,"Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:"
44,2,24,"Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held by it."
44,2,25,"For David speaketh concerning him, I saw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:"
44,2,26,"Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:"
44,2,27,"Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou allow thy Holy One to see corruption."
44,2,28,"Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance."
44,2,29,"Men, brethren, let me freely speak to you concerning the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us to this day."
44,2,30,"Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath, that from the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;"
44,2,31,"He seeing this before spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither did his flesh see corruption."
44,2,32,"This Jesus hath God raised up, of which we all are witnesses."
44,2,33,"Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear."
44,2,34,"For David did not ascend into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,"
44,2,35,"Until I make thy foes thy footstool."
44,2,36,"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ."
44,2,37,"Now when they heard"
44,2,38,"Then Peter said to them, Repent ye, and each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."
44,2,39,"For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off,"
44,2,40,"And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation."
44,2,41,"Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added"
44,2,42,"And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers."
44,2,43,"And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles."
44,2,44,"And all that believed were together, and had all things"
44,2,45,"And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all"
44,2,46,"And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, ate their food with gladness and singleness of heart,"
44,2,47,"Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved."
44,3,1,"Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer,"
44,3,2,"And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;"
44,3,3,"Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked alms."
44,3,4,"And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us."
44,3,5,"And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something from them."
44,3,6,"Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have I give thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk."
44,3,7,"And he took him by the right hand, and lifted"
44,3,8,"And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God."
44,3,9,"And all the people saw him walking and praising God:"
44,3,10,"And they knew that it was he who sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him."
44,3,11,"And as the lame man who was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering."
44,3,12,"And when Peter saw"
44,3,13,"The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let"
44,3,14,"But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted to you;"
44,3,15,"And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; to which we are witnesses."
44,3,16,"And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all."
44,3,17,"And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance ye did"
44,3,18,"But those things, which God before had shown by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled."
44,3,19,"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;"
44,3,20,"And he shall send Jesus Christ, who before was preached to you:"
44,3,21,"Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began."
44,3,22,"For Moses truly said to the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brethren, like me; him shall ye hear in all things whatever he shall say to you."
44,3,23,"And it shall come to pass,"
44,3,24,"Yea, and all the prophets also from Samuel and those that follow, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold these days."
44,3,25,"Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed."
44,3,26,"To you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away each one of you from his iniquities."
44,4,1,"And as they were speaking to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,"
44,4,2,"Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead."
44,4,3,"And they laid hands on them, and put"
44,4,4,"But many of them who heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand."
44,4,5,"And it came to pass on the next day, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,"
44,4,6,"And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem."
44,4,7,"And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?"
44,4,8,"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,"
44,4,9,"If we this day are examined concerning the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made well;"
44,4,10,"Be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead,"
44,4,11,"This is the stone which was rejected by you builders, which is become the head of the corner."
44,4,12,"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is no other name under heaven given among men, by which we must be saved."
44,4,13,"Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus."
44,4,14,"And beholding the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it."
44,4,15,"But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,"
44,4,16,"Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them"
44,4,17,"But that it may spread no further among the people, let us strictly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name."
44,4,18,"And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus."
44,4,19,"But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken to you rather than to God, judge ye."
44,4,20,"For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard."
44,4,21,"So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all"
44,4,22,"For the man was over forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was performed."
44,4,23,"And being released, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them."
44,4,24,"And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou"
44,4,25,"Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?"
44,4,26,"The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ."
44,4,27,"For in truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,"
44,4,28,"To do whatever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done."
44,4,29,"And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant to thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,"
44,4,30,"By stretching forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus."
44,4,31,"And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness."
44,4,32,"And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any"
44,4,33,"And with great power the apostles gave witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all."
44,4,34,"Neither was there any among them that was needy: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,"
44,4,35,"And laid"
44,4,36,"And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite,"
44,4,37,"Having land, sold"
44,5,1,"But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,"
44,5,2,"And kept back"
44,5,3,"But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back"
44,5,4,"While it remained, was it not thy own? and after it was sold, was it not in thy own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? thou hast not lied to men, but to God."
44,5,5,"And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and died: and great fear came on all them that heard these things."
44,5,6,"And the young men arose, wrapped him up, and carried"
44,5,7,"And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in."
44,5,8,"And Peter answered to her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much."
44,5,9,"Then Peter said to her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them who have buried thy husband"
44,5,10,"Then she fell down immediately at his feet, and died: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying"
44,5,11,"And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things."
44,5,12,"And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch."
44,5,13,"And of the rest dared no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them."
44,5,14,"And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)"
44,5,15,"So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid"
44,5,16,"There came also a multitude"
44,5,17,"Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,"
44,5,18,"And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison."
44,5,19,"But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,"
44,5,20,"Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."
44,5,21,"And when they heard"
44,5,22,"But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,"
44,5,23,"Saying, The prison truly we found shut with all safety, and the keepers standing outside before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within."
44,5,24,"Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they were greatly perplexed about them as to what would come of this."
44,5,25,"Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people."
44,5,26,"Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned."
44,5,27,"And when they had brought them, they set"
44,5,28,"Saying, Did we not strictly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us."
44,5,29,"Then Peter and the"
44,5,30,"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree."
44,5,31,"Him hath God exalted with his right hand"
44,5,32,"And we are his witnesses of these things; and"
44,5,33,"When they heard"
44,5,34,"Then stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little time;"
44,5,35,"And said to them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do concerning these men."
44,5,36,"For before these days rose Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought."
44,5,37,"After this man rose Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away many people after him: he also perished; and all,"
44,5,38,"And now I say to you, Stay away from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work is from men, it will come to nothing:"
44,5,39,"But if it is from God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest perhaps ye be found even to fight against God."
44,5,40,"And to him they assented: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten"
44,5,41,"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name."
44,5,42,"And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ."
44,6,1,"And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration."
44,6,2,"Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples, and said, It is not desirable that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables."
44,6,3,"Therefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business."
44,6,4,"But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word."
44,6,5,"And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:"
44,6,6,"Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid"
44,6,7,"And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith."
44,6,8,"And Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and miracles among the people."
44,6,9,"Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called"
44,6,10,"And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke."
44,6,11,"Then they secretly induced men, who sayd, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and"
44,6,12,"And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon"
44,6,13,"And set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:"
44,6,14,"For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered to us."
44,6,15,"And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel."
44,7,1,"Then said the high priest, Are these things so?"
44,7,2,"And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,"
44,7,3,"And said to him, Depart from thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee."
44,7,4,"Then he came from the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Haran: and from there, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, in which ye now dwell."
44,7,5,"And he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not"
44,7,6,"And God spoke in this way, That his offspring should sojourn in a foreign land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and oppress"
44,7,7,"And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that they shall come forth, and serve me in this place."
44,7,8,"And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so"
44,7,9,"And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,"
44,7,10,"And delivered him from all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house."
44,7,11,"Now there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance."
44,7,12,"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first."
44,7,13,"And at the second"
44,7,14,"Then Joseph sent, and called his father Jacob to"
44,7,15,"So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,"
44,7,16,"And were carried over into Shechem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor"
44,7,17,"But when the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,"
44,7,18,"Till another king arose, who knew not Joseph."
44,7,19,"The same dealt treacherously with our kindred, and oppressed our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live."
44,7,20,"In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished in his father’s house three months:"
44,7,21,"And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son."
44,7,22,"And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds."
44,7,23,"And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel."
44,7,24,"And seeing one"
44,7,25,"For he supposed his brethren to understand that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not."
44,7,26,"And the next day he showed himself to them as they were fighting, and would have constrained them to be at peace again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?"
44,7,27,"But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?"
44,7,28,"Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday?"
44,7,29,"Then Moses fled at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons."
44,7,30,"And when forty years had passed, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush."
44,7,31,"When Moses saw"
44,7,32,""
44,7,33,"Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground."
44,7,34,"I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt."
44,7,35,"This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send"
44,7,36,"He brought them out, after he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years."
44,7,37,"This is that Moses, who said to the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brethren, like me; him shall ye hear."
44,7,38,"This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on the mount Sinai, and"
44,7,39,"Whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust"
44,7,40,"Saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for"
44,7,41,"And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands."
44,7,42,"Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices"
44,7,43,"Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Molech, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon."
44,7,44,"Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen."
44,7,45,"Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Joshua into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David;"
44,7,46,"Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob."
44,7,47,"But Solomon built for him an house."
44,7,48,"Yet the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,"
44,7,49,"Heaven"
44,7,50,"Hath not my hand made all these things?"
44,7,51,"Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers"
44,7,52,"Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them who showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:"
44,7,53,"Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept"
44,7,54,"When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with"
44,7,55,"But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,"
44,7,56,"And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God."
44,7,57,"Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,"
44,7,58,"And cast"
44,7,59,"And they stoned Stephen, calling upon"
44,7,60,"And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep."
44,8,1,"And Saul was consenting to his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles."
44,8,2,"And devout men carried Stephen"
44,8,3,"As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and dragging off men and women committed"
44,8,4,"Therefore they that were scattered went every where preaching the word."
44,8,5,"Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ to them."
44,8,6,"And the people with one accord gave heed to those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles which he was performing."
44,8,7,"For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed and many sick with palsies, and that were lame, were healed."
44,8,8,"And there was great joy in that city."
44,8,9,"But there was a certain man, called Simon, who before in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, saying that he was some great person:"
44,8,10,"To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God."
44,8,11,"And to him they had regard, because that for a long time he had bewitched them with sorceries."
44,8,12,"But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women."
44,8,13,"Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and was amazed, beholding the miracles and signs which were done."
44,8,14,"Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:"
44,8,15,"Who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:"
44,8,16,"(For as yet he had fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)"
44,8,17,"Then they laid"
44,8,18,"And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,"
44,8,19,"Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit."
44,8,20,"But Peter said to him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money."
44,8,21,"Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God."
44,8,22,"Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee."
44,8,23,"For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and"
44,8,24,"Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me."
44,8,25,"And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans."
44,8,26,"And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert."
44,8,27,"And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship,"
44,8,28,"Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Isaiah the prophet."
44,8,29,"Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot."
44,8,30,"And Philip ran to"
44,8,31,"And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he besought Philip that he would come up and sit with him."
44,8,32,"The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so he opened not his mouth:"
44,8,33,"In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth."
44,8,34,"And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?"
44,8,35,"Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached to him Jesus."
44,8,36,"And as they went on"
44,8,37,"And Philip said, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."
44,8,38,"And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him."
44,8,39,"And when they had come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing."
44,8,40,"But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea."
44,9,1,"And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,"
44,9,2,"And desired from him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem."
44,9,3,"And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shone around him a light from heaven:"
44,9,4,"And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
44,9,5,"And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest:"
44,9,6,"And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord"
44,9,7,"And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man."
44,9,8,"And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought"
44,9,9,"And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank."
44,9,10,"And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I"
44,9,11,"And the Lord"
44,9,12,"And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting"
44,9,13,"Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:"
44,9,14,"And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name."
44,9,15,"But the Lord said to him, Go: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:"
44,9,16,"For I will show him what great things he must suffer for my name’s sake."
44,9,17,"And Ananias went, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord,"
44,9,18,"And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight immediately, and arose, and was baptized."
44,9,19,"And when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples who were at Damascus."
44,9,20,"And immediately he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God."
44,9,21,"But all that heard"
44,9,22,"But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ."
44,9,23,"And after many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:"
44,9,24,"But their laying in wait was known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him."
44,9,25,"Then the disciples took him by night, and let"
44,9,26,"And when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple."
44,9,27,"But Barnabas took him, and brought"
44,9,28,"And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem."
44,9,29,"And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him."
44,9,30,""
44,9,31,"Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, were multiplied."
44,9,32,"And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all"
44,9,33,"And there he found a certain man named Æneas, who had kept his bed eight years, and was sick with the palsy."
44,9,34,"And Peter said to him, Æneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately."
44,9,35,"And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord."
44,9,36,"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, who by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did."
44,9,37,"And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid in an upper chamber."
44,9,38,"And as Lydda was near to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent to him two men, desiring"
44,9,39,"Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them."
44,9,40,"But Peter put them all out, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up."
44,9,41,"And he gave her"
44,9,42,"And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord."
44,9,43,"And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner."
44,10,1,"There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian"
44,10,2,""
44,10,3,"He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius."
44,10,4,"And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thy alms are come up for a memorial before God."
44,10,5,"And now send men to Joppa, and call for"
44,10,6,"He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do."
44,10,7,"And when the angel who spoke to Cornelius had departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;"
44,10,8,"And when he had declared all"
44,10,9,"On the next day, as they were going on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:"
44,10,10,"And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,"
44,10,11,"And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending to him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:"
44,10,12,"In which were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air."
44,10,13,"And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat."
44,10,14,"But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean."
44,10,15,"And the voice"
44,10,16,"This was done three times: and the vessel was received up again into heaven."
44,10,17,"Now while Peter greatly perplexed in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,"
44,10,18,"And called, and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, lodged there."
44,10,19,"While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee."
44,10,20,"Arise therefore, and go down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them."
44,10,21,"Then Peter went down to the men who were sent to him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what"
44,10,22,"And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words from thee."
44,10,23,"Then he called them in, and lodged"
44,10,24,"And on the next day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends."
44,10,25,"And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped"
44,10,26,"But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man."
44,10,27,"And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that had come together."
44,10,28,"And he said to them, Ye know that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come to one of another nation; but God hath shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean."
44,10,29,"Therefore I came"
44,10,30,"And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,"
44,10,31,"And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thy alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God."
44,10,32,"Send therefore to Joppa, and call here Simon, whose surname is Peter; he lodgeth in the house of"
44,10,33,"Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou hast come. Now therefore we are all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee from God."
44,10,34,"Then Peter opened"
44,10,35,"But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him."
44,10,36,"The word which"
44,10,37,"That word,"
44,10,38,"That God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him."
44,10,39,"And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:"
44,10,40,"Him God raised the third day, and showed him openly;"
44,10,41,"Not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God,"
44,10,42,"And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he who was ordained by God"
44,10,43,"To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins."
44,10,44,"While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them who heard the word."
44,10,45,"And they of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit."
44,10,46,"For they heard them speak in tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,"
44,10,47,"Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?"
44,10,48,"And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they requested him to tarry certain days."
44,11,1,"And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God."
44,11,2,"And when Peter had come to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,"
44,11,3,"Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them."
44,11,4,"But Peter went over"
44,11,5,"I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:"
44,11,6,"Upon which when I had fastened my eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air."
44,11,7,"And I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat."
44,11,8,"But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth."
44,11,9,"But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed,"
44,11,10,"And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven."
44,11,11,"And, behold, immediately there were three men already come to the house where I was, sent from Caesarea to me."
44,11,12,"And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house:"
44,11,13,"And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;"
44,11,14,"Who shall tell thee words, by which thou and all thy house shall be saved."
44,11,15,"And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at the beginning."
44,11,16,"Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized in water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit."
44,11,17,"Forasmuch then as God gave them the same gift as"
44,11,18,"When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance to life."
44,11,19,"Now they who were dispersed upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but to the Jews only."
44,11,20,"And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus."
44,11,21,"And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord."
44,11,22,"Then tidings of these things came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch."
44,11,23,"Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would continue with the Lord."
44,11,24,"For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and many people were added to the Lord."
44,11,25,"Then Barnabas departed to Tarsus, to seek Saul:"
44,11,26,"And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch."
44,11,27,"And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch."
44,11,28,"And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be a great famine throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar."
44,11,29,"Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren who dwelt in Judaea:"
44,11,30,"Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul."
44,12,1,"Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth"
44,12,2,"And he killed James the brother of John with the sword."
44,12,3,"And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)"
44,12,4,"And when he had apprehended him, he put"
44,12,5,"Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing by the church to God for him."
44,12,6,"And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison."
44,12,7,"And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon"
44,12,8,"And the angel said to him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith to him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me."
44,12,9,"And he went out, and followed him; and knew not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision."
44,12,10,"When they were past the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leadeth to the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel departed from him."
44,12,11,"And when Peter had come to himself, he said, Now I know with certainty, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and"
44,12,12,"And when he had considered"
44,12,13,"And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maid came to answer, named Rhoda."
44,12,14,"And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the gate."
44,12,15,"And they said to her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then they said, It is his angel."
44,12,16,"But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened"
44,12,17,"But he, beckoning to them with the hand to hold their peace, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go show these things to James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place."
44,12,18,"Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter."
44,12,19,"And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that"
44,12,20,"And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king’s"
44,12,21,"And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration to them."
44,12,22,"And the people gave a shout,"
44,12,23,"And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten by worms, and died."
44,12,24,"But the word of God grew and multiplied."
44,12,25,"And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled"
44,13,1,"Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul."
44,13,2,"As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
44,13,3,"And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid"
44,13,4,"So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, departed to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus."
44,13,5,"And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as"
44,13,6,"And when they had gone through the isle to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name"
44,13,7,"Who was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God."
44,13,8,"But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith."
44,13,9,"Then Saul, (who also"
44,13,10,"And said, O full of all deceit and all mischief,"
44,13,11,"And now, behold, the hand of the Lord"
44,13,12,"Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord."
44,13,13,"Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem."
44,13,14,"But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down."
44,13,15,"And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men, brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on."
44,13,16,"Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with"
44,13,17,"The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm he brought them out of it."
44,13,18,"And about the time of forty years he bore their manners in the wilderness."
44,13,19,"And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land to them by lot."
44,13,20,"And after these things,"
44,13,21,"And afterward they desired a king: and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years."
44,13,22,"And when he had removed him, he raised up to them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the"
44,13,23,"Of this man’s seed hath God according to"
44,13,24,"After John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel."
44,13,25,"And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not"
44,13,26,"Men, brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent."
44,13,27,"For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the words of the prophets which are read every sabbath, they have fulfilled"
44,13,28,"And though they found no cause of death"
44,13,29,"And when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning him, they took"
44,13,30,"But God raised him from the dead:"
44,13,31,"And he was seen many days by them who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people."
44,13,32,"And we declare to you the glad tidings, that the promise which was made to the fathers,"
44,13,33,"God hath fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee."
44,13,34,"And as concerning that he raised him from the dead,"
44,13,35,"Therefore he saith also in another"
44,13,36,"For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, and was laid to his fathers, and saw corruption:"
44,13,37,"But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption."
44,13,38,"Be it known to you therefore, men, brethren, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins:"
44,13,39,"And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses."
44,13,40,"Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken in the prophets;"
44,13,41,"Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall by no means believe, though a man declare it to you."
44,13,42,"And when the Jews had gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath."
44,13,43,"Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God."
44,13,44,"And the next sabbath came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God."
44,13,45,"But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spoke against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming."
44,13,46,"Then Paul and Barnabas became bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you: but seeing ye reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles."
44,13,47,"For so hath the Lord commanded us,"
44,13,48,"And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed."
44,13,49,"And the word of the Lord was proclaimed throughout all the region."
44,13,50,"But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their land."
44,13,51,"But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium."
44,13,52,"And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Spirit."
44,14,1,"And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed."
44,14,2,"But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren."
44,14,3,"A long time therefore they abode speaking boldly in the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands."
44,14,4,"But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles."
44,14,5,"And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use"
44,14,6,"Being aware of"
44,14,7,"And there they preached the gospel."
44,14,8,"And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother’s womb, who had never walked:"
44,14,9,"The same heard Paul speak: who steadfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,"
44,14,10,"Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked."
44,14,11,"And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men."
44,14,12,"And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker."
44,14,13,"Then the priest of Jupiter, who was before their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people."
44,14,14,""
44,14,15,"And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach to you that ye should turn from these vanities to the living God, who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them:"
44,14,16,"Who in times past allowed all nations to walk in their own ways."
44,14,17,"Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
44,14,18,"And with these sayings they scarce restrained the people, from doing sacrifice to them."
44,14,19,"And there came there"
44,14,20,"But, as the disciples stood around him, he rose, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe."
44,14,21,"And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and"
44,14,22,"Confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."
44,14,23,"And when they had ordained for them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed."
44,14,24,"And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia."
44,14,25,"And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:"
44,14,26,"And from there sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended from to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled."
44,14,27,"And when they had come, and had gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles."
44,14,28,"And there they abode a long time with the disciples."
44,15,1,"And certain men who came down from Judaea taught the brethren,"
44,15,2,"When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, should go to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question."
44,15,3,"And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy to all the brethren."
44,15,4,"And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and"
44,15,5,"But there rose certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command"
44,15,6,"And the apostles and elders came together to consider of this matter."
44,15,7,"And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose, and said to them, Men, brethren, ye know that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe."
44,15,8,"And God, who knoweth the hearts, bore them witness, giving to them the Holy Spirit, even as"
44,15,9,"And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith."
44,15,10,"Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"
44,15,11,"But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they."
44,15,12,"Then all the multitude kept silence, and hearkened to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought by them among the Gentiles."
44,15,13,"And after they held their peace, James answered, saying, Men, brethren, hearken to me:"
44,15,14,"Simeon hath declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles, to take from among them a people for his name."
44,15,15,"And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,"
44,15,16,"After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again its ruins, and I will set it up:"
44,15,17,"That the rest of men may seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things."
44,15,18,"Known to God are all his works from the beginning of the world."
44,15,19,"Therefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them, who from among the Gentiles are turned to God:"
44,15,20,"But that we write to them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and"
44,15,21,"For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath."
44,15,22,"Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas;"
44,15,23,"And they wrote"
44,15,24,"Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying,"
44,15,25,"It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,"
44,15,26,"Men that have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
44,15,27,"We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell"
44,15,28,"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;"
44,15,29,"That ye abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from immorality: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well."
44,15,30,"So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:"
44,15,31,""
44,15,32,"And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed"
44,15,33,"And after they had tarried"
44,15,34,"However it pleased Silas to abide there still."
44,15,35,"Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also."
44,15,36,"And some days after Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord,"
44,15,37,"And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark."
44,15,38,"But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work."
44,15,39,"And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus;"
44,15,40,"And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of God."
44,15,41,"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches."
44,16,1,"Then he came to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain woman, who was a Jewess, and believed; but his father"
44,16,2,"Who was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium."
44,16,3,"Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those quarters: for they all knew that his father was a Greek."
44,16,4,"And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep, that were ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem."
44,16,5,"And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily."
44,16,6,"Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia,"
44,16,7,"After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit allowed them not."
44,16,8,"And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas."
44,16,9,"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, beseeching him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us."
44,16,10,"And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them."
44,16,11,"Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next"
44,16,12,"And from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia,"
44,16,13,"And on the sabbath day we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was accustomed to be made; and we sat down, and spoke to the women who resorted"
44,16,14,"And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard"
44,16,15,"And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought"
44,16,16,"And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain maid possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:"
44,16,17,"The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, who show to us the way of salvation."
44,16,18,"And this she did many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour."
44,16,19,"And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew"
44,16,20,"And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,"
44,16,21,"And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans."
44,16,22,"And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates tore off their clothes, and commanded to beat"
44,16,23,"And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast"
44,16,24,"Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks."
44,16,25,"And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises to God: and the prisoners heard them."
44,16,26,"And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed."
44,16,27,"And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled."
44,16,28,"But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here."
44,16,29,"Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,"
44,16,30,"And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
44,16,31,"And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house."
44,16,32,"And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house."
44,16,33,"And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed"
44,16,34,"And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house."
44,16,35,"And when it was day, the magistrates sent the officers, saying, Let those men go."
44,16,36,"And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace."
44,16,37,"But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast"
44,16,38,"And the officers told these words to the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans."
44,16,39,"And they came and besought them, and brought"
44,16,40,"And they went out of the prison, and entered into"
44,17,1,"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:"
44,17,2,"And Paul, as his manner was, went in to them, and on three sabbaths reasoned with them out of the scriptures,"
44,17,3,"Opening and alleging, that it was needful that Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach to you, is Christ."
44,17,4,"And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few."
44,17,5,"But the Jews who believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain wicked fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city in an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people."
44,17,6,"And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down have come here also;"
44,17,7,"Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king,"
44,17,8,"And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things."
44,17,9,"And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the others, they let them go."
44,17,10,"And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who coming"
44,17,11,"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."
44,17,12,"Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women who were Greeks, and of men, not a few."
44,17,13,"But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also, and stirred up the people."
44,17,14,"And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timothy abode there still."
44,17,15,"And they that conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed."
44,17,16,"Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry."
44,17,17,"Therefore he disputed in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him."
44,17,18,"Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoics, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? some others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached to them Jesus, and the resurrection."
44,17,19,"And they took him, and brought him to Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, of which thou speakest?"
44,17,20,"For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean."
44,17,21,"(For all the Athenians and strangers who were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)"
44,17,22,"Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said,"
44,17,23,"For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I to you."
44,17,24,"God that made the world and all things in it, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;"
44,17,25,"Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;"
44,17,26,"And hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;"
44,17,27,"That they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might grope after him, and find him, though he is not far from every one of us:"
44,17,28,"For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring."
44,17,29,"Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like gold, or silver, or stone, formed by art and man’s device."
44,17,30,"And the times of this ignorance God overlooked; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:"
44,17,31,"Because he hath appointed a day, when he will judge the world in righteousness by"
44,17,32,"And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again concerning this"
44,17,33,"So Paul departed from among them."
44,17,34,"But certain men joined themselves to him, and believed: among whom"
44,18,1,"After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;"
44,18,2,"And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and he came to them."
44,18,3,"And because he was of the same trade, he abode with them, and worked: for by their occupation they were tentmakers."
44,18,4,"And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks."
44,18,5,"And when Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in spirit, and testified to the Jews"
44,18,6,"And when they opposed them, and blasphemed, he shook"
44,18,7,"And he departed from there, and entered into the house of a certain man named Justus,"
44,18,8,"And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized."
44,18,9,"Then the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:"
44,18,10,"For I am with thee, and no man shall lay hands on thee to hurt thee: for I have many people in this city."
44,18,11,"And he continued"
44,18,12,"And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,"
44,18,13,"Saying, This"
44,18,14,"And when Paul was now about to open"
44,18,15,"But if it is a question of words and names, and"
44,18,16,"And he drove them from the judgment seat."
44,18,17,"Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat"
44,18,18,"And Paul"
44,18,19,"And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews."
44,18,20,"When they desired"
44,18,21,"But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return to you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus."
44,18,22,"And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch."
44,18,23,"And after he had spent some time"
44,18,24,"And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man,"
44,18,25,"This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John."
44,18,26,"And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly."
44,18,27,"And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he had come, helped them much who had believed through grace:"
44,18,28,"For he mightily convinced the Jews,"
44,19,1,"And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper regions came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,"
44,19,2,"He said to them, Have ye received the Holy Spirit since ye believed? And they said to him, We have not so much as heard whether there is any Holy Spirit."
44,19,3,"And he said to them, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John’s baptism."
44,19,4,"Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people, that they should believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus."
44,19,5,"When they heard"
44,19,6,"And when Paul had laid"
44,19,7,"And all the men were about twelve."
44,19,8,"And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God."
44,19,9,"But when some were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus."
44,19,10,"And this continued for the space of two years; so that all they who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks."
44,19,11,"And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:"
44,19,12,"So that from his body were brought to the sick, handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them."
44,19,13,"Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth."
44,19,14,"And there were seven sons of"
44,19,15,"And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?"
44,19,16,"And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded."
44,19,17,"And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified."
44,19,18,"And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds."
44,19,19,"Many also of them who practised magic brought their books together, and burned them before all"
44,19,20,"So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed."
44,19,21,"After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
44,19,22,"So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season."
44,19,23,"And the same time there arose no small stir about that way."
44,19,24,"For a certain"
44,19,25,"Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth."
44,19,26,"Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, which are made with hands:"
44,19,27,"So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth."
44,19,28,"And when they heard"
44,19,29,"And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre."
44,19,30,"And when Paul would have entered in to the people, the disciples permitted him not."
44,19,31,"And certain of the chief of Asia, who were his friends, sent to him, beseeching"
44,19,32,"Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the greater part knew not why they had come together."
44,19,33,"And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence to the people."
44,19,34,"But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great"
44,19,35,"And when the townclerk had quieted the people, he said,"
44,19,36,"Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly."
44,19,37,"For ye have brought here these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess."
44,19,38,"Therefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen who are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them accuse one another."
44,19,39,"But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly."
44,19,40,"For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause by which we may give an account of this riotous gathering."
44,19,41,"And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly."
44,20,1,"And after the uproar had ceased, Paul called to"
44,20,2,"And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,"
44,20,3,"And"
44,20,4,"And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus."
44,20,5,"These going before tarried for us at Troas."
44,20,6,"And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days."
44,20,7,"And upon the first"
44,20,8,"And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together."
44,20,9,"And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, having fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell from the third loft, and was taken up dead."
44,20,10,"And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing"
44,20,11,"When he had come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed."
44,20,12,"And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted."
44,20,13,"And we went before to a ship, and sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so he had appointed, intending himself to go on foot."
44,20,14,"And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene."
44,20,15,"And we sailed from there, and came the next"
44,20,16,"For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hastened, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost."
44,20,17,"And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church."
44,20,18,"And when they had come to him, he said to them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,"
44,20,19,"Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and trials, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:"
44,20,20,""
44,20,21,"Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ."
44,20,22,"And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:"
44,20,23,"Except that the Holy Spirit testifieth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me."
44,20,24,"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God."
44,20,25,"And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more."
44,20,26,"Therefore I testify to you this day, that I"
44,20,27,"For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God."
44,20,28,"Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over which the Holy Spirit hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood."
44,20,29,"For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock."
44,20,30,"Also from your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them."
44,20,31,"Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears."
44,20,32,"And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them who are sanctified."
44,20,33,"I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel."
44,20,34,"Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them that were with me."
44,20,35,"I have shown you all things, that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive."
44,20,36,"And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all."
44,20,37,"And they all wept bitterly, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,"
44,20,38,"Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship."
44,21,1,"And it came to pass, that after we were separated from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course to Coos, and the"
44,21,2,"And finding a ship sailing over to Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth."
44,21,3,"Now when we had come in sight of Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unload her cargo."
44,21,4,"And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,5,"And when we had come to the end of those days, we departed and went on our way; and they all accompanied us on our way, with wives and children, till"
44,21,6,"And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again."
44,21,7,"And when we had finished"
44,21,8,"And the next"
44,21,9,"And the same man had four daughters, virgins, who prophesied."
44,21,10,"And as we tarried"
44,21,11,"And when he had come to us, he took Paul’s belt, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this belt, and shall deliver"
44,21,12,"And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,13,"Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,21,14,"And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done."
44,21,15,"And after those days we got ready, and went up to Jerusalem."
44,21,16,"There went with us also"
44,21,17,"And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly."
44,21,18,"And the"
44,21,19,"And when he had greeted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry."
44,21,20,"And when they heard"
44,21,21,"And they are informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise"
44,21,22,"What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come."
44,21,23,"Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men who have a vow on them;"
44,21,24,"Take them and purify thyself with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave"
44,21,25,"As concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written"
44,21,26,"Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until an offering should be offered for every one of them."
44,21,27,"And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews who were from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,"
44,21,28,"Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all"
44,21,29,"(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)"
44,21,30,"And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and immediately the doors were shut."
44,21,31,"And as they went about to kill him, tidings came to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar."
44,21,32,"Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul."
44,21,33,"Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded"
44,21,34,"And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the barracks."
44,21,35,"And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne by the soldiers for the violence of the people."
44,21,36,"For the multitude of the people followed, crying, Away with him."
44,21,37,"And as Paul was to be led into the barracks, he said to the chief captain, May I speak to thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?"
44,21,38,"Art not thou that Egyptian, who before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?"
44,21,39,"But Paul said, I am a man"
44,21,40,"And when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand to the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spoke to"
44,22,1,"Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence"
44,22,2,"(And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)"
44,22,3,"I am verily a man"
44,22,4,"And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women."
44,22,5,"As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the council of the elders: from whom also I received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them who were there bound to Jerusalem, to be punished."
44,22,6,"And it came to pass, that, as I was on my journey, and had come near to Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light around me."
44,22,7,"And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
44,22,8,"And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest."
44,22,9,"And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me."
44,22,10,"And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee concerning all things which are appointed for thee to do."
44,22,11,"And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus."
44,22,12,"And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews who dwelt"
44,22,13,"Came to me, and stood, and said to me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him."
44,22,14,"And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth."
44,22,15,"For thou shalt be his witness to all men of what thou hast seen and heard."
44,22,16,"And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord."
44,22,17,"And it came to pass, that, when I had come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;"
44,22,18,"And saw him saying to me, Make haste, and depart quickly from Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me."
44,22,19,"And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:"
44,22,20,"And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him."
44,22,21,"And he said to me, Depart: for I will send thee far away to the Gentiles."
44,22,22,"And they hearkened to him until this word, and"
44,22,23,"And as they cried out, and cast off"
44,22,24,"The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the barracks, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know for what cause they cried so against him."
44,22,25,"And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?"
44,22,26,"When the centurion heard"
44,22,27,"Then the chief captain came, and said to him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea."
44,22,28,"And the chief captain answered, With a great sum I obtained this freedom. And Paul said, But I was"
44,22,29,"Then immediately they departed from him who were about to examine him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him."
44,22,30,"On the next day, because he would have known the certainty why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him from"
44,23,1,"And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men, brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day."
44,23,2,"And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to strike him on the mouth."
44,23,3,"Then said Paul to him, God shall smite thee,"
44,23,4,"And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?"
44,23,5,"Then said Paul, I knew not, brethren, that he is the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people."
44,23,6,"But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men, brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question."
44,23,7,"And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided."
44,23,8,"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both."
44,23,9,"And there arose a great cry: and the scribes"
44,23,10,"And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring"
44,23,11,"And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified concerning me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear testimony also at Rome."
44,23,12,"And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul."
44,23,13,"And they were more than forty who had made this conspiracy."
44,23,14,"And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul."
44,23,15,"Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down to you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, before he shall come near, are ready to kill him."
44,23,16,"And when the son of Paul’s sister heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the barracks, and told Paul."
44,23,17,"Then Paul called one of the centurions to"
44,23,18,"So he took him, and brought"
44,23,19,"Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went"
44,23,20,"And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat concerning him more perfectly."
44,23,21,"But do not thou yield to them: for there are of them who lie in wait for him more than forty men, who have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now they are ready, looking for a promise from thee."
44,23,22,"So the chief captain"
44,23,23,"And he called to"
44,23,24,"And provide for"
44,23,25,"And he wrote a letter after this manner:"
44,23,26,"Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix"
44,23,27,"This man was taken by the Jews, and should have been killed by them: then I came with a body of soldiers, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman."
44,23,28,"And when I would have known the cause for which they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:"
44,23,29,"Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds."
44,23,30,"And when it was told to me that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent immediately to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what"
44,23,31,"Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought"
44,23,32,"On the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the barracks:"
44,23,33,"Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him."
44,23,34,"And when the governor had read"
44,23,35,"I will hear thee, said he, when thy accusers also have come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall."
44,24,1,"And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and"
44,24,2,"And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse"
44,24,3,"We accept"
44,24,4,"However, that I may not be further tedious to thee, I beseech thee that thou wouldest of thy clemency hear us a few words."
44,24,5,"For we have found this man"
44,24,6,"Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law."
44,24,7,"But the chief captain Lysias came, and with great violence took"
44,24,8,"Commanding his accusers to come to thee: by examining whom thou thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, of which we accuse him."
44,24,9,"And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so."
44,24,10,"Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned to him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been for many years a judge to this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:"
44,24,11,"That thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship."
44,24,12,"And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither provoking the people to sedition, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:"
44,24,13,"Neither can they prove the things of which they now accuse me."
44,24,14,"But this I confess to thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:"
44,24,15,"And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."
44,24,16,"And in this I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and"
44,24,17,"Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings."
44,24,18,"Upon which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult."
44,24,19,"Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had any thing against me."
44,24,20,"Or else let these same"
44,24,21,"Except it is for this one thing, that I cried standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day."
44,24,22,"And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of"
44,24,23,"And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let"
44,24,24,"And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ."
44,24,25,"And as he reasoned of righteousness, self–control, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee."
44,24,26,"He hoped also that money should have been given him by Paul, that he might loose him: therefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him."
44,24,27,"But after two years Porcius Festus came in place of Felix: and Felix, willing to show the Jews a favour, left Paul bound."
44,25,1,"Now when Festus had come into the province, after three days he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem."
44,25,2,"Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,"
44,25,3,"And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him."
44,25,4,"But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly"
44,25,5,"Let them therefore, said he, who among you are able, go down with"
44,25,6,"And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought."
44,25,7,"And when he had come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood around, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove."
44,25,8,"While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I committed any offence."
44,25,9,"But Festus, willing to do the Jews a favour, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go to Jerusalem, and there be judged concerning these things before me?"
44,25,10,"Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest."
44,25,11,"For if I am an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there is none of these things of which these accuse me, no man may deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar."
44,25,12,"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed to Caesar? to Caesar thou shalt go."
44,25,13,"And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus."
44,25,14,"And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause to the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:"
44,25,15,"About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed"
44,25,16,"To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before he who is accused hath the accusers face to face, and hath opportunity to answer for himself concerning the charge laid against him."
44,25,17,"Therefore, when they had come here, without any delay on the next day I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth."
44,25,18,"Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed:"
44,25,19,"But had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive."
44,25,20,"And because I was perplexed concerning such manner of questions, I asked"
44,25,21,"But when Paul had appealed to be reserved to the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar."
44,25,22,"Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him."
44,25,23,"And on the next day, when Agrippa had come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and had entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought forth."
44,25,24,"And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and"
44,25,25,"But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him."
44,25,26,"Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I may have somewhat to write."
44,25,27,"For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not also to signify the charges"
44,26,1,"Then Agrippa said to Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:"
44,26,2,"I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews:"
44,26,3,"Especially"
44,26,4,"My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;"
44,26,5,"Who knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most strict sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee."
44,26,6,"And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers:"
44,26,7,"To which"
44,26,8,"Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?"
44,26,9,"I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
44,26,10,"Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against"
44,26,11,"And I punished them often in every synagogue, and compelled"
44,26,12,"Upon which as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,"
44,26,13,"At noon, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, beyond the brightness of the sun, shining around me and them who journeyed with me."
44,26,14,"And when we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
44,26,15,"And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest."
44,26,16,"But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared to thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of the things which thou hast seen, and of the things in which I will appear to thee;"
44,26,17,"Delivering thee from the people, and"
44,26,18,"To open their eyes,"
44,26,19,"Upon which, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:"
44,26,20,"But showed first to them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judaea, and"
44,26,21,"For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill"
44,26,22,"Having therefore obtained help from God, I continue to this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:"
44,26,23,"That Christ should suffer,"
44,26,24,"And as he was thus speaking for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad."
44,26,25,"But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness."
44,26,26,"For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner."
44,26,27,"King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest."
44,26,28,"Then Agrippa said to Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."
44,26,29,"And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds."
44,26,30,"And when he had thus spoken, the king rose, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:"
44,26,31,"And when they had gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
44,26,32,"Then said Agrippa to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar."
44,27,1,"And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to"
44,27,2,"And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia;"
44,27,3,"And the next"
44,27,4,"And when we had launched from there, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary."
44,27,5,"And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra,"
44,27,6,"And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us on board."
44,27,7,"And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce had come off Cnidus, the wind did not permit us, we sailed under Crete, off Salmone;"
44,27,8,"And, scarcely passing it, came to a place which is called The fair havens; near which was the city"
44,27,9,"Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished"
44,27,10,"And said to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with harm and much damage, not only of the cargo and ship, but also of our lives."
44,27,11,"Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than the things which were spoken by Paul."
44,27,12,"And because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the greater part advised to depart from there also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice,"
44,27,13,"And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained"
44,27,14,"But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon."
44,27,15,"And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let"
44,27,16,"And running under a certain isle which is called Clauda, we had much work to secure the boat:"
44,27,17,"Which when they had taken"
44,27,18,"And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next"
44,27,19,"And the third"
44,27,20,"And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on"
44,27,21,"But after being long without food Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss."
44,27,22,"And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of life among you, but of the ship."
44,27,23,"For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,"
44,27,24,"Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee."
44,27,25,"Therefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told to me."
44,27,26,"But we must be cast upon a certain isle."
44,27,27,"But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen thought that they drew near to some country;"
44,27,28,"And sounded, and found"
44,27,29,"Then fearing lest we should fall upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day."
44,27,30,"And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under pretence as though they would cast anchors out of the foreship,"
44,27,31,"Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved."
44,27,32,"Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off."
44,27,33,"And while the day was coming on, Paul besought"
44,27,34,"Therefore I beseech you to take"
44,27,35,"And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken"
44,27,36,"Then they were all of good cheer, and they also took food."
44,27,37,"And we were in all in the ship two hundred and seventy and six souls."
44,27,38,"And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast the wheat into the sea."
44,27,39,"And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into which they purposed, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship."
44,27,40,"And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed"
44,27,41,"And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the bow stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the stern was broken with the violence of the waves."
44,27,42,"And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape."
44,27,43,"But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from"
44,27,44,"And the rest, some on boards, and some on"
44,28,1,"And when they had escaped, then they knew that the isle was called Melita."
44,28,2,"And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold."
44,28,3,"And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid"
44,28,4,"And when the barbarians saw the"
44,28,5,"And he shook off the creature into the fire, and felt no harm."
44,28,6,"Yet they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god."
44,28,7,"In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the isle, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously."
44,28,8,"And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick with a fever and a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him."
44,28,9,"So when this was done, others also, who had diseases in the isle, came, and were healed:"
44,28,10,"Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they supplied"
44,28,11,"And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux."
44,28,12,"And landing at Syracuse, we tarried"
44,28,13,"And from there we sailed around, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:"
44,28,14,"Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome."
44,28,15,"And from there, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage."
44,28,16,"And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him."
44,28,17,"And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called together the chief of the Jews: and when they were assembled, he said to them, Men, brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans."
44,28,18,"Who, when they had examined me, would have let"
44,28,19,"But when the Jews spoke against"
44,28,20,"For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see"
44,28,21,"And they said to him, We have neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, neither have any of the brethren that came shown or spoken any harm of thee."
44,28,22,"But we desire to hear from thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against."
44,28,23,"And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into"
44,28,24,"And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not."
44,28,25,"And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after Paul had spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Spirit by Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,"
44,28,26,"Saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:"
44,28,27,"For the heart of this people has become dull, and their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with"
44,28,28,"Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it."
44,28,29,"And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great dispute among themselves."
44,28,30,"And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in to him,"
44,28,31,"Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him."
45,1,1,"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called"
45,1,2,"(Which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)"
45,1,3,"Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh;"
45,1,4,"And declared"
45,1,5,"By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:"
45,1,6,"Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:"
45,1,7,"To all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called"
45,1,8,"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world."
45,1,9,"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;"
45,1,10,"Making request, if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you."
45,1,11,"For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end"
45,1,12,"That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me."
45,1,13,"Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come to you, (but was hindered until now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles."
45,1,14,"I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise."
45,1,15,"So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also."
45,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."
45,1,17,"For in this is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith."
45,1,18,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;"
45,1,19,"Because that which may be known of God is evident in them; for God hath shown"
45,1,20,"For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,"
45,1,21,"Because that, when they knew God, they glorified"
45,1,22,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,"
45,1,23,"And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, and birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things."
45,1,24,"Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:"
45,1,25,"Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen."
45,1,26,"For this cause God gave them up to vile affections: for even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature:"
45,1,27,"And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was due."
45,1,28,"And even as they did not like to retain God in"
45,1,29,"Being filled with all unrighteousness, immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers,"
45,1,30,"Backbiters, haters of God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,"
45,1,31,"Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:"
45,1,32,"Who knowing the judgment of God, that they who commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them."
45,2,1,"Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whoever thou art that judgest: for in that thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things."
45,2,2,"But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them who commit such things."
45,2,3,"And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?"
45,2,4,"Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?"
45,2,5,"But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up to thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;"
45,2,6,"Who will render to every man according to his deeds:"
45,2,7,"To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:"
45,2,8,"But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,"
45,2,9,"Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;"
45,2,10,"But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:"
45,2,11,"For there is no respect of persons with God."
45,2,12,"For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;"
45,2,13,"(For not the hearers of the law"
45,2,14,"For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:"
45,2,15,"Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and"
45,2,16,"In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel."
45,2,17,"But if, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,"
45,2,18,"And knowest"
45,2,19,"And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them who are in darkness,"
45,2,20,"An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, who hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law."
45,2,21,"Thou therefore who teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?"
45,2,22,"Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?"
45,2,23,"Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?"
45,2,24,"For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written."
45,2,25,"For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keepest the law: but if thou art a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision."
45,2,26,"Therefore if the uncircumcision keepeth the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?"
45,2,27,"And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it keepeth the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?"
45,2,28,"For he is not a Jew, who is one outwardly; neither"
45,2,29,"But he"
45,3,1,"What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit"
45,3,2,"Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God."
45,3,3,"For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faithfulness of God without effect?"
45,3,4,"By no means: verily, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy sayings, and mayest overcome when thou art judged."
45,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say?"
45,3,6,"By no means: for then how shall God judge the world?"
45,3,7,"For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?"
45,3,8,"And not"
45,3,9,"What then? are we better"
45,3,10,"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"
45,3,11,"There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh God."
45,3,12,"They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one."
45,3,13,"Their throat"
45,3,14,"Whose mouth"
45,3,15,"Their feet"
45,3,16,"Destruction and misery"
45,3,17,"And the way of peace have they not known:"
45,3,18,"There is no fear of God before their eyes."
45,3,19,"Now we know that whatever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God."
45,3,20,"Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law"
45,3,21,"But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;"
45,3,22,"Even the righteousness of God"
45,3,23,"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"
45,3,24,"Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ:"
45,3,25,"Whom God hath set forth"
45,3,26,"To declare,"
45,3,27,"Where"
45,3,28,"Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law."
45,3,29,""
45,3,30,"Seeing"
45,3,31,"Do we then make void the law through faith? By no means: but, we establish the law."
45,4,1,"What shall we then say that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?"
45,4,2,"For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath"
45,4,3,"For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness."
45,4,4,"Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt."
45,4,5,"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness."
45,4,6,"Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, to whom God imputeth righteousness apart from works,"

45,4,10,"How then was it reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision."
45,4,11,"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which"
45,4,12,"And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which"
45,4,13,"For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world,"
45,4,14,"For if they who are of the law"
45,4,15,"Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is,"
45,4,16,"Therefore"
45,4,17,"(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed,"
45,4,18,"Who against hope believed with hope, that he should become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be."
45,4,19,"And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb:"
45,4,20,"He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;"
45,4,21,"And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform."
45,4,22,"And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness."
45,4,23,"Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;"
45,4,24,"But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead;"
45,4,25,"Who was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification."
45,5,1,"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:"
45,5,2,"By whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
45,5,3,"And not only"
45,5,4,"And patience, experience; and experience, hope:"
45,5,5,"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given to us."
45,5,6,"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly."
45,5,7,"For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die."
45,5,8,"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
45,5,9,"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."
45,5,10,"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life."
45,5,11,"And not only"
45,5,12,"Therefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:"
45,5,13,"(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law."
45,5,14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come."
45,5,15,"But not as the offence, so also"
45,5,16,"And not as"
45,5,17,"For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)"
45,5,18,"Therefore as by the offence of one"
45,5,19,"For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous."
45,5,20,"Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:"
45,5,21,"That as sin hath reigned to death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,6,1,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"
45,6,2,"By no means. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer in it?"
45,6,3,"Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?"
45,6,4,"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
45,6,5,"For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also"
45,6,6,"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with"
45,6,7,"For he that is dead is freed from sin."
45,6,8,"Now if we are dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:"
45,6,9,"Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him."
45,6,10,"For in that he died, he died to sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth to God."
45,6,11,"Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,6,12,"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in its lusts."
45,6,13,"Neither yield ye your members"
45,6,14,"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace."
45,6,15,"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? By no means."
45,6,16,"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants in obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?"
45,6,17,"But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you."
45,6,18,"Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness."
45,6,19,"I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity to"
45,6,20,"For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness."
45,6,21,"What fruit had ye then in those things of which ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things"
45,6,22,"But now being made free from sin, and having become servants to God, ye have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life."
45,6,23,"For the wages of sin"
45,7,1,"Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?"
45,7,2,"For the woman who hath an husband is bound by the law to"
45,7,3,"So then if, while"
45,7,4,"Therefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another,"
45,7,5,"For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit to death."
45,7,6,"But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead by which we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not"
45,7,7,"What shall we say then?"
45,7,8,"But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of lust. For apart from the law sin"
45,7,9,"For I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."
45,7,10,"And the commandment, which"
45,7,11,"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew"
45,7,12,"Therefore the law"
45,7,13,"Was then that which is good made death to me? By no means. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful."
45,7,14,"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."
45,7,15,"For that which I do I understand not: for what I would, that I do not; but what I hate, that I do."
45,7,16,"If then I do that which I would not, I consent to the law that"
45,7,17,"Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
45,7,18,"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but"
45,7,19,"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do."
45,7,20,"Now if I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
45,7,21,"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me."
45,7,22,"For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:"
45,7,23,"But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."
45,7,24,"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
45,7,25,"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin."
45,8,1,""
45,8,2,"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death."
45,8,3,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:"
45,8,4,"That the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit."
45,8,5,"For they that are according to the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are according to the Spirit the things of the Spirit."
45,8,6,"For to be carnally minded"
45,8,7,"Because the carnal mind"
45,8,8,"So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God."
45,8,9,"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. Now if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his."
45,8,10,"And if Christ"
45,8,11,"But if the Spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised Christ from the dead shall also give life to your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you."
45,8,12,"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh."
45,8,13,"For if ye live according to the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live."
45,8,14,"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."
45,8,15,"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father."
45,8,16,"The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:"
45,8,17,"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint–heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with"
45,8,18,"For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time"
45,8,19,"For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God."
45,8,20,"For the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected"
45,8,21,"Because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God."
45,8,22,"For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now."
45,8,23,"And not only"
45,8,24,"For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?"
45,8,25,"But if we hope for what we see not,"
45,8,26,"Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."
45,8,27,"And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what"
45,8,28,"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to"
45,8,29,"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate"
45,8,30,"Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified."
45,8,31,"What shall we then say to these things? If God"
45,8,32,"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"
45,8,33,"Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect?"
45,8,34,"Who"
45,8,35,"What shall separate us from the love of Christ?"
45,8,36,"As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter."
45,8,37,"But, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us."
45,8,38,"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,"
45,8,39,"Nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
45,9,1,"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit,"
45,9,2,"That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart."
45,9,3,"For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:"
45,9,4,"Who are Israelites; to whom"
45,9,5,"Whose"
45,9,6,"Not as though the word of God hath taken no effect. For they"

45,9,14,"What shall we say then?"
45,9,15,"For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
45,9,16,"So then"

45,9,19,"Thou wilt say then to me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?"

45,9,26,"And it shall come to pass,"

45,9,28,"For he will finish the work, and cut"
45,9,29,"And as Isaiah said before, Except the Lord of Hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and been made like Gomorrah."
45,9,30,"What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith."
45,9,31,"But Israel, who followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness."
45,9,32,"Why? Because"
45,9,33,"As it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
45,10,1,"Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they may be saved."
45,10,2,"For I bear them witness that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge."
45,10,3,"For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God."
45,10,4,"For Christ"
45,10,5,"For Moses describeth the righteousness which is by the law, That the man who doeth those things shall live by them."
45,10,6,"But the righteousness which is by faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:)"
45,10,7,"Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring Christ again from the dead.)"
45,10,8,"But what saith it? The word is near thee,"
45,10,9,"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thy heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."
45,10,10,"For with the heart man believeth to righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made to salvation."
45,10,11,"For the scripture saith, Whoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
45,10,12,"For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich to all that call upon him."
45,10,13,"For whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
45,10,14,"How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?"
45,10,15,"And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!"
45,10,16,"But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?"
45,10,17,"So then faith"
45,10,18,"But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world."
45,10,19,"But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by"
45,10,20,"But Isaiah is very bold, and saith, I was found by them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them that asked not for me."
45,10,21,"But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and contrary people."
45,11,1,"I say then, Hath God cast away his people? By no means. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham,"
45,11,2,"God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,"
45,11,3,"Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and torn down thy altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."
45,11,4,"But what saith the answer of God to him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal."
45,11,5,"Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace."
45,11,6,"And if by grace, then"
45,11,7,"What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded"

45,11,10,"Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always."
45,11,11,"I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? By no means: but"

45,11,19,"Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in."
45,11,20,"Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:"

45,14,13,"Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in"
45,14,14,"I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that"
45,14,15,"But if thy brother is grieved with"
45,14,16,"Let not then your good be evil spoken of:"
45,14,17,"For the kingdom of God is not food and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit."
45,14,18,"For he that in these things serveth Christ"
45,14,19,"Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things which one may edify another."
45,14,20,"For the sake of food destroy not the work of God. All things indeed"
45,14,21,""
45,14,22,"Hast thou faith? have"
45,14,23,"And he that doubteth is condemned if he eateth, because"
45,15,1,"We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves."
45,15,2,"Let every one of us please"
45,15,3,"For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me."
45,15,4,"For whatever things were written in former times were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope."
45,15,5,"Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:"
45,15,6,"That ye may with one mind"
45,15,7,"Therefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God."
45,15,8,"Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises"
45,15,9,"And that the Gentiles might glorify God for"
45,15,10,"And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people."
45,15,11,"And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people."
45,15,12,"And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust."
45,15,13,"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit."
45,15,14,"And I myself also am persuaded concerning you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another."
45,15,15,"Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly to you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me from God,"
45,15,16,"That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
45,15,17,"I have therefore cause for glorying through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God."
45,15,18,"For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,"
45,15,19,"Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and all around to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ."
45,15,20,"And, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation:"
45,15,21,"But as it is written, They shall see to whom he was not spoken of: and they that have not heard shall understand."
45,15,22,"For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you."
45,15,23,"But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;"
45,15,24,"Whenever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way there by you, if first I shall be somewhat filled with your"
45,15,25,"But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints."
45,15,26,"For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who are at Jerusalem."
45,15,27,"It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things."
45,15,28,"When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go by you into Spain."
45,15,29,"And I am sure that, when I come to you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ."
45,15,30,"Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in"
45,15,31,"That I may be delivered from them in Judaea who do not believe; and that my service which"
45,15,32,"That I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed."
45,15,33,"Now the God of peace"
45,16,1,"I commend to you Phebe our sister, who is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:"
45,16,2,"That ye receive her in the Lord, as it becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a helper of many, and of myself also."
45,16,3,"Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:"
45,16,4,"Who have for my life laid down their own necks: to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles."
45,16,5,"Likewise"
45,16,6,"Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us."
45,16,7,"Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me."
45,16,8,"Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord."
45,16,9,"Greet Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved."
45,16,10,"Greet Apelles approved in Christ. Greet them who are of Aristobulus’"
45,16,11,"Greet Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that are of the"
45,16,12,"Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Greet the beloved Persis, who laboured much in the Lord."
45,16,13,"Greet Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine."
45,16,14,"Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren who are with them."
45,16,15,"Greet Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them."
45,16,16,"Greet one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ greet you."
45,16,17,"Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them who cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them."
45,16,18,"For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own body; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the innocent."
45,16,19,"For your obedience is come abroad to all"
45,16,20,"And the God of peace shall soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ"
45,16,21,"Timothy my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, greet you."
45,16,22,"I Tertius, who wrote"
45,16,23,"Gaius my host, and of the whole church, greeteth you. Erastus the treasurer of the city greeteth you, and Quartus a brother."
45,16,24,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ"
45,16,25,"Now to him that is able to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which hath been kept secret since the world began,"
45,16,26,"But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:"
45,16,27,"To God the only wise,"
46,1,1,"Paul, called"
46,1,2,"To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called"
46,1,3,"Grace"
46,1,4,"I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;"
46,1,5,"That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and"
46,1,6,"Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:"
46,1,7,"So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
46,1,8,"Who shall also confirm you to the end,"
46,1,9,"God"
46,1,10,"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and"
46,1,11,"For it hath been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by them"
46,1,12,"Now this I say, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ."
46,1,13,"Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?"
46,1,14,"I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;"
46,1,15,"Lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name."
46,1,16,"And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other."
46,1,17,"For Christ hath not sent me to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect."
46,1,18,"For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us who are saved it is the power of God."
46,1,19,"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
46,1,20,"Where"
46,1,21,"For when in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."
46,1,22,"For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek wisdom:"
46,1,23,"But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumblingblock, and to the Greeks foolishness;"
46,1,24,"But to them who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
46,1,25,"Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
46,1,26,"For ye see your calling, brethren, that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble,"
46,1,27,"But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;"
46,1,28,"And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:"
46,1,29,"That no flesh should glory in his presence."
46,1,30,"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who from God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:"
46,1,31,"That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
46,2,1,"And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God."
46,2,2,"For I determined not to know any thing among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
46,2,3,"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling."
46,2,4,"And my speech and my preaching"
46,2,5,"That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
46,2,6,"However we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:"
46,2,7,"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,"
46,2,8,"Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known"
46,2,9,"But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him."
46,2,10,"But God hath revealed"
46,2,11,"For what man knoweth the things of a man, except the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God."
46,2,12,"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God; that we may know the things that are freely given to us by God."
46,2,13,"Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Spirit teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
46,2,14,"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know"
46,2,15,"But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged by no man."
46,2,16,"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."
46,3,1,"And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal,"
46,3,2,"I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for until now ye were not able"
46,3,3,"For ye are yet carnal: for though"
46,3,4,"For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I"
46,3,5,"Who then is Paul, and who"
46,3,6,"I have planted, Apollos watered; but God hath given the increase."
46,3,7,"So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase."
46,3,8,"Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour."
46,3,9,"For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s field,"
46,3,10,"According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth upon it. But let every man take heed how he buildeth upon it."
46,3,11,"For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
46,3,12,"Now if any man buildeth upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;"
46,3,13,"Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is."
46,3,14,"If any man’s work abideth which he hath built upon it, he shall receive a reward."
46,3,15,"If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire."
46,3,16,"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and"
46,3,17,"If any man defileth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which"
46,3,18,"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise."
46,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness."
46,3,20,"And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain."
46,3,21,"Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;"
46,3,22,"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;"
46,3,23,"And ye are Christ’s; and Christ"
46,4,1,"Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God."
46,4,2,"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful."
46,4,3,"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by man’s judgment: yea, I judge not my own self."
46,4,4,"For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord."
46,4,5,"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord shall come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will reveal the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise from God."
46,4,6,"And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and"
46,4,7,"For who maketh thee to differ"
46,4,8,"Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I wish ye did reign, that we also might reign with you."
46,4,9,"For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men."
46,4,10,"We"
46,4,11,"Even to this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;"
46,4,12,"And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure it:"
46,4,13,"Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things to this day."
46,4,14,"I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn"
46,4,15,"For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet"
46,4,16,"Therefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me."
46,4,17,"For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, as I teach every where in every church."
46,4,18,"Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you."
46,4,19,"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them who are puffed up, but the power."
46,4,20,"For the kingdom of God"
46,4,21,"What will ye? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and"
46,5,1,"It is reported commonly"
46,5,2,"And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who hath done this deed might be taken away from among you."
46,5,3,"For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present,"
46,5,4,"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
46,5,5,"To deliver such one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
46,5,6,"Your boasting"
46,5,7,"Therefore purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:"
46,5,8,"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened"
46,5,9,"I wrote to you in my epistle not to associate with immoral people:"
46,5,10,"Yet not altogether with immoral people of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then ye must needs go out of the world."
46,5,11,"But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a person no not to eat."
46,5,12,"For what have I to do to judge them also that are outside"
46,5,13,"But them that are outside God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person."
46,6,1,"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?"
46,6,2,"Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"
46,6,3,"Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?"
46,6,4,"If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church."
46,6,5,"I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?"
46,6,6,"But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers."
46,6,7,"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather"
46,6,8,"But, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that"
46,6,9,"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,"
46,6,10,"Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God."
46,6,11,"And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."
46,6,12,"All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any."
46,6,13,"Food"
46,6,14,"And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power."
46,6,15,"Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make"
46,6,16,"What? know ye not that he who is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh."
46,6,17,"But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit."
46,6,18,"Flee immorality. Every sin that a man doeth is outside the body; but he that committeth immorality sinneth against his own body."
46,6,19,"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit"
46,6,20,"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s."
46,7,1,"Now concerning the things of which ye wrote to me:"
46,7,2,"Nevertheless,"
46,7,3,"Let the husband render to the wife her due benevolence: and likewise also the wife to the husband."
46,7,4,"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife."
46,7,5,"Defraud ye not one the other, except"
46,7,6,"But I speak this by permission,"
46,7,7,"For I would that all men were as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that."
46,7,8,"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I."
46,7,9,"But if they cannot control themselves, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."
46,7,10,"And to the married I command,"
46,7,11,"But if she shall depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to"
46,7,12,"But to the rest I speak, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she is pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away."
46,7,13,"And the woman who hath an husband that believeth not, and if he is pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him."
46,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy."
46,7,15,"But if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such"
46,7,16,"For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save"
46,7,17,"But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all churches."
46,7,18,"Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not become circumcised."
46,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."
46,7,20,"Let every man remain in the same calling in which he was called."
46,7,21,"Art thou called"
46,7,22,"For he that is called in the Lord,"
46,7,23,"Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men."
46,7,24,"Brethren, let every man,"
46,7,25,"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy from the Lord to be faithful."
46,7,26,"I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress,"
46,7,27,"Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife."
46,7,28,"But if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you."
46,7,29,"But this I say, brethren, the time"
46,7,30,"And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;"
46,7,31,"And they that use this world, as not abusing"
46,7,32,"But I would have you without care. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:"
46,7,33,"But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please"
46,7,34,"There is a difference"
46,7,35,"And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction."
46,7,36,"But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin, if she hath passed the flower of"
46,7,37,"Nevertheless he that standeth steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well."
46,7,38,"So then he that giveth"
46,7,39,"The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband is dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord."
46,7,40,"But she is happier if she so remain, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God."
46,8,1,"Now as concerning things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth."
46,8,2,"And if any man thinketh that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know."
46,8,3,"But if any man loveth God, the same is known by him."
46,8,4,"Therefore as concerning the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol"
46,8,5,"For though there are that are called gods, whether in heaven or upon earth, (as there are gods many, and lords many,)"
46,8,6,"Yet to us"
46,8,7,"But"
46,8,8,"But food commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse."
46,8,9,"But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours should become a stumblingblock to them that are weak."
46,8,10,"For if any man shall see thee who hast knowledge sit eating in the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;"
46,8,11,"And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?"
46,8,12,"But when ye thus sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ."
46,8,13,"Therefore, if food maketh my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to stumble."
46,9,1,"Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are ye not my work in the Lord?"
46,9,2,"If I am not an apostle to others, yet doubtless I am to you: for ye are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."
46,9,3,"My answer to them that examine me is this,"
46,9,4,"Have we no right to eat and to drink?"
46,9,5,"Have we no right to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and"
46,9,6,"Or I only and Barnabas, have we no right to forbear working?"
46,9,7,"Who goeth to war at any time at his own expense? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of its fruit? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?"
46,9,8,"Do I say these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?"
46,9,9,"For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the grain. Doth God take care for oxen?"
46,9,10,"Or saith he"
46,9,11,"If we have sown to you spiritual things,"
46,9,12,"If others are partakers of"
46,9,13,"Do ye not know that they who minister about holy things live"
46,9,14,"Even so hath the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel should live by the gospel."
46,9,15,"But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for"
46,9,16,"For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of: for necessity is laid upon me; and, woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!"
46,9,17,"For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation"
46,9,18,"What is my reward then?"
46,9,19,"For though I am free from all"
46,9,20,"And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;"
46,9,21,"To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law."
46,9,22,"To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak: I have become all things to all"
46,9,23,"And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I may be a partaker of it with"
46,9,24,"Know ye not that they who run in a race all run, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain."
46,9,25,"And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they"
46,9,26,"I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so I fight, not as one that beateth the air:"
46,9,27,"But I keep under my body, and bring"
46,10,1,"Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;"
46,10,2,"And were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea;"
46,10,3,"And all ate the same spiritual food;"
46,10,4,"And all drank the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ."
46,10,5,"But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness."
46,10,6,"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted."
46,10,7,"Neither be ye idolaters, as"
46,10,8,"Neither let us commit immorality, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand."
46,10,9,"Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents."
46,10,10,"Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer."
46,10,11,"Now all these things happened to them for examples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come."
46,10,12,"Therefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall."
46,10,13,"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God"
46,10,14,"Therefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry."
46,10,15,"I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say."
46,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?"
46,10,17,"For we"
46,10,18,"Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?"
46,10,19,"What then do I say? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?"
46,10,20,"But I"
46,10,21,"Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of demons."
46,10,22,"Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?"
46,10,23,"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not."
46,10,24,"Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s"
46,10,25,"Whatever is sold in the meat market,"
46,10,26,"For the earth"
46,10,27,"If any of them that believe not bid you"
46,10,28,"But if any man shall say to you, This is offered in sacrifice to idols, eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth"
46,10,29,"Conscience, I say, not thy own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged by another"
46,10,30,"For if I by grace am a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?"
46,10,31,"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God."
46,10,32,"Give no offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:"
46,10,33,"Even as I please all"
46,11,1,"Be ye followers of me, even as I also"
46,11,2,"Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered"
46,11,3,"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman"
46,11,4,"Every man praying or prophesying, having"
46,11,5,"But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with"
46,11,6,"For if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered."
46,11,7,"For a man indeed ought not to cover"
46,11,8,"For the man is not from the woman; but the woman from the man."
46,11,9,"Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man."
46,11,10,"For this cause ought the woman to have authority on"
46,11,11,"Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord."
46,11,12,"For as the woman"
46,11,13,"Judge in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman should pray to God uncovered?"
46,11,14,"Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man hath long hair, it is a shame to him?"
46,11,15,"But if a woman hath long hair, it is a glory to her: for"
46,11,16,"But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God."
46,11,17,"Now in this that I declare"
46,11,18,"For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it."
46,11,19,"For there must be also heresies among you, that they who are approved may be become evident among you."
46,11,20,"When therefore ye come together in one place,"
46,11,21,"For in eating every one taketh before"
46,11,22,"What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise"
46,11,23,"For I have received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus the"
46,11,24,"And when he had given thanks, he broke"
46,11,25,"After the same manner also"
46,11,26,"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord’s death till he shall come."
46,11,27,"Therefore whoever shall eat this bread, and drink"
46,11,28,"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of"
46,11,29,"For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body."
46,11,30,"For this cause many"
46,11,31,"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged."
46,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world."
46,11,33,"Therefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another."
46,11,34,"And if any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that ye come not together to judgment. And the rest will I set in order when I come."
46,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual"
46,12,2,"Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, even as ye were led."
46,12,3,"Therefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and"
46,12,4,"Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit."
46,12,5,"And there are varieties of administrations, but the same Lord."
46,12,6,"And there are varieties of operations, but it is the same God who worketh all in all."
46,12,7,"But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man for profit of all."
46,12,8,"For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;"
46,12,9,"To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;"
46,12,10,"To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another"
46,12,11,"But all these worketh that one and the very same Spirit, dividing to every man individually as he will."
46,12,12,"For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also"
46,12,13,"For by one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit."
46,12,14,"For the body is not one member, but many."
46,12,15,"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
46,12,16,"And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
46,12,17,"If the whole body"
46,12,18,"But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him."
46,12,19,"And if they were all one member, where"
46,12,20,"But now"
46,12,21,"And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."
46,12,22,"Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:"
46,12,23,"And those"
46,12,24,"For our comely"
46,12,25,"That there should be no schism in the body; but"
46,12,26,"And if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honoured, all the members rejoice with it."
46,12,27,"Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular."
46,12,28,"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments,"
46,12,29,""
46,12,30,"Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?"
46,12,31,"But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet I show to you a more excellent way."
46,13,1,"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become"
46,13,2,"And though I have"
46,13,3,"And though I bestow all my goods to feed"
46,13,4,"Charity suffereth long,"
46,13,5,"Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;"
46,13,6,"Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;"
46,13,7,"Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."
46,13,8,"Charity never faileth: but whether"
46,13,9,"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part."
46,13,10,"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away."
46,13,11,"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."
46,13,12,"For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."
46,13,13,"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these"
46,14,1,"Follow after charity, and desire spiritual"
46,14,2,"For he that speaketh in an"
46,14,3,"But he that prophesieth speaketh to men"
46,14,4,"He that speaketh in an"
46,14,5,"I would that ye all spoke with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater"
46,14,6,"Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?"
46,14,7,"And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?"
46,14,8,"For if the trumpet shall give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for battle?"
46,14,9,"So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air."
46,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them"
46,14,11,"Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh"
46,14,12,"Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual"
46,14,13,"Therefore let him that speaketh in an"
46,14,14,"For if I pray in an"
46,14,15,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also."
46,14,16,"Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the place of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?"
46,14,17,"For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified."
46,14,18,"I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:"
46,14,19,"Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that"
46,14,20,"Brethren, be not children in understanding: yet in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men."
46,14,21,"In the law it is written, With"

46,14,25,"And thus are the secrets of his heart made known; and so falling down on"
46,14,26,"How is it then, brethren? when ye are assembled, each one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification."
46,14,27,"If any man speaketh in an"
46,14,28,"But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God."
46,14,29,"Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the others judge."
46,14,30,"If"
46,14,31,"For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted."
46,14,32,"And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets."
46,14,33,"For God is not"
46,14,34,"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but"
46,14,35,"And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church."
46,14,36,"What? came the word of God out from you? or came it to you only?"
46,14,37,"If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord."
46,14,38,"But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant."
46,14,39,"Therefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues."
46,14,40,"Let all things be done decently and in order."
46,15,1,"Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also ye have received, and in which ye stand;"
46,15,2,"By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached to you, unless ye have believed in vain."
46,15,3,"For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;"
46,15,4,"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:"
46,15,5,"And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve:"
46,15,6,"After that, he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some have fallen asleep."
46,15,7,"After that, he was seen by James; then by all the apostles."
46,15,8,"And last of all he was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time."
46,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
46,15,10,"But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which"
46,15,11,"Therefore whether"
46,15,12,"Now if Christ is preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
46,15,13,"But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:"
46,15,14,"And if Christ is not risen, then"
46,15,15,"And indeed, we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified concerning God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not, if in fact the dead rise not."
46,15,16,"For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:"
46,15,17,"And if Christ is not raised, your faith"
46,15,18,"Then they also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished."
46,15,19,"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable."
46,15,20,"But now is Christ risen from the dead,"
46,15,21,"For since by man"
46,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
46,15,23,"But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming."
46,15,24,"Then"
46,15,25,"For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet."
46,15,26,"The last enemy"
46,15,27,"For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under"
46,15,28,"And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all."
46,15,29,"Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?"
46,15,30,"And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?"
46,15,31,"I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."
46,15,32,"If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die."
46,15,33,"Be not deceived: evil company corrupteth good habits."

46,15,44,"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."
46,15,45,"And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam"

46,15,52,"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."
46,15,53,"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal"
46,15,54,"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."

46,16,6,"And it may be that I will abide, and even winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey wherever I go."
46,16,7,"For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit."
46,16,8,"But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost."

47,1,16,"And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again from Macedonia to you, and by you to be brought on my way toward Judaea."
47,1,17,"When I therefore was thus minded, did I do it lightly? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?"
47,1,18,"But"
47,1,19,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us,"
47,1,20,"For all the promises of God in him"
47,1,21,"Now he who establisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us,"
47,1,22,"Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."
47,1,23,"Moreover I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I have not as yet come to Corinth."
47,1,24,"Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand."
47,2,1,"But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness."
47,2,2,"For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same who is made sorry by me?"
47,2,3,"And I wrote this same to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them by whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is"
47,2,4,"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly to you."
47,2,5,"But if any hath caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not burden you all."
47,2,6,"Sufficient to such a man"
47,2,7,"So that on the contrary ye"
47,2,8,"Therefore I beseech you that ye would confirm"
47,2,9,"For to this end also I wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things."
47,2,10,"To whom ye forgive any thing, I"
47,2,11,"Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices."
47,2,12,"Furthermore, when I came to Troas to"
47,2,13,"I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia."
47,2,14,"Now thanks"
47,2,15,"For we are to God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:"
47,2,16,"To the one"
47,2,17,"For we are not as many, who corrupt the word of God: but as from sincerity, but as from God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ."
47,3,1,"Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some"
47,3,2,"Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read by all men:"
47,3,3,""
47,3,4,"And such trust we have through Christ toward God:"
47,3,5,"Not that we are sufficient by ourselves to think any thing as from ourselves; but our sufficiency"
47,3,6,"Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life."
47,3,7,"But if the ministration of death, written"
47,3,8,"How shall not the ministration of the Spirit be more glorious?"
47,3,9,"For if the ministration of condemnation"
47,3,10,"For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth."
47,3,11,"For if that which was done away"
47,3,12,"Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:"
47,3,13,"And not as Moses,"
47,3,14,"But their minds were blinded: for until this day the same veil remaineth untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which"
47,3,15,"But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart."
47,3,16,"Nevertheless when one shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away."
47,3,17,"Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord"
47,3,18,"But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory,"
47,4,1,"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;"
47,4,2,"But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God."
47,4,3,"But if our gospel is hid, it is hid to them that are lost:"
47,4,4,"In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them who believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them."
47,4,5,"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake."
47,4,6,"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shone into our hearts, to"
47,4,7,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not from us."
47,4,8,""
47,4,9,"Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;"
47,4,10,"Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our body."
47,4,11,"For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh."
47,4,12,"So then death worketh in us, but life in you."
47,4,13,"We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;"
47,4,14,"Knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus shall raise us also by Jesus, and shall present"
47,4,15,"For all things"
47,4,16,"For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward"
47,4,17,"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding"
47,4,18,"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen"

47,5,3,"If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked."

47,5,6,"Therefore"
47,5,7,"(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)"
47,5,8,"We are confident,"
47,5,9,"Therefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted by him."
47,5,10,"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things"
47,5,11,"Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences."
47,5,12,"For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to"
47,5,13,"For whether we are beside ourselves,"
47,5,14,"For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:"

47,5,16,"Therefore henceforth we know no man according to the flesh: though indeed, we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now henceforth we know"
47,5,17,"Therefore if any man"
47,5,18,"And all things"
47,5,19,"That is, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them; and hath committed to us the word of reconciliation."
47,5,20,"Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech"
47,5,21,"For he hath made him"
47,6,1,"We then,"
47,6,2,"(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I helped thee: behold, now"
47,6,3,"Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:"
47,6,4,"But in all"
47,6,5,"In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;"
47,6,6,"By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love,"
47,6,7,"By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,"
47,6,8,"By honour and dishonour, by bad report and good report: as deceivers, and"
47,6,9,"As unknown, and"
47,6,10,"As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and"

47,6,13,"Now in return for the same, (I speak as to"
47,6,14,"Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?"
47,6,15,"And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?"
47,6,16,"And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in"

47,7,5,"For, when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without"
47,7,6,"Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;"
47,7,7,"And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more."
47,7,8,"For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though"
47,7,9,"Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might suffer loss through us in nothing."
47,7,10,"For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death."
47,7,11,"For behold this very same thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what diligence it wrought in you, yea,"
47,7,12,"Therefore, though I wrote to you,"
47,7,13,"Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: and exceedingly the more we rejoiced for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all."
47,7,14,"For if I have boasted any thing to him concerning you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which"
47,7,15,"And his affection is more abundant toward you, while he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him."
47,7,16,"I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all"
47,8,1,"Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;"
47,8,2,"That in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality."
47,8,3,"For to"
47,8,4,"Begging us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and"
47,8,5,"And"
47,8,6,"So that we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also."
47,8,7,"Therefore, as ye abound in every"
47,8,8,"I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the diligence of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love."
47,8,9,"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich."
47,8,10,"And in this I give"

47,8,17,"For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more diligent, of his own accord he went to you."
47,8,18,"And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise"
47,8,19,"And not"
47,8,20,"Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:"
47,8,21,"Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men."
47,8,22,"And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved to be diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which"
47,8,23,"If"
47,8,24,"Therefore show ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf."
47,9,1,"For as concerning the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:"
47,9,2,"For I know the readiness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath stirred up very many."
47,9,3,"Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:"
47,9,4,"Lest if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting."
47,9,5,"Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before to you, and make up beforehand your bounty, of which ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as"
47,9,6,"But this"
47,9,7,"Every man according as he purposeth in his heart,"

47,9,10,"Now may he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for"
47,9,11,"Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God."
47,9,12,"For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God;"
47,9,13,"While by the proof of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for"
47,9,14,"And by their prayer for you, who long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you."
47,9,15,"Thanks"
47,10,1,"Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence"
47,10,2,"But I beseech"
47,10,3,"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh:"
47,10,4,"(For the weapons of our warfare"
47,10,5,"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;"
47,10,6,"And having in a readiness to punish all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled."
47,10,7,"Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trusteth to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he"
47,10,8,"For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:"
47,10,9,"That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters."
47,10,10,"For"
47,10,11,"Let such a person think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such"
47,10,12,"For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise."
47,10,13,"But we will not boast of things without"
47,10,14,"For we stretch not ourselves beyond"
47,10,15,"Not boasting of things without"
47,10,16,"To preach the gospel in the"
47,10,17,"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
47,10,18,"For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth."
47,11,1,"O that ye could bear with me a little in"
47,11,2,"For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present"
47,11,3,"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his craftiness, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."
47,11,4,"For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or"
47,11,5,"For I suppose I was not a bit behind the very greatest apostles."
47,11,6,"But though"
47,11,7,"Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God without charge?"
47,11,8,"I robbed other churches, taking wages"
47,11,9,"And when I was present with you, and in need, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied: and in all"
47,11,10,"As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia."
47,11,11,"Why? because I love you not? God knoweth."
47,11,12,"But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them who desire occasion; that in what they glory, they may be found even as we."
47,11,13,"For such"
47,11,14,"And no wonder; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light."
47,11,15,"Therefore"
47,11,16,"I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little."
47,11,17,"That which I speak, I speak"
47,11,18,"Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also."
47,11,19,"For ye bear with fools gladly, seeing ye"
47,11,20,"For ye bear with it, if a man bringeth you into bondage, if a man devoureth"
47,11,21,"I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. But in whatever respect any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also."
47,11,22,"Are they Hebrews? so"
47,11,23,"Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I"
47,11,24,"From the Jews five times I received forty"
47,11,25,"Three times was I beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;"
47,11,26,""
47,11,27,"In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness."
47,11,28,"Besides those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches."
47,11,29,"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is led into sin, and I am not incensed?"
47,11,30,"If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities."
47,11,31,"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not."
47,11,32,"In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:"
47,11,33,"And through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall, and escaped his hands."
47,12,1,"It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord."
47,12,2,"I knew a man in Christ fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such one caught up to the third heaven."
47,12,3,"And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)"
47,12,4,"How he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."
47,12,5,"Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in my infirmities."
47,12,6,"For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but"
47,12,7,"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure."
47,12,8,"For this thing I besought the Lord three times, that it might depart from me."
47,12,9,"And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me."
47,12,10,"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong."
47,12,11,"I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended by you: for in nothing am I behind the very greatest apostles, though I am nothing."
47,12,12,"Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds."
47,12,13,"For what is it in which ye were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong."
47,12,14,"Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children."
47,12,15,"And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved."
47,12,16,"But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile."
47,12,17,"Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?"
47,12,18,"I urged Titus, and with"
47,12,19,"Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves to you? we speak before God in Christ: but"
47,12,20,"For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and"
47,12,21,""
47,13,1,"This"
47,13,2,"I told you before, and foretell, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them who have sinned before, and to all others, that, if I come again, I will not spare:"
47,13,3,"Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who toward you is not weak, but is mighty in you."
47,13,4,"For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you."
47,13,5,"Examine yourselves, whether ye are in the faith; test your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye are disqualified?"
47,13,6,"But I trust that ye shall know that we are not disqualified."
47,13,7,"Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we may seem disqualified."
47,13,8,"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."
47,13,9,"For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish,"
47,13,10,"Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction."
47,13,11,"Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you."
47,13,12,"Greet one another with an holy kiss."
47,13,13,"All the saints greet you."
47,13,14,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit,"
48,1,1,"Paul, an apostle, (not from men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)"
48,1,2,"And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:"
48,1,3,"Grace"
48,1,4,"Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:"
48,1,5,"To whom"
48,1,6,"I marvel that ye are so soon turning from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:"
48,1,7,"Which is not another; but there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ."
48,1,8,"But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed."
48,1,9,"As we said before, so I say now again, If any"
48,1,10,"For do I now seek the favour of men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ."
48,1,11,"But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man."
48,1,12,"For I neither received it from man, neither was I taught"
48,1,13,"For ye have heard of my former manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:"
48,1,14,"And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers."
48,1,15,"But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called"
48,1,16,"To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:"
48,1,17,"Neither did I go to Jerusalem to them who were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus."
48,1,18,"Then after three years I went to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days."
48,1,19,"But I saw no other of the apostles, except James the Lord’s brother."
48,1,20,"Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not."
48,1,21,"Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;"
48,1,22,"And was unknown by face to the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:"
48,1,23,"But they had heard only, That he who persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed."
48,1,24,"And they glorified God in me."
48,2,1,"Then fourteen years after I went again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with"
48,2,2,"And I went by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them who were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain."
48,2,3,"But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:"
48,2,4,"And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in secretly to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:"
48,2,5,"To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you."
48,2,6,"But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they who seemed"
48,2,7,"But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to me, as"
48,2,8,"(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)"
48,2,9,"And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we"
48,2,10,"Only"
48,2,11,"But when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed."
48,2,12,"For before that certain came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles: but when they had come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision."
48,2,13,"And the other Jews likewise were hypocrites with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their hypocrisy."
48,2,14,"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before"
48,2,15,"We"
48,2,16,"Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."
48,2,17,"But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners,"
48,2,18,"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor."
48,2,19,"For I through the law am dead to the law, that I may live to God."
48,2,20,"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."
48,2,21,"I do not set aside the grace of God: for if righteousness is"
48,3,1,"O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been clearly set forth, crucified among you?"
48,3,2,"This only would I learn from you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
48,3,3,"Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?"
48,3,4,"Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if"
48,3,5,"He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you,"
48,3,6,"Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."
48,3,7,"Know ye therefore that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham."
48,3,8,"And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, preached before the gospel to Abraham,"
48,3,9,"So then they who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham."
48,3,10,"For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed"
48,3,11,"But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God,"
48,3,12,"And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live by them."
48,3,13,"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed"
48,3,14,"That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."
48,3,15,"Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though"
48,3,16,"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."
48,3,17,"And this I say,"
48,3,18,"For if the inheritance"
48,3,19,"What purpose then"
48,3,20,"Now a mediator is not"
48,3,21,""
48,3,22,"But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe."
48,3,23,"But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up to the faith which should afterwards be revealed."
48,3,24,"Therefore the law was our schoolmaster"
48,3,25,"But after faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."
48,3,26,"For ye are all children of God by faith in Christ Jesus."
48,3,27,"For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ."
48,3,28,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."
48,3,29,"And if ye"
48,4,1,"Now I say,"
48,4,2,"But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father."
48,4,3,"Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:"
48,4,4,"But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,"
48,4,5,"To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons."
48,4,6,"And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father."
48,4,7,"Therefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."
48,4,8,"However then, when ye knew not God, ye did service to them which by nature are no gods."
48,4,9,"But now, after ye have known God, or rather are known by God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which ye desire again to be in bondage?"
48,4,10,"Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years."
48,4,11,"I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain."
48,4,12,"Brethren, I beseech you, be as I"
48,4,13,"Ye know that in infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first."
48,4,14,"And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God,"
48,4,15,"What then was the blessedness ye spoke of? for I bear you witness, that, if"
48,4,16,"Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?"
48,4,17,"They zealously seek you,"
48,4,18,"But"
48,4,19,"My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,"
48,4,20,"I desire to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I stand in doubt of you."
48,4,21,"Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?"
48,4,22,"For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman."
48,4,23,"But he"
48,4,24,"Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which beareth children for bondage, which is Hagar."
48,4,25,"For this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children."
48,4,26,"But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all."
48,4,27,"For it is written, Rejoice,"
48,4,28,"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise."
48,4,29,"But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him"
48,4,30,"Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman."
48,4,31,"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free."
48,5,1,"Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."
48,5,2,"Behold, I Paul say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing."
48,5,3,"For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law."
48,5,4,"Christ is become of no effect to you, whoever of you are justified by the law; ye have fallen from grace."
48,5,5,"For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith."
48,5,6,"For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love."
48,5,7,"Ye did run well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?"
48,5,8,"This persuasion"
48,5,9,"A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump."
48,5,10,"I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be not otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whoever he may be."
48,5,11,"And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then hath the offence of the cross ceased."
48,5,12,"I would they were even cut off who trouble you."
48,5,13,"For, brethren, ye have been called to liberty; only"
48,5,14,"For all the law is fulfilled in one word,"
48,5,15,"But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one by another."
48,5,16,""
48,5,17,"For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would."
48,5,18,"But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law."
48,5,19,"Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are"
48,5,20,"Idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousy, wrath, contention, seditions, heresies,"
48,5,21,"Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of which I tell you before, as I have also told"
48,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,"
48,5,23,"Meekness, self–control: against such there is no law."
48,5,24,"And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts."
48,5,25,"If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."
48,5,26,"Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another."
48,6,1,"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye who are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted."
48,6,2,"Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ."
48,6,3,"For if a man thinketh himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself."
48,6,4,"But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another."
48,6,5,"For every man shall bear his own burden."
48,6,6,"Let him that is taught in the word share with him that teacheth in all good things."
48,6,7,"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."
48,6,8,"For he that soweth to his flesh shall from the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall from the Spirit reap life everlasting."
48,6,9,"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."
48,6,10,"As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all"
48,6,11,"Ye see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand."
48,6,12,"As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ."
48,6,13,"For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh."
48,6,14,"But may it never be that I should glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world."
48,6,15,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation."
48,6,16,"And as many as walk according to this rule, peace"
48,6,17,"From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus."

49,2,16,"And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having by himself slain the enmity:"
49,2,17,"And came and preached peace to you who were afar off, and to them that were near."

49,6,13,"Therefore take up the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
49,6,14,"Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;"
49,6,15,"And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;"
49,6,16,"Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which ye shall be able to put out all the fiery darts of the wicked."
49,6,17,"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:"
49,6,18,"Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching for this purpose with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;"
49,6,19,"And for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,"
49,6,20,"For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak."
49,6,21,"But that ye also may know my affairs,"
49,6,22,"Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that ye may know our affairs, and"
49,6,23,"Peace"
49,6,24,"Grace"
50,1,1,"Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:"
50,1,2,"Grace"
50,1,3,"I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,"
50,1,4,"Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,"
50,1,5,"For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;"
50,1,6,"Being confident of this very thing, that he who hath begun a good work in you will perform"
50,1,7,"Even as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace."
50,1,8,"For God is my witness, how greatly I long after you all in the affection of Jesus Christ."
50,1,9,"And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and"
50,1,10,"That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;"
50,1,11,"Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God."
50,1,12,"But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things"
50,1,13,"So that my bonds in Christ are known in all the palace, and in all other"
50,1,14,"And many of the brethren in the Lord, being more confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear."
50,1,15,"Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife; and some also from good will:"
50,1,16,"The one preach Christ from contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:"
50,1,17,"But the other from love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel."
50,1,18,"What then? Only"
50,1,19,"For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,"
50,1,20,"According to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but"
50,1,21,"For me to live"
50,1,22,"But if I live in the flesh, this"
50,1,23,"For I am in a strait between the two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:"
50,1,24,"Nevertheless to abide in the flesh"
50,1,25,"And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;"
50,1,26,"That your rejoicing for me may be more abundant in Jesus Christ by my coming to you again."
50,1,27,"Only let your conduct be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;"
50,1,28,"And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that from God."
50,1,29,"For to you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;"
50,1,30,"Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear"
50,2,1,"If"
50,2,2,"Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love,"
50,2,3,""
50,2,4,"Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others."
50,2,5,"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:"
50,2,6,"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:"
50,2,7,"But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:"
50,2,8,"And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross."
50,2,9,"Therefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:"
50,2,10,"That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of"
50,2,11,"And"
50,2,12,"Therefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
50,2,13,"For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do of"
50,2,14,"Do all things without murmurings and disputings:"
50,2,15,"That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;"
50,2,16,"Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain."
50,2,17,"Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all."
50,2,18,"For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me."
50,2,19,"But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly to you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state."
50,2,20,"For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state."
50,2,21,"For all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ."
50,2,22,"But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel."
50,2,23,"Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me."
50,2,24,"But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly."
50,2,25,"Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants."
50,2,26,"For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because ye had heard that he was sick."
50,2,27,"For indeed he was sick near to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow."
50,2,28,"I sent him therefore the more eagerly, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful."
50,2,29,"Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:"
50,2,30,"Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, to supply the want of your service toward me."
50,3,1,"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed"
50,3,2,"Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the false circumcision."
50,3,3,"For we are the"
50,3,4,"Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath reason to trust in the flesh, I more:"
50,3,5,"Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel,"
50,3,6,"Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; with respect to the righteousness which is by the law, blameless."
50,3,7,"But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ."
50,3,8,"Yea doubtless, and I count all things"
50,3,9,"And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith:"
50,3,10,"That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;"
50,3,11,"If by any means I may attain to the resurrection of the dead."
50,3,12,"Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I press on, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended by Christ Jesus."
50,3,13,"Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but"
50,3,14,"I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
50,3,15,"Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye are otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you."
50,3,16,"Nevertheless, to what we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing."
50,3,17,"Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them who walk even as ye have us for an example."
50,3,18,"(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping,"
50,3,19,"Whose end"
50,3,20,"For our citizenship is in heaven; from which also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:"
50,3,21,"Who shall change our lowly body, that it may be fashioned like his glorious body, according to the working by which he is able even to subdue all things to himself."
50,4,1,"Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord,"
50,4,2,"I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord."
50,4,3,"And I entreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women who laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and"
50,4,4,"Rejoice in the Lord always:"
50,4,5,"Let your moderation be known to all men. The Lord"
50,4,6,"Be anxious for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God."
50,4,7,"And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."
50,4,8,"Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things"
50,4,9,"Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you."
50,4,10,"But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; in which ye were also concerned, but ye lacked opportunity."
50,4,11,"Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatever state I am,"
50,4,12,"I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need."
50,4,13,"I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me."
50,4,14,"However ye have done well, that ye did share with my affliction."
50,4,15,"Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only."
50,4,16,"For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again to my necessity."
50,4,17,"Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account."
50,4,18,"But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received from Epaphroditus the things"
50,4,19,"But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus."
50,4,20,"Now to God and our Father"
50,4,21,"Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you."
50,4,22,"All the saints greet you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household."
50,4,23,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ"
51,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy"
51,1,2,"To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colosse: Grace"
51,1,3,"We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,"
51,1,4,"Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love"
51,1,5,"For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, of which ye have heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;"
51,1,6,"Which is come to you, as"
51,1,7,"As ye also learned from Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;"
51,1,8,"Who also declared to us your love in the Spirit."
51,1,9,"For this cause we also, since the day we heard"
51,1,10,"That ye may walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;"
51,1,11,"Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, to all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;"
51,1,12,"Giving thanks to the Father, who hath made us qualified to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:"
51,1,13,"Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated"
51,1,14,"In whom we have redemption through his blood,"
51,1,15,"Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation:"
51,1,16,"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are upon earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:"
51,1,17,"And he is before all things, and by him all things consist."
51,1,18,"And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all"
51,1,19,"For it pleased"
51,1,20,"And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him,"
51,1,21,"And you, that were once alienated and enemies in"

51,1,23,"If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and"
51,1,24,"Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church:"
51,1,25,"Of which I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;"
51,1,26,""
51,1,27,"To whom God would make known what"
51,1,28,"Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:"
51,1,29,"For which I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily."
51,2,1,"For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and"
51,2,2,"That their hearts may be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;"
51,2,3,"In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."
51,2,4,"And this I say, lest any man should deceive you with enticing words."
51,2,5,"For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ."
51,2,6,"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord,"
51,2,7,"Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving."
51,2,8,"Beware lest any man make a prey of you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ."
51,2,9,"For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily."
51,2,10,"And ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and power:"
51,2,11,"In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:"
51,2,12,"Buried with him in baptism, in which also ye are risen with"
51,2,13,"And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he made alive together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;"
51,2,14,"Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;"
51,2,15,""
51,2,16,"Let no man therefore judge you in food, or in drink, or in respect of a feast day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbaths:"
51,2,17,"Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body"
51,2,18,"Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,"
51,2,19,"And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God."
51,2,20,"Therefore if ye are dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,"
51,2,21,"(Touch not; taste not; handle not;"
51,2,22,"Which all are to perish with the using;) according to the commandments and doctrines of men?"
51,2,23,"These things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh."
51,3,1,"If ye then were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God."
51,3,2,"Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."
51,3,3,"For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God."
51,3,4,"When Christ,"
51,3,5,"Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; immorality, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry:"
51,3,6,"For which things’ the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:"
51,3,7,"In which ye also walked once, when ye lived with them."

51,3,12,"Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, tender mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;"
51,3,13,"Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man hath a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also"
51,3,14,"And above all these things"
51,3,15,"And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful."
51,3,16,"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord."
51,3,17,"And whatever ye do in word or deed,"
51,3,18,"Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord."
51,3,19,"Husbands, love"

51,4,18,"The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace"
52,1,1,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians"
52,1,2,"We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;"
52,1,3,"Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;"
52,1,4,"Knowing, brethren beloved, your election by God."
52,1,5,"For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake."
52,1,6,"And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit:"
52,1,7,"So that ye were examples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia."
52,1,8,"For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing."
52,1,9,"For they themselves show of us what manner of entrance we had to you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;"
52,1,10,"And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead,"
52,2,1,"For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance to you, that it was not in vain:"
52,2,2,"But even after we had suffered before, and were shamefully treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention."
52,2,3,"For our exhortation"
52,2,4,"But as we were allowed by God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who trieth our hearts."
52,2,5,"For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God"
52,2,6,"Nor from men sought we glory, neither from you, nor"
52,2,7,"But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:"
52,2,8,"So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear to us."
52,2,9,"For ye remember, brethren, our labour and toil: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God."
52,2,10,"Ye"
52,2,11,"As ye know how we exhorted and encouraged and charged each one of you, as a father"
52,2,12,"That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you into his kingdom and glory."
52,2,13,"For this cause also we thank God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard from us, ye received"
52,2,14,"For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things from your own countrymen, even as they"
52,2,15,"Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:"
52,2,16,"Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost."
52,2,17,"But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire."
52,2,18,"Therefore we would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us."
52,2,19,"For what"
52,2,20,"For ye are our glory and joy."
52,3,1,"Therefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;"
52,3,2,"And sent Timothy, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:"
52,3,3,"That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed to this."
52,3,4,"For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know."
52,3,5,"For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter may have tempted you, and our labour be in vain."
52,3,6,"But now when Timothy came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also"
52,3,7,"Therefore, brethren, by your faith we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress:"
52,3,8,"For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord."
52,3,9,"For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God;"
52,3,10,"Night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?"
52,3,11,"Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you."
52,3,12,"And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all"
52,3,13,"To the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints."
52,4,1,"Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort"
52,4,2,"For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus."
52,4,3,"For this is the will of God,"
52,4,4,"That each one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;"
52,4,5,"Not in the lust of passion, even as the Gentiles who know not God:"
52,4,6,"That no"
52,4,7,"For God hath not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness."
52,4,8,"He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given to us his Holy Spirit."
52,4,9,"But concerning brotherly love ye need not that I write to you: for ye yourselves are taught by God to love one another."
52,4,10,"And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;"
52,4,11,"And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;"
52,4,12,"That ye may walk honestly toward them that are outside"
52,4,13,"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them who are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others who have no hope."
52,4,14,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also who sleep in Jesus will God bring with him."
52,4,15,"For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive"
52,4,16,"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:"
52,4,17,"Then we who are alive"
52,4,18,"Therefore comfort one another with these words."
52,5,1,"But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write to you."
52,5,2,"For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night."
52,5,3,"For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape."
52,5,4,"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief."
52,5,5,"Ye are all children of light, and children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness."
52,5,6,"Therefore let us not sleep, as"
52,5,7,"For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that get drunk are drunk in the night."
52,5,8,"But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation."
52,5,9,"For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,"
52,5,10,"Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him."
52,5,11,"Therefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do."
52,5,12,"And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;"
52,5,13,"And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake."
52,5,14,"Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all"
52,5,15,"See that none render evil for evil to any"
52,5,16,"Rejoice evermore."
52,5,17,"Pray without ceasing."
52,5,18,"In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you."
52,5,19,"Quench not the Spirit."
52,5,20,"Despise not prophesyings."
52,5,21,"Examine all things; hold fast that which is good."
52,5,22,"Abstain from all appearance of evil."
52,5,23,"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and"
52,5,24,"Faithful"
52,5,25,"Brethren, pray for us."
52,5,26,"Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss."
52,5,27,"I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren."
52,5,28,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ"
53,1,1,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
53,1,2,"Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,1,3,"We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is befitting, because your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of each one of you all toward each other aboundeth;"
53,1,4,"So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:"
53,1,5,""
53,1,6,"Seeing"
53,1,7,"And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,"
53,1,8,"In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
53,1,9,"Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"
53,1,10,"When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired by all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day."
53,1,11,"Therefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of"
53,1,12,"That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,1,"Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and"
53,2,2,"That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ has come."
53,2,3,"Let no man deceive you by any means: for"
53,2,4,"Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God."
53,2,5,"Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?"
53,2,6,"And now ye know what restraineth that he might be revealed in his time."
53,2,7,"For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now restraineth"
53,2,8,"And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:"
53,2,9,""
53,2,10,"And with all deception of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved."
53,2,11,"And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:"
53,2,12,"That they all may be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
53,2,13,"But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:"
53,2,14,"To which he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,15,"Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle."
53,2,16,"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, who hath loved us, and hath given"
53,2,17,"Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work."
53,3,1,"Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have"
53,3,2,"And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all"
53,3,3,"But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep"
53,3,4,"And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you."
53,3,5,"And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ."
53,3,6,"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received from us."
53,3,7,"For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;"
53,3,8,"Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nothing; but wrought with labour and toil night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:"
53,3,9,"Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an example to you to follow us."
53,3,10,"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."
53,3,11,"For we hear that there are some who walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies."
53,3,12,"Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread."
53,3,13,"But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing."
53,3,14,"And if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed."
53,3,15,"Yet count"
53,3,16,"Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord"
53,3,17,"The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write."

54,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ,"
54,1,2,"To Timothy,"
54,1,3,"As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,"
54,1,4,"Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith:"
54,1,5,"Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and"
54,1,6,"From which some having swerved have turned aside to vain talking;"
54,1,7,"Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor concerning what they affirm."
54,1,8,"But we know that the law"
54,1,9,"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"
54,1,10,"For immoral men, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;"
54,1,11,"According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust."
54,1,12,"And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;"
54,1,13,"Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and an insolent man: but I obtained mercy, because I did"
54,1,14,"And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
54,1,15,"This"
54,1,16,"However for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them who should believe on him to life everlasting."
54,1,17,"Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, God the only wise,"
54,1,18,"This charge I commit to thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies made before concerning thee, that thou by them mayest war a good warfare;"
54,1,19,"Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:"
54,1,20,"Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."
54,2,1,"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions,"
54,2,2,"For kings, and"
54,2,3,"For this"
54,2,4,"Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth."
54,2,5,"For"
54,2,6,"Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time."
54,2,7,"For which I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ,"
54,2,8,"I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting."
54,2,9,"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with reverence and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;"
54,2,10,"But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works."
54,2,11,"Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection."
54,2,12,"But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."
54,2,13,"For Adam was first formed, then Eve."
54,2,14,"And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression."
54,2,15,"However she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety."
54,3,1,"This"
54,3,2,"A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober minded, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;"
54,3,3,"Not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;"
54,3,4,"One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;"
54,3,5,"(For if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)"
54,3,6,"Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil."
54,3,7,"Moreover he must have a good report of them who are outside"
54,3,8,"Likewise"
54,3,9,"Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience."
54,3,10,"And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being"
54,3,11,"Even so"
54,3,12,"Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well."
54,3,13,"For they that have used the office of a deacon well, purchase to themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus."
54,3,14,"These things I write to thee, hoping to come to thee shortly:"
54,3,15,"But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
54,3,16,"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was revealed in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory."
54,4,1,"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of demons;"
54,4,2,"Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;"
54,4,3,"Forbidding to marry,"
54,4,4,"For every creature of God"
54,4,5,"For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer."
54,4,6,"If thou shalt put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished by the words of faith and of good doctrine, to which thou hast attained."
54,4,7,"But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself"
54,4,8,"For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."
54,4,9,"This"
54,4,10,"For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of those that believe."
54,4,11,"These things command and teach."
54,4,12,"Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conduct, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."
54,4,13,"Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine."
54,4,14,"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery."
54,4,15,"Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all."
54,4,16,"Take heed to thyself, and to thy doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee."
54,5,1,"Rebuke not an elder, but exhort"
54,5,2,"The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity."
54,5,3,"Honour widows that are widows indeed."
54,5,4,"But if any widow hath children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to repay their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God."
54,5,5,"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day."
54,5,6,"But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth."
54,5,7,"And these things command, that they may be blameless."
54,5,8,"But if any provideth not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel."
54,5,9,"Let not a widow be taken into the number under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,"
54,5,10,"Well reported of for good works; if she hath brought up children, if she hath lodged strangers, if she hath washed the saints’ feet, if she hath relieved the afflicted, if she hath diligently followed every good work."
54,5,11,"But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to grow wanton against Christ, they will marry;"
54,5,12,"Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith."
54,5,13,"And at the same time they learn"
54,5,14,"I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, rule the house, give no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully."
54,5,15,"For some are already turned aside after Satan."
54,5,16,"If any man or woman that believeth hath widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed."
54,5,17,"Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine."
54,5,18,"For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the grain. And, The labourer"
54,5,19,"Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses."
54,5,20,"Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear."
54,5,21,"I charge"
54,5,22,"Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure."
54,5,23,"Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thy frequent infirmities."
54,5,24,"Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some"
54,5,25,"Likewise also the good works"

54,6,2,"And they that have believing masters, let them not despise"
54,6,3,"If any man teacheth otherwise, and agreeth not to wholesome words,"
54,6,4,"He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, from which cometh envy, strife, railings, evil suspicions,"
54,6,5,"Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing gain to be godliness: from such withdraw thyself."
54,6,6,"But godliness with contentment is great gain."
54,6,7,"For we brought nothing into"
54,6,8,"And having food and raiment with these let us be content."
54,6,9,"But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and"
54,6,10,"For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some have coveted, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
54,6,11,"But thou, O man of God, flee from these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness."
54,6,12,"Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses."
54,6,13,"I command thee in the sight of God, who maketh alive all things, and"
54,6,14,"That thou keep"

54,6,18,"That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to share;"
54,6,19,"Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life."

58,2,14,"Since then the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;"

58,3,16,"For some, when they had heard, did provoke: yet not all that came out of Egypt by Moses."
58,3,17,"But with whom was he grieved forty years?"
58,3,18,"And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?"

58,4,7,"Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."
58,4,8,"For if Joshua had given them rest, then he would not afterward have spoken of another day."
58,4,9,"There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God."
58,4,10,"For he that hath entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God"

58,4,13,"Neither is there any creature that is hidden in his sight: but all things"
58,4,14,"Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast"

58,5,4,"And no man taketh this honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as"
58,5,5,"So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said to him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee."
58,5,6,"As he saith also in another"
58,5,7,"Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;"
58,5,8,"Though he was a Son, yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered;"
58,5,9,"And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him;"
58,5,10,"Called by God an high priest after the order of Melchizedek."
58,5,11,"Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing."
58,5,12,"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need of one to teach you again which"

58,6,11,"And we desire each one of you to show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end:"
58,6,12,"That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
58,6,13,"For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,"
58,6,14,"Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee."
58,6,15,"And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise."
58,6,16,"For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation"
58,6,17,"In the same way God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed"
58,6,18,"That by two immutable things, in which"
58,6,19,"Which"
58,6,20,"Where the forerunner hath for us entered,"
58,7,1,"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;"
58,7,2,"To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;"

58,7,6,"But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises."
58,7,7,"And without any dispute the less is blessed by the better."
58,7,8,"And here men that die receive tithes; but there he"
58,7,9,"And as I may say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham."

58,7,11,"If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need"
58,7,12,"For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law."
58,7,13,"For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar."
58,7,14,"For"
58,7,15,"And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest,"
58,7,16,"Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life."
58,7,17,"For he testifieth, Thou"
58,7,18,"For there is verily a setting aside of the former commandment on account of its weakness and unprofitableness."
58,7,19,"For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope"
58,7,20,"And inasmuch as not without an oath"
58,7,21,"(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said to him, The Lord swore and will not repent, Thou"
58,7,22,"By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament."
58,7,23,"And they truly were many priests, because they were not allowed to continue by reason of death:"
58,7,24,"But this"
58,7,25,"Therefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them."
58,7,26,"For such an high priest was befitting for us,"
58,7,27,"Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself."
58,7,28,"For the law maketh men high priests who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law,"
58,8,1,"Now of the things which we have spoken"
58,8,2,"A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man."

58,8,4,"For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:"
58,8,5,"Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished by God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he,"
58,8,6,"But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises."
58,8,7,"For if that first"
58,8,8,"For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:"
58,8,9,"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord."
58,8,10,"For this"
58,8,11,"And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest."
58,8,12,"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."

58,9,5,"And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly."
58,9,6,"Now when these things were thus prepared, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service"
58,9,7,"But into the second"
58,9,8,"The Holy Spirit thus signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet revealed, while the first tabernacle was yet standing:"
58,9,9,"Which"

58,9,12,"Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption"
58,9,13,"For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctify to the purifying of the flesh:"
58,9,14,"How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
58,9,15,"And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions"
58,9,16,"For where a testament"
58,9,17,"For a testament"
58,9,18,"Hence even the first"
58,9,19,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,"
58,9,20,"Saying, This"
58,9,21,"Moreover he sprinkled likewise with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry."
58,9,22,"And almost all things are by the law cleansed with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission."
58,9,23,""
58,9,24,"For Christ hath not entered into the holy places made with hands,"
58,9,25,"Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;"
58,9,26,"For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself."
58,9,27,"And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:"
58,9,28,"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him he shall appear the second time without sin to salvation."
58,10,1,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come,"
58,10,2,"For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once cleansed should have had no more conscience of sins."
58,10,3,"But in those"
58,10,4,"For"

58,10,27,"But a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."
58,10,28,"He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:"
58,10,29,"Of how much more severe punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, by which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite to the Spirit of grace?"
58,10,30,"For we know him that hath said, Vengeance"

58,10,32,"But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;"
58,10,33,"Partly, while ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, while ye became companions of them that were so used."
58,10,34,"For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the plundering of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance."
58,10,35,"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward."
58,10,36,"For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye may receive the promise."

58,11,4,"By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh."
58,11,5,"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God."
58,11,6,"But without faith"
58,11,7,"By faith Noah, being warned by God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith."
58,11,8,"By faith Abraham, when he was called to move into a place which he should later receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing where he was going."
58,11,9,"By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as"

58,11,23,"By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw"
58,11,24,"By faith Moses, when he had come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;"
58,11,25,"Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;"
58,11,26,"Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect to the recompence of the reward."

58,11,31,"By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, after she had received the spies with peace."
58,11,32,"And what more shall I say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and"
58,11,33,"Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,"

58,12,6,"For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth."
58,12,7,"If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?"
58,12,8,"But if ye are without chastisement, of which all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons."

59,2,4,"Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?"
59,2,5,"Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?"
59,2,6,"But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?"
59,2,7,"Do they not blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?"
59,2,8,"If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:"
59,2,9,"But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors."
59,2,10,"For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one"
59,2,11,"For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou committest no adultery, yet if thou killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law."

59,2,19,"Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and tremble."
59,2,20,"But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?"
59,2,21,"Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?"
59,2,22,"Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?"
59,2,23,"And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God."
59,2,24,"Ye see then that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only."
59,2,25,"Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent"
59,2,26,"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."
59,3,1,"My brethren, be not many teachers, knowing that we shall receive the greater judgment."
59,3,2,"For in many things we all offend. If any man stumble not in word, the same"
59,3,3,"Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body."
59,3,4,"Behold also the ships, which though"
59,3,5,"Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!"
59,3,6,"And the tongue"
59,3,7,"For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of creatures in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind:"
59,3,8,"But the tongue can no man tame;"
59,3,9,"With it we bless God, even the Father; and with it we curse men, who are made after the similitude of God."
59,3,10,"Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be."
59,3,11,"Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet"

59,4,4,"Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God."
59,4,5,"Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?"
59,4,6,"But he giveth more grace. Therefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble."
59,4,7,"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."

59,5,8,"Be ye also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth near."
59,5,9,"Murmur not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door."
59,5,10,"Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience."
59,5,11,"Behold, we count them happy who endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy."
59,5,12,"But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and"
59,5,13,"Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any cheerful? let him sing psalms."
59,5,14,"Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:"

59,5,18,"And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit."
59,5,19,"Brethren, if any one of you should err from the truth, and one should convert him;"

60,2,8,"And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence,"
60,2,9,"But ye"
60,2,10,"Who in time past"
60,2,11,"Dearly beloved, I beseech"
60,2,12,"Having your behaviour honest among the Gentiles: that, though they speak against you as evildoers, they may by"
60,2,13,"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether to the king, as supreme;"
60,2,14,"Or to governors, as to them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well."
60,2,15,"For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:"
60,2,16,"As free, and not using"
60,2,17,"Honour all"
60,2,18,"Servants,"
60,2,19,"For this"
60,2,20,"For what glory"
60,2,21,"For even to this were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:"
60,2,22,"Who committed no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:"
60,2,23,"Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed"
60,2,24,"Who himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed."
60,2,25,"For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls."
60,3,1,"Likewise, ye wives,"
60,3,2,"While they behold your chaste behaviour"
60,3,3,"Whose adorning let it not be that outward"
60,3,4,"But"
60,3,5,"For after this manner in former times the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:"
60,3,6,"Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any terror."
60,3,7,"Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with"
60,3,8,"Finally,"
60,3,9,"Not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling: but on the contrary blessing; knowing that ye are called to this, that ye should inherit a blessing."
60,3,10,"For he that will love life, and see good days, let him restrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:"
60,3,11,"Let him turn away from evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it."
60,3,12,"For the eyes of the Lord"
60,3,13,"And who"
60,3,14,"But if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy"
60,3,15,"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and"
60,3,16,"Having a good conscience; that, though they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good behaviour in Christ."
60,3,17,"For"
60,3,18,"For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit:"
60,3,19,"By whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;"
60,3,20,"Who at one time were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing, in which few, that is, eight souls were saved by water."
60,3,21,"The like figure to which"
60,3,22,"Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him."
60,4,1,"Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;"
60,4,2,"That he no longer should live the rest of"
60,4,3,"For the time past of"
60,4,4,"In which they think it strange that ye run not with"
60,4,5,"Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead."
60,4,6,"For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit."
60,4,7,"But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober minded, and watch to prayer."
60,4,8,"And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover a multitude of sins."
60,4,9,"Use hospitality one to another without grudging."
60,4,10,"As every man hath received the gift,"
60,4,11,"If any man speaketh,"
60,4,12,"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you:"
60,4,13,"But rejoice, seeing ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy."
60,4,14,"If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, happy"
60,4,15,"But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or"
60,4,16,"Yet if"
60,4,17,"For the time"
60,4,18,"And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?"
60,4,19,"Therefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls"
60,5,1,"The elders who are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:"
60,5,2,"Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight"
60,5,3,"Neither as being lords over"
60,5,4,"And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away."
60,5,5,"Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves to the elder. Yea, all"
60,5,6,"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:"
60,5,7,"Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you."
60,5,8,"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:"
60,5,9,"Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world."
60,5,10,"But the God of all grace, who hath called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle"
60,5,11,"To him"
60,5,12,"By Silvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which ye stand."
60,5,13,"The"
60,5,14,"Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace"
61,1,1,"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:"
61,1,2,"Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,"
61,1,3,"According as his divine power hath given to us all things that"
61,1,4,"By which are given to us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
61,1,5,"And besides this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;"
61,1,6,"And to knowledge self–control; and to self–control patience; and to patience godliness;"
61,1,7,"And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity."
61,1,8,"For if these things are in you, and abound, they make"
61,1,9,"But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purified from his old sins."
61,1,10,"Therefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:"
61,1,11,"For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."
61,1,12,"Therefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know"
61,1,13,"Indeed, I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting"
61,1,14,"Knowing that shortly I must put off"
61,1,15,"Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance."
61,1,16,"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
61,1,17,"For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
61,1,18,"And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him on the holy mount."
61,1,19,"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; to which ye do well that ye take heed, as to a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:"
61,1,20,"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation."
61,1,21,"For prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke"
61,2,1,"But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction."
61,2,2,"And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of."
61,2,3,"And through covetousness they shall with deceptive words exploit you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their destruction slumbereth not."
61,2,4,"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast"
61,2,5,"And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth"
61,2,6,"And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned"
61,2,7,"And delivered just Lot, grieved with the immoral behaviour of the wicked:"
61,2,8,"(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, tormented"
61,2,9,"The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust to the day of judgment to be punished:"
61,2,10,"But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous"
61,2,11,"Though angels, who are greater in power and might, bring not a reviling accusation against them before the Lord."
61,2,12,"But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;"
61,2,13,"And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness,"
61,2,14,"Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: they have an heart exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:"
61,2,15,"Who have forsaken the right way, and gone astray, following the way of Balaam"
61,2,16,"But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb donkey speaking with man’s voice forbad the madness of the prophet."
61,2,17,"These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever."
61,2,18,"For when they speak great swelling"
61,2,19,"While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for by whom a man is overcome, by the same is he brought into bondage."
61,2,20,"For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning."
61,2,21,"For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known"
61,2,22,"But it hath happened to them according to the true proverb, The dog"
61,3,1,"This second epistle, beloved, I now write to you; in"
61,3,2,"That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:"
61,3,3,"Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,"
61,3,4,"And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as"
61,3,5,"For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:"
61,3,6,"By which the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:"
61,3,7,"But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved to fire for the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men."
61,3,8,"But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day"
61,3,9,"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
61,3,10,"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are in it shall be burned up."
61,3,11,""
61,3,12,"Looking for and hasting to the coming of the day of God, when the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?"
61,3,13,"Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, in which dwelleth righteousness."
61,3,14,"Therefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found by him in peace, without spot, and blameless."
61,3,15,"And account"
61,3,16,"As also in all"
61,3,17,"Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know"
61,3,18,"But grow in grace, and"
62,1,1,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;"
62,1,2,"(For the life was revealed, and we have seen"
62,1,3,"That which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship"
62,1,4,"And these things we write to you, that your joy may be full."
62,1,5,"This then is the message which we have heard from him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
62,1,6,"If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:"
62,1,7,"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin."
62,1,8,"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."
62,1,9,"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us"
62,1,10,"If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."
62,2,1,"My little children, these things I write to you, that ye sin not. And if any man sinneth, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:"
62,2,2,"And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for"
62,2,3,"And by this we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments."
62,2,4,"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."
62,2,5,"But whoever keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: by this we know that we are in him."
62,2,6,"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked."
62,2,7,"Brethren, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning."
62,2,8,"Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth."
62,2,9,"He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now."
62,2,10,"He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him."
62,2,11,"But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not where he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes."
62,2,12,"I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake."
62,2,13,"I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him"
62,2,14,"I have written to you, fathers, because ye have known him"
62,2,15,"Love not the world, neither the things"
62,2,16,"For all that"
62,2,17,"And the world passeth away, and its lust: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever."
62,2,18,"Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist cometh, even now are there many antichrists; by which we know that it is the last time."
62,2,19,"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would"
62,2,20,"But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things."
62,2,21,"I have not written to you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth."
62,2,22,"Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son."
62,2,23,"Whoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father:"
62,2,24,"Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father."
62,2,25,"And this is the promise that he hath promised us,"
62,2,26,"These"
62,2,27,"But the anointing which ye have received from him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man should teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you concerning all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him."
62,2,28,"And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming."
62,2,29,"If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him."
62,3,1,"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not."
62,3,2,"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is."
62,3,3,"And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure."
62,3,4,"Whoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law."
62,3,5,"And ye know that he appeared to take away our sins; and in him is no sin."
62,3,6,"Whoever abideth in him sinneth not: whoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him."
62,3,7,"Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous."
62,3,8,"He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy the works of the devil."
62,3,9,"Whoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God."
62,3,10,"In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil: whoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother."
62,3,11,"For this is the message that ye have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another."
62,3,12,"Not as Cain,"
62,3,13,"Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you."
62,3,14,"We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not"
62,3,15,"Whoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him."
62,3,16,"By this we perceive the love"
62,3,17,"But he who hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his compassions from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?"
62,3,18,"My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth."
62,3,19,"And by this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him."
62,3,20,"For if our heart condemneth us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things."
62,3,21,"Beloved, if our heart doth not condemn us,"
62,3,22,"And whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight."
62,3,23,"And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment."
62,3,24,"And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And by this we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit who he hath given to us."
62,4,1,"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets have gone out into the world."
62,4,2,"By this ye know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ hath come in the flesh is from God:"
62,4,3,"And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not from God: and this is that"
62,4,4,"Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world."
62,4,5,"They are of the world: therefore they speak from the world, and the world heareth them."
62,4,6,"We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error."
62,4,7,"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is from God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God."
62,4,8,"He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love."
62,4,9,"In this was revealed the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him."
62,4,10,"In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son"
62,4,11,"Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another."
62,4,12,"No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us."
62,4,13,"By this we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit."
62,4,14,"And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son"
62,4,15,"Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God."
62,4,16,"And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him."
62,4,17,"In this is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world."
62,4,18,"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love."
62,4,19,"We love him, because he first loved us."
62,4,20,"If a man saith, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?"
62,4,21,"And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also."
62,5,1,"Whoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten by him."
62,5,2,"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments."
62,5,3,"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not burdensome."
62,5,4,"For whoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world,"
62,5,5,"Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"
62,5,6,"This is he that came by water and blood,"
62,5,7,"For there are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one."
62,5,8,"And there are three that bear witness on earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one."
62,5,9,"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son."
62,5,10,"He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he hath not believed the testimony that God gave of his Son."
62,5,11,"And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son."
62,5,12,"He that hath the Son hath life;"
62,5,13,"These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God."
62,5,14,"And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:"
62,5,15,"And if we know that he heareth us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired from him."
62,5,16,"If any man shall see his brother sin a sin"
62,5,17,"All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not to death."
62,5,18,"We know that whoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not."

63,1,1,"The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;"
63,1,2,"For the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever."
63,1,3,"Grace be with you, mercy,"
63,1,4,"I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father."
63,1,5,"And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another."
63,1,6,"And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it."
63,1,7,"For many deceivers have entered into the world, who confess not Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist."

63,1,13,"The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen."
64,1,1,"The elder to the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in truth."
64,1,2,"Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth."
64,1,3,"For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth."
64,1,4,"I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth."
64,1,5,"Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;"
64,1,6,"Who have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou shalt bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:"
64,1,7,"Because for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing from the Gentiles."
64,1,8,"We therefore ought to receive such, that we may be fellowhelpers to the truth."
64,1,9,"I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not."
64,1,10,"Therefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content with that, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth"
64,1,11,"Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God."
64,1,12,"Demetrius hath good report by all"
64,1,13,"I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write to thee:"
64,1,14,"But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace"
65,1,1,"Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ,"
65,1,2,"Mercy to you, and peace, and love, be multiplied."
65,1,3,"Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write to you concerning the common salvation, it was needful for me to write to you, and exhort"
65,1,4,"For certain men have crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ."
65,1,5,"I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not."
65,1,6,"And the angels who kept not their proper abode, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day."
65,1,7,"Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to gross immorality, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."
65,1,8,"Likewise also these"
65,1,9,"Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a reviling accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee."
65,1,10,"But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves."
65,1,11,"Woe to them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and run greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah."
65,1,12,"These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds"
65,1,13,"Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever."
65,1,14,"And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,"
65,1,15,"To execute judgment upon all, and to convict all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have impiously committed, and of all their hard"
65,1,16,"These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling"
65,1,17,"But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
65,1,18,"How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts."
65,1,19,"These are they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit."
65,1,20,"But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying by the Holy Spirit,"
65,1,21,"Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life."
65,1,22,"And of some have compassion, making a difference:"
65,1,23,"And others save with fear, pulling"
65,1,24,"Now to him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present"
65,1,25,"To God the only wise, our Saviour,"
66,1,1,"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified"
66,1,2,"Who bore witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw."
66,1,3,"Blessed"
66,1,4,"John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace"
66,1,5,"And from Jesus Christ,"
66,1,6,"And hath made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him"

66,1,8,"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty."
66,1,9,"I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ."
66,1,10,"I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,"
66,1,11,"Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send"
66,1,12,"And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands;"
66,1,13,"And in the midst of the seven lampstands"
66,1,14,"His head and"
66,1,15,"And his feet like fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters."
66,1,16,"And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance"
66,1,17,"And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying to me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:"
66,1,18,"I"
66,1,19,"Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be after this;"
66,1,20,"The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven lampstands which thou sawest are the seven churches."
66,2,1,"To the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden lampstands;"
66,2,2,"I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and that thou canst not bear them who are evil: and thou hast tried them who say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:"
66,2,3,"And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted."
66,2,4,"Nevertheless I have"
66,2,5,"Remember therefore from which thou hast fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to thee quickly, and will remove thy lampstand out of its place, except thou repent."
66,2,6,"But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
66,2,7,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God."
66,2,8,"And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, who was dead, and is alive;"
66,2,9,"I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and"
66,2,10,"Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast"
66,2,11,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death."
66,2,12,"And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he who hath the sharp sword with two edges;"
66,2,13,"I know thy works, and where thou dwellest,"
66,2,14,"But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit"
66,2,15,"So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate."
66,2,16,"Repent; or else I will come to thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth."
66,2,17,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth except he that receiveth"
66,2,18,"And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet"
66,2,19,"I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last"
66,2,20,"However I have a few things against thee, because thou allowest that woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit"
66,2,21,"And I gave her time to repent of her immorality; and she repented not."
66,2,22,"Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds."
66,2,23,"And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he who searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give to each one of you according to your works."

66,2,25,"But that which ye have"
66,2,26,"And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works to the end, to him will I give power over the nations:"
66,2,27,"And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father."
66,2,28,"And I will give him the morning star."
66,2,29,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches."
66,3,1,"And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead."
66,3,2,"Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God."
66,3,3,"Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee."
66,3,4,"Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy."
66,3,5,"He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels."
66,3,6,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches."
66,3,7,"And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;"
66,3,8,"I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name."
66,3,9,"Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee."
66,3,10,"Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth."
66,3,11,"Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown."
66,3,12,"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God,"
66,3,13,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches."
66,3,14,"And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;"
66,3,15,"I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot."
66,3,16,"So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth."
66,3,17,"Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:"
66,3,18,"I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and"
66,3,19,"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent."
66,3,20,"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man shall hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me."
66,3,21,"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father on his throne."
66,3,22,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches."
66,4,1,"After this I looked, and, behold, a door"
66,4,2,"And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and"
66,4,3,"And he that sat was in appearance like a jasper and a sardius stone: and"
66,4,4,"And around the throne"
66,4,5,"And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and"
66,4,6,"And in front of the throne"
66,4,7,"And the first living being"
66,4,8,"And the four living beings had each of them six wings about"
66,4,9,"And when those living beings give glory and honour and thanks to him that is seated on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,"
66,4,10,"The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,"
66,4,11,"Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created."
66,5,1,"And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals."
66,5,2,"And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose its seals?"
66,5,3,"And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look on it."
66,5,4,"And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look on it."
66,5,5,"And one of the elders saith to me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose its seven seals."
66,5,6,"And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four living beings, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth."
66,5,7,"And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne."
66,5,8,"And when he had taken the book, the four living beings and four"
66,5,9,"And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open its seals: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;"
66,5,10,"And hast made us to our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth."
66,5,11,"And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living beings and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;"
66,5,12,"Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing."
66,5,13,"And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power,"
66,5,14,"And the four living beings said, Amen. And the four"
66,6,1,"And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four living beings saying, Come and see."
66,6,2,"And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given to him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer."
66,6,3,"And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living being say, Come and see."
66,6,4,"And there went out another horse"
66,6,5,"And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living being say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand."
66,6,6,"And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living beings say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and"
66,6,7,"And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living being say, Come and see."
66,6,8,"And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth."
66,6,9,"And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:"
66,6,10,"And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?"
66,6,11,"And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they"
66,6,12,"And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;"
66,6,13,"And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, even as a fig tree casteth its untimely figs, when it is shaken by a mighty wind."
66,6,14,"And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and isle were moved out of their places."
66,6,15,"And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every slave, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;"
66,6,16,"And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:"
66,6,17,"For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?"
66,7,1,"And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree."
66,7,2,"And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,"
66,7,3,"Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads."
66,7,4,"And I heard the number of them who were sealed:"
66,7,5,"Of the tribe of Judah"
66,7,6,"Of the tribe of Asher"
66,7,7,"Of the tribe of Simeon"
66,7,8,"Of the tribe of Zebulun"
66,7,9,"After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;"
66,7,10,"And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb."
66,7,11,"And all the angels stood around the throne, and"
66,7,12,"Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might,"
66,7,13,"And one of the elders answered, saying to me, Who are these that are arrayed in white robes? and where did they come from?"
66,7,14,"And I said to him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they who came out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
66,7,15,"Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them."
66,7,16,"They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat."
66,7,17,"For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them to living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."
66,8,1,"And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour."
66,8,2,"And I saw the seven angels who stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets."
66,8,3,"And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer"
66,8,4,"And the smoke of the incense,"
66,8,5,"And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast"
66,8,6,"And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound."
66,8,7,"The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mixed with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up."
66,8,8,"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;"
66,8,9,"And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed."
66,8,10,"And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;"
66,8,11,"And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter."
66,8,12,"And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise."
66,8,13,"And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!"
66,9,1,"And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit."
66,9,2,"And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit."
66,9,3,"And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power."
66,9,4,"And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men who have not the seal of God in their foreheads."
66,9,5,"And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment"
66,9,6,"And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them."
66,9,7,"And the shapes of the locusts"
66,9,8,"And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as"
66,9,9,"And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings"
66,9,10,"And they had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power"
66,9,11,"And they had a king over them,"
66,9,12,"One woe is past;"
66,9,13,"And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,"
66,9,14,"Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels who are bound in the great river Euphrates."
66,9,15,"And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, to slay the third part of men."
66,9,16,"And the number of the army of the horsemen"
66,9,17,"And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses"
66,9,18,"By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths."
66,9,19,"For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails"
66,9,20,"And the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:"
66,9,21,"Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their immorality, nor of their thefts."
66,10,1,"And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow"
66,10,2,"And he had in his hand a little scroll open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and"
66,10,3,"And cried with a loud voice, as"
66,10,4,"And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not."
66,10,5,"And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,"
66,10,6,"And swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that are in it, and the earth, and the things that are in it, and the sea, and the things which are in it, that there should be delay no longer:"
66,10,7,"But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets."
66,10,8,"And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said, Go"
66,10,9,"And I went to the angel, and said to him, Give me the little scroll. And he said to me, Take"
66,10,10,"And I took the little scroll out of the angel’s hand, and ate it; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter."
66,10,11,"And he said to me, Thou must prophesy again concerning many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings."
66,11,1,"And there was given me a reed like a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship in it."
66,11,2,"But the court which is outside the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given to the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty"
66,11,3,"And I will give"
66,11,4,"These are the two olive trees, and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth."
66,11,5,"And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed."
66,11,6,"These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will."
66,11,7,"And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them."
66,11,8,"And their dead bodies"
66,11,9,"And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not permit their dead bodies to be put in graves."
66,11,10,"And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth."
66,11,11,"And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them who saw them."
66,11,12,"And they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they ascended to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them."
66,11,13,"And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were killed of men seven thousand: and the remnant were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven."
66,11,14,"The second woe is past;"
66,11,15,"And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become"
66,11,16,"And the four and twenty elders, who sat before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,"
66,11,17,"Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned."
66,11,18,"And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them who destroy the earth."
66,11,19,"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail."
66,12,1,"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:"
66,12,2,"And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered."
66,12,3,"And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads."
66,12,4,"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered, to devour her child as soon as he was born."
66,12,5,"And she brought forth a son, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up to God, and"
66,12,6,"And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred"
66,12,7,"And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,"
66,12,8,"And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven."
66,12,9,"And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, who deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out upon the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."
66,12,10,"And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night."
66,12,11,"And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives to the death."
66,12,12,"Therefore rejoice,"
66,12,13,"And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the son."
66,12,14,"And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent."
66,12,15,"And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood."
66,12,16,"And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth."
66,12,17,"And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."
66,13,1,"And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy."
66,13,2,"And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were as"
66,13,3,"And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast."
66,13,4,"And they worshipped the dragon which gave power to the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who"
66,13,5,"And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given to him to continue forty"
66,13,6,"And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven."
66,13,7,"And it was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations."
66,13,8,"And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
66,13,9,"If any man hath an ear, let him hear."
66,13,10,"He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints."
66,13,11,"And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon."
66,13,12,"And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed."
66,13,13,"And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,"
66,13,14,"And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by"
66,13,15,"And he had power to give life to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."
66,13,16,"And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:"
66,13,17,"And that no man might buy or sell, except him that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."
66,13,18,"Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number"
66,14,1,"And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Zion, and with him an hundred"
66,14,2,"And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:"
66,14,3,"And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred"
66,14,4,"These are they who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men,"
66,14,5,"And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God."
66,14,6,"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,"
66,14,7,"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."
66,14,8,"And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her immorality."
66,14,9,"And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth"
66,14,10,"The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:"
66,14,11,"And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receiveth the mark of his name."
66,14,12,"Here is the patience of the saints: here"
66,14,13,"And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed"
66,14,14,"And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud"
66,14,15,"And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe."
66,14,16,"And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped."
66,14,17,"And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle."
66,14,18,"And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe."
66,14,19,"And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast"
66,14,20,"And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even to the horses’ bridles, by the space of a thousand"
66,15,1,"And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God."
66,15,2,"And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gained the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark,"
66,15,3,"And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous"
66,15,4,"Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for"
66,15,5,"And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:"
66,15,6,"And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden bands."
66,15,7,"And one of the four living beings gave to the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever."
66,15,8,"And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled."
66,16,1,"And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth."
66,16,2,"And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a foul and loathsome sore upon the men who had the mark of the beast, and"
66,16,3,"And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead"
66,16,4,"And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood."
66,16,5,"And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, who art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus."
66,16,6,"For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy."
66,16,7,"And I heard another from the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous"
66,16,8,"And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given to him to scorch men with fire."
66,16,9,"And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, who hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory."
66,16,10,"And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,"
66,16,11,"And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds."
66,16,12,"And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared."
66,16,13,"And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs"
66,16,14,"For they are the spirits of demons, working miracles,"
66,16,15,"Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed"
66,16,16,"And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon."
66,16,17,"And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done."
66,16,18,"And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as hath not been since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake,"
66,16,19,"And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath."
66,16,20,"And every isle fled away, and the mountains were not found."
66,16,21,"And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven,"
66,17,1,"And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come; I will show to thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters:"
66,17,2,"With whom the kings of the earth have committed"
66,17,3,"So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns."
66,17,4,"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her immorality:"
66,17,5,"And upon her forehead"
66,17,6,"And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great wonder."
66,17,7,"And the angel said to me, Why didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns."
66,17,8,"The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is."
66,17,9,"And here"
66,17,10,"And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is,"
66,17,11,"And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition."
66,17,12,"And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast."
66,17,13,"These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength to the beast."
66,17,14,"These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him"
66,17,15,"And he saith to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues."
66,17,16,"And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire."
66,17,17,"For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled."
66,17,18,"And the woman whom thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth."
66,18,1,"And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was made bright with his glory."
66,18,2,"And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of demons, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird."
66,18,3,"For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed"
66,18,4,"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues."
66,18,5,"For her sins have reached to heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities."
66,18,6,"Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double to her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double."
66,18,7,"How much she hath glorified herself, and lived luxuriously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow."
66,18,8,"Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong"
66,18,9,"And the kings of the earth, who have committed"
66,18,10,"Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come."
66,18,11,"And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:"
66,18,12,"The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all kinds of vessels of ivory, and all kinds of vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,"
66,18,13,"And cinnamon, and incense, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and bodies, and souls of men."
66,18,14,"And the fruits that thy soul lusted after have departed from thee, and all things which were luxurious and splendid have departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all."
66,18,15,"The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,"
66,18,16,"And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!"
66,18,17,"For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,"
66,18,18,"And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What"
66,18,19,"And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, in which were made rich all that had ships in the sea by her wealth! for in one hour is she made desolate."
66,18,20,"Rejoice over her,"
66,18,21,"And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast"
66,18,22,"And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be no more heard in thee; and no craftsman, of whatever craft"
66,18,23,"And the light of a lamp shall shine no more in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived."
66,18,24,"And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth."
66,19,1,"And after these things I heard a great voice of many people in heaven, saying, Hallelujah; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, to the Lord our God:"
66,19,2,"For true and righteous"
66,19,3,"And again they said, Hallelujah. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever."
66,19,4,"And the four and twenty elders and the four living beings fell down and worshipped God who sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Hallelujah."
66,19,5,"And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great."
66,19,6,"And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Hallelujah: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth."
66,19,7,"Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready."
66,19,8,"And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints."
66,19,9,"And he saith to me, Write, Blessed"
66,19,10,"And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See"
66,19,11,"And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him"
66,19,12,"His eyes"
66,19,13,"And he"
66,19,14,"And the armies"
66,19,15,"And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God."
66,19,16,"And he hath on"
66,19,17,"And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God;"
66,19,18,"That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all"
66,19,19,"And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army."
66,19,20,"And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."
66,19,21,"And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which"
66,20,1,"And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand."
66,20,2,"And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, who is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,"
66,20,3,"And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season."
66,20,4,"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them: and"
66,20,5,"But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This"
66,20,6,"Blessed and holy"
66,20,7,"And when the thousand years have ended, Satan shall be loosed from his prison,"
66,20,8,"And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom"
66,20,9,"And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."
66,20,10,"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet"
66,20,11,"And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them."
66,20,12,"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is"
66,20,13,"And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works."
66,20,14,"And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."
66,20,15,"And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."
66,21,1,"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away; and there was no more sea."
66,21,2,"And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."
66,21,3,"And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God"
66,21,4,"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things have passed away."
66,21,5,"And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful."
66,21,6,"And he said to me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that is thirsty of the fountain of the water of life freely."
66,21,7,"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son."
66,21,8,"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and immoral persons, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."
66,21,9,"And there came to me one of the seven angels who had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife."
66,21,10,"And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,"
66,21,11,"Having the glory of God: and her light"
66,21,12,"And had a wall great and high,"
66,21,13,"On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates."
66,21,14,"And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
66,21,15,"And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and its gates, and its wall."
66,21,16,"And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and its height are equal."
66,21,17,"And he measured its wall, an hundred"
