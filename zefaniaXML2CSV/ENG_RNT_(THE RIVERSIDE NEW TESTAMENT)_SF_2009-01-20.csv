40,1,1,"THE ancestral line of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:"
40,1,2,"Abraham was the father of Isaac; Isaac was the father of Jacob; Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers;"
40,1,3,"Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah"
40,1,4,"Ram was the father of Amminadab; Amminadab was the father of Nahshon; Nahshon was the father of Salmon;"
40,1,5,"Salmon was the father of Boaz"
40,1,6,"Jesse was the father of David the King. David was the father of Solomon"
40,1,7,"Solomon was the father of Rehoboam; Rehoboam was the father of Abijah; Abijah was the father of Asa;"
40,1,8,"Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram; Joram was the father of Uzziah;"
40,1,9,"Uzziah was the father of Jotham; Jotham was the father of Ahaz; Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah;"
40,1,10,"Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh; Manasseh was the father of Amon; Amon was the father of Josiah;"
40,1,11,"Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile."
40,1,12,"After the Babylonian exile, Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel; Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel;"
40,1,13,"Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud; Abiud was the father of Eliakim; Eliakim was the father of Azor;"
40,1,14,"Azor was the father of Sadoc; Sadoc was the father of Achim; Achim was the father of Eliud;"
40,1,15,"Eliud was the father of Eleazar; Eleazar was the father of Matthan; Matthan was the father of Jacob;"
40,1,16,"Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."
40,1,17,"So there were in all fourteen generations from Abraham to David, and fourteen generations from David to the Babylonian exile, and fourteen generations from the Babylonian exile to the Christ."
40,1,18,"The birth of Jesus was in this way: His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, but before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit."
40,1,19,"Joseph, her husband, being an upright man, and yet not willing to make her a public example, resolved to dismiss her privately."
40,1,20,"But while he was thinking this over, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit."
40,1,21,"She will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
40,1,22,"All this happened in fulfillment of what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:"
40,1,23,"Behold the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and they will call his name Immanuel"
40,1,24,"When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took his wife to his home."
40,1,25,"But he did not live with her as a husband until she had borne a son. He called his name Jesus."
40,2,1,"AFTER Jesus had been born in Bethlehem, in Judaea, in the days of Herod the King, wise men from the East arrived at Jerusalem,"
40,2,2,"saying, Where is he who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the East and have come to do homage to him."
40,2,3,"When King Herod heard it, he was disturbed, and so was all Jerusalem."
40,2,4,"Then he called together all the high priests and scribes of the people and inquired of them where the Christ was to be born."
40,2,5,"They said to him, In Bethlehem, in Juda. For so it was written by the prophet,"
40,2,6,"'And thou, Bethlehem, land of Judah, art by no means least among the leaders of Judah; for from thee will come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel.' "
40,2,7,"Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and learned from them exactly the time of the star's appearance,"
40,2,8,"and as he sent them to Bethlehem he said, Go and make careful inquiries about the child, and when you have found him bring me word, so that I too may come and do homage to him."
40,2,9,"After hearing the king, they journeyed on, and the star which they had seen in the East went before them until it came and stood over where the child was."
40,2,10,"When they saw the star, they were very joyful."
40,2,11,"They entered the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and did him homage. Then they opened their treasures and presented to him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh."
40,2,12,"After this they were warned in a dream not to return to Herod, and so went by another mad back to their own country."
40,2,13,"After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph and said, Rise up, and take the child and his mother and flee into Egypt, and be there until I tell you, for Herod will search for the child in order to kill him."
40,2,14,"So Joseph rose up, and took the child and his mother in the night and went away to Egypt,"
40,2,15,"and was there until the death of Herod, in order that the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, Out of Egypt I called my Son."
40,2,16,"Then Herod, seeing that he had been outwitted by the wise men, became furious, and sent out and killed all the boy babies two years old and under in Bethlehem and all its neighborhood, guided by the date which he had carefully learned from the wise men."
40,2,17,"Then was fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet when he said,"
40,2,18,"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and bitter lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted because they are not."
40,2,19,"But after Herod had died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt"
40,2,20,"and said, Arise, and take the child and his mother and go into the land of Israel, for they are dead who sought the child's life."
40,2,21,"So he arose, and took the child and his mother and came into the land of Israel."
40,2,22,"But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being directed in a dream he went away to the region of Galilee"
40,2,23,"and settled in a town called Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, He will be called a Nazarene."
40,3,1,"IN those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wild part of Judaea"
40,3,2,"and saying, Repent; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
40,3,3,"For this is he who was foretold through Isaiah the prophet when he said: 'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Make ready the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.' "
40,3,4,"This John had his clothing of camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey."
40,3,5,"Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judaea and all the neighborhood of the Jordan"
40,3,6,"and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins."
40,3,7,"When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said, Brood of vipers, who directed you to flee from the coming wrath?"
40,3,8,"Produce fruit fitting for a change of heart,"
40,3,9,"and do not think of saying to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I tell you God is able out of these stones to raise up children for Abraham."
40,3,10,"Now the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not yield good fruit will be cut down and cast into the fire."
40,3,11,"I baptize you with water for a change of heart, but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I; I am not worthy to carry his shoes; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire."
40,3,12,"He has his fan in his hand and will thoroughly clean his threshing-floor. He will gather his grain into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."
40,3,13,"Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him."
40,3,14,"But John opposed him, saying, I have need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"
40,3,15,"Jesus replied,"
40,3,16,"Jesus, as soon as he was baptized, went up from the water, and the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon him."
40,3,17,"A voice from the heavens said, This is my Son, the beloved in whom I delight."
40,4,1,"THEN Jesus was led by the Spirit up into the wild country to be tempted by the Devil."
40,4,2,"After he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was hungry."
40,4,3,"Then the tempter came and said to him, If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to turn into loaves of bread."
40,4,4,"But he answered,"
40,4,5,"Then the Devil took him with him to the holy city and placed him on the top of the temple"
40,4,6,"and said to him, If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, 'To his angels he will give charge of you, and on their hands they will bear you lest you strike your foot against a stone.' "
40,4,7,"Jesus said to him,"
40,4,8,"Again the Devil took him with him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,"
40,4,9,"and said to him, All these things I will give you if you will fall down and do homage to me."
40,4,10,"Jesus said to him,"
40,4,11,"Then the Devil left him, and angels came and waited upon him."
40,4,12,"When Jesus heard that John had been betrayed, he went away into Galilee."
40,4,13,"Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum on the lake shore on the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,"
40,4,14,"so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:"
40,4,15,"Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, road to the sea, country beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,"
40,4,16,"the people that sat in darkness saw a great light and upon those sitting in the land and shadow of death light dawned."
40,4,17,"From that time Jesus began to proclaim and say,"
40,4,18,"As he was walking along the shore of the lake of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen;"
40,4,19,"and he said to them,"
40,4,20,"They at once left the nets and followed him."
40,4,21,"Going on from there, he saw two other brothers \'97 James the son of Zebedee and John his brother \'97 in their boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them."
40,4,22,"They at once left the boat and their father and followed him."
40,4,23,"Jesus went around through the whole of Galilee, teaching in the synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people."
40,4,24,"His fame spread out into all Syria, and they brought to him all who were sick with various diseases and those suffering from acute pain, demoniacs, lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them."
40,4,25,"Great crowds followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and from beyond the Jordan."
40,5,1,"SEEING the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he had seated himself his disciples came to him."
40,5,2,"He opened his mouth and taught them, saying:"

40,8,17,"This was in order to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, He took our weaknesses and bore away our diseases."

40,26,68,"saying, Act the prophet for us, you Christ! Who was it that struck you? "
40,26,69,"Peter was sitting outside in the court. A maid came up to him and said, You too were with Jesus the Galilaean."

40,26,72,"Then again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man."
40,26,73,"After a little those who were standing there came up and said to Peter, Truly you are one of them, for your accent proves it."

40,27,4,"saying, I sinned in betraying innocent blood! But they said, What is that to us? You must see to that."
40,27,5,"Then throwing the silver into the Temple he left and went and hung himself."
40,27,6,"The high priests took the money and said, It is not proper to put it in with the consecrated gifts, since it is the price of blood."
40,27,7,"So after consultation they bought with it the potter's field for the burial of strangers."
40,27,8,"For this reason that field is called the Field of Blood to this day."
40,27,9,"Then was fulfilled what was said through Jeremiah the prophet, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was priced, whom they priced from the sons of Israel,"
40,27,10,"and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."
40,27,11,"Jesus stood before the Governor. The Governor asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? Jesus said,"
40,27,12,"While he was being accused by the high priests and elders, he answered nothing."
40,27,13,"Then Pilate said to him, Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?"
40,27,14,"But Jesus did not answer even one word, so that the Governor was much astonished."
40,27,15,"At every feast the Governor was accustomed to release for the people one prisoner, whomever they chose."
40,27,16,"There was at that time a notorious prisoner named Barabbas."
40,27,17,"So, when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
40,27,18,"For he knew that out of jealousy they had handed him over."
40,27,19,"While he was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent to him a message, Do not have anything to do with that righteous man. For I have suffered much to-day in a dream because of him."
40,27,20,"The high priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus."
40,27,21,"The Governor said to them, Which of the two do you want me to release for you? They said, Barabbas."
40,27,22,"Pilate said to them, What, then, shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ? They all said, Have him crucified."
40,27,23,"He said, Why, what wrong has he done? But they kept shouting furiously, Have him crucified!"
40,27,24,"When Pilate saw that he was doing no good, but rather that an uproar was arising, he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd and said, I am innocent of this blood. You will have to see to it."
40,27,25,"All the people answered, His blood be on us and on our children!"
40,27,26,"Then he released Barabbas for them, but scourged Jesus and handed him over to be crucified."
40,27,27,"Then the soldiers of the Governor took Jesus with them into the castle and gathered about him all the battalion."
40,27,28,"They stripped him and put on him a crimson cloak,"
40,27,29,"twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head, put a reed into his right hand, and, going down on their knees before him, made sport of him, shouting, Hail, King of the Jews!"
40,27,30,"They spit on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head."
40,27,31,"After they had finished making sport of him, they took off from him the crimson cloak and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucifixion."
40,27,32,"As they were going out, they chanced upon a man from Cyrene by the name of Simon. This man they impressed to carry the cross of Jesus."
40,27,33,"On coming to a place called Golgotha"
40,27,34,"they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink. He tasted it and would not drink it."
40,27,35,"When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes by casting lots."
40,27,36,"Then they sat and kept watch over him there."
40,27,37,"Above his head they put up the charge against him in writing:"
40,27,38,"At the same time there were crucified along with him two robbers, one on his right and one on his left."
40,27,39,"The people who went by insulted him, shaking their heads"
40,27,40,"and saying, You who can pull down the Temple and in three days build it up, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
40,27,41,"In the same way the high priests, making sport of him, along with the scribes and elders, kept saying,"
40,27,42,"He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross and we will believe in him."
40,27,43,"He trusted in God, let him deliver him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.' "
40,27,44,"In the same way even the robbers who were crucified with him insulted him."
40,27,45,"From noon darkness came over all the land until three o'clock."
40,27,46,"About three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice,"
40,27,47,"Some of those who were standing there said, when they heard it, This man is calling for Elijah."
40,27,48,"Immediately one of them took a sponge and filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave him a drink."
40,27,49,"The rest said, Let him alone, let us see whether Elijah comes to save him."
40,27,50,"But Jesus, after calling out again with a loud voice, gave up his spirit."
40,27,51,"Suddenly the curtain of the Temple was rent in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked. The rocks were split,"
40,27,52,"and the tombs were opened and many bodies of the sleeping saints arose,"
40,27,53,"and, coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many."
40,27,54,"The Centurion and his men who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that happened, were greatly terrified and said, Truly this man was a son of God!"
40,27,55,"Looking on from a distance, were many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee, waiting upon him."
40,27,56,"Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee."
40,27,57,"In the late afternoon there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus."
40,27,58,"This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered it to be given to him."
40,27,59,"Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen sheet"
40,27,60,"and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. Then he rolled a great stone up to the door of the tomb and went away."
40,27,61,"Mary Magdalene remained there and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb."
40,27,62,"On the next day, that is, the day after the Preparation, the high priests and the Pharisees gathered about Pilate"
40,27,63,"and said, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was alive,"
40,27,64,"So give orders to have the tomb guarded until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has been raised from the dead,' and the last error will be worse than the first."
40,27,65,"Pilate said to them, You may have a guard. Go make it as secure as you know how."
40,27,66,"They went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone as well as setting a watch."
40,28,1,"LATE on the Sabbath, as the first day of the week was drawing near, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the tomb."
40,28,2,"And suddenly there was a great earthquake. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came to the stone and rolled it away and sat upon it."
40,28,3,"His appearance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow."
40,28,4,"For fear of him the guards trembled violently and became like dead men."
40,28,5,"The angel said to the women, Do not you be afraid. For I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
40,28,6,"He is not here. He has been raised, as he told you. Come see the place where he lay."
40,28,7,"Go quickly and tell his disciples that he has been raised from the dead. He will precede you to Galilee. There you will see him. See, I have told you."
40,28,8,"They left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples."
40,28,9,"Suddenly Jesus met them and said,"
40,28,10,"Then Jesus said to them,"
40,28,11,"While they were going, some of the guard came into the city and brought word to the high priests of all that had happened."
40,28,12,"After assembling with the elders and holding a consultation, they gave a good deal of money to the soldiers"
40,28,13,"and said, Say, 'His disciples came in the night and stole him away while we were asleep,'"
40,28,14,"and if this comes to the ears of the Governor we will persuade him and free you from trouble."
40,28,15,"The soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this report has been spread among the Jews to this day."
40,28,16,"The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed to meet them,"
40,28,17,"and they saw him and bowed down before him; but some doubted."
40,28,18,"Jesus came to them and talked with them. He said,"
40,28,19,""
40,28,20,""
41,1,1,"THE Beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ."
41,1,2,"It is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way."
41,1,3,"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord; make his paths straight' ;"
41,1,4,"just so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching the baptism of a change of heart for forgiveness of sins."
41,1,5,"All the land of Judaea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him and were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins."
41,1,6,"John's clothes were of camel's hair and he had a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey."
41,1,7,"He proclaimed, One is coming after me who is more powerful than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop and loose."
41,1,8,"I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
41,1,9,"In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan."
41,1,10,"Immediately as he was coming up from the water he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him."
41,1,11,"And there was a voice from the heavens, Thou art my Son, my Beloved; in thee I am well pleased."
41,1,12,"Immediately the spirit impelled him to go out into the wild lands."
41,1,13,"And he was in the wild lands forty days, tempted by Satan. There he was among the wild beasts, but angels waited upon him."
41,1,14,"After John had been betrayed, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God"
41,1,15,"and saying,"
41,1,16,"As he passed along by the lake of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen."
41,1,17,"Jesus said to them,"
41,1,18,"They immediately left their nets and followed him."
41,1,19,"Going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John in their boat, mending their net."
41,1,20,"Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him away."
41,1,21,"They came into Capernaum. Immediately on the Sabbath he went into the synagogue and taught."
41,1,22,"The people were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as if he had authority, and not as the scribes."
41,1,23,"There was in their synagogue a man wider the power of an impure spirit, and he immediately cried out,"
41,1,24,"What have you to do with us, Nazarene Jesus? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are \'97 the Holy one of God."
41,1,25,"But Jesus reproved him and said,"
41,1,26,"Then the impure spirit convulsed him, and screamed loudly and came out."
41,1,27,"They were all amazed so that they discussed together, What is this? A new powerful teaching! He commands even the impure spirits and they obey him!"
41,1,28,"So reports about him immediately spread everywhere through the whole region of Galilee."
41,1,29,"As soon as they had come out of the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John."
41,1,30,"The mother-in-law of Simon was lying sick with fever. Immediately they told him about her."
41,1,31,"He came to her, and took her by the hand and lifted her up. The fever left her and she waited on them."
41,1,32,"When evening came and the sun had set, they brought to him all the sick and those who were afflicted with demons;"
41,1,33,"and the whole city was gathered before the door."
41,1,34,"He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons, not allowing the demons to talk, because they knew him."
41,1,35,"Early in the morning, while it was still night, he rose and went out, and went away into a solitary place and there prayed."
41,1,36,"Simon and his companions searched for him,"
41,1,37,"and when they found him they said to him, All are looking for you?"
41,1,38,"But he said to them,"
41,1,39,"And he went through all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons."
41,1,40,"There came to him a leper, begging him and kneeling to him and saying, If you will, you can cleanse me."
41,1,41,"He had compassion on him, and stretched out his hand and touched him, and said,"
41,1,42,"Immediately the leprosy left him and he became clean."
41,1,43,"Then Jesus sent him away after strictly charging him,"
41,1,44,""
41,1,45,"But the man went away and began to proclaim freely and to spread the report, so that Jesus was no longer able to enter openly into any city, but stayed out in the wild country, and people came to him from every direction."
41,2,1,"HE came again into Capernaum, and after some days it was heard that he was in the house."
41,2,2,"Many came together, so that there was no longer room even near the door, and he preached to them."
41,2,3,"Then some people came bringing to him a paralytic, borne by four."
41,2,4,"Not being able to bring him near, owing to the crowd, they opened the roof where he was, and when they had broken through it, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying."
41,2,5,"When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic,"
41,2,6,"There were some of the scribes sitting there and debating in their minds,"
41,2,7,"Why does this man talk so? He speaks profane words. Who except God can forgive sins?"
41,2,8,"Immediately Jesus, perceiving that they were inwardly reasoning in this way, said to them,"

41,2,13,"Jesus went out again beside the lake, and all the crowd came to him and he taught them."
41,2,14,"As he was passing along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office and said to him,"
41,2,15,"Jesus was reclining at table in Levi's house, and many tax collectors and sinners also reclined at table along with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him."
41,2,16,"When the scribes and the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, Can it be that he eats with tax collectors and sinners?"
41,2,17,"When Jesus heard it, he said to them,"
41,2,18,"The disciples of John as well as the Pharisees were fasting. They came and said to Jesus, Why is it that the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but your disciples are not fasting?"
41,2,19,"Jesus replied,"

41,3,2,"They watched him to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might have something to say against him."
41,3,3,"He said to the man with the withered hand,"
41,3,4,"Then he said to them,"
41,3,5,"He looked round on them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man,"
41,3,6,"The Pharisees went out immediately and joined with the Herodians in a plot to put him out of the way."
41,3,7,"Then Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake and a great number from Galilee followed him. Also from Judaea"
41,3,8,"and from Jerusalem and from Idumaea and from beyond the Jordan and from the neighborhood of Tyre and Sidon, a great number, hearing of all that he was doing, came to him."
41,3,9,"Jesus spoke to his disciples to have a little boat ready for his use on account of the throng, to prevent them from pressing upon him."
41,3,10,"For he healed many, so that all that had diseases crowded around him to touch him."
41,3,11,"The impure spirits, also, when they saw him, fell down before him and shouted, You are the Son of God."
41,3,12,"But he ordered them repeatedly and sternly not to make him known."
41,3,13,"Jesus went up on the mountain and invited whom he chose, and they came to him."
41,3,14,"He appointed twelve who should be with him and whom he could send out to preach"
41,3,15,"and to have authority to cast out demons."
41,3,16,"He appointed these twelve: Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter"
41,3,17,"James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, to whom he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder,"
41,3,18,"Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon the Zealot,"
41,3,19,"and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. Jesus came into a house"
41,3,20,"and the crowd gathered again so that they were not able even to eat bread."
41,3,21,"When his family heard of it, they went out to take him by force, for they said, He is out of his mind."
41,3,22,"The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, He has Beelzebul in him, and by the Chief of the demons he casts out demons."

41,4,32,""
41,4,33,"With many such illustrations he went on talking to them as they were able to listen;"
41,4,34,"but except in figures of speech he did not talk to them. Privately to his own disciples he explained all things."
41,4,35,"On that day when evening came he said to them,"
41,4,36,"So they left the crowd and took him along just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with them."
41,4,37,"Then a heavy squall of wind came up and the waves beat into the boat so that it was filling."
41,4,38,"But he was in the stern asleep on the cushion. They aroused him and said to him, Teacher, do you not care that we are sinking?"
41,4,39,"When he awoke, he rebuked the wind and said to the sea,"
41,4,40,"Then he asked them,"
41,4,41,"But they were intensely awestruck and said to one another, Who, then, is this, that even the wind and the lake obey him?"
41,5,1,"THEY came to the other side of the lake, to the land of the Gerasenes."
41,5,2,"When he got out of the boat, immediately there came out of the tombs to meet him a man under the power of an impure spirit."
41,5,3,"This man made his dwelling in the tombs, and nobody could bind him even with a chain,"
41,5,4,"because he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart and the fetters broken in pieces by him, and no one was strong enough to tame him."
41,5,5,"All night and all day long he was in the tombs and in the mountains, shrieking and cutting himself with stones."
41,5,6,"When he saw Jesus a long way off, he ran and knelt to him"
41,5,7,"and shouted with a loud voice, What have I and you to do with each other, Jesus, Son of God most high? I adjure you by God, not to torment me."
41,5,8,"For Jesus had said to him,"
41,5,9,"Jesus asked him,"
41,5,10,"Then he begged Jesus earnestly not to send them out of the country."
41,5,11,"There was on the mountain-side a great herd of swine feeding,"
41,5,12,"and the demons begged him, Send us to the swine and let us go into them."
41,5,13,"He consented. The impure spirits came out of the man and entered into the swine. Then the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned in the lake."
41,5,14,"At this, those who were feeding them fled and told it in the city and in the fields, and people came to see what had happened."
41,5,15,"When they came to Jesus, they saw the demoniac, the man who had had the legion, sitting there clothed and in his right mind. They were struck with awe."
41,5,16,"Those who had seen it told them about what had happened to the demoniac and about the swine."
41,5,17,"Then they began to beg him to go away from their neighborhood."
41,5,18,"As Jesus was entering the boat, the man who had been demoniac begged him to let him stay with him."
41,5,19,"He, however, did not consent, but said,"
41,5,20,"So he went away and began to make known in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him; and all were astonished."
41,5,21,"When Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the other side of the lake, a great crowd gathered around him as he stood on the shore."
41,5,22,"Then came one of the directors of the synagogue, by the name of Jairus, and as soon as he saw Jesus he fell at his feet"
41,5,23,"and pleaded with him earnestly, saying, My little daughter is near to death. I beg you to come and lay your hands on her so that she may be saved and live."
41,5,24,"Jesus went away with him and a great crowd followed and pressed upon him."
41,5,25,"There was a woman who had for twelve years had a hemorrhage"
41,5,26,"and had suffered much under the treatment of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, though without becoming better, but rather worse;"
41,5,27,"this woman had heard about Jesus, and she came in the crowd behind him and touched his cloak,"
41,5,28,"for she said, If I can touch even his clothes, I shall be healed."
41,5,29,"Immediately the hemorrhage ceased and she knew in her body that she was healed of her affliction."
41,5,30,"Jesus was at once conscious that power had gone from him, and turned in the crowd and said,"
41,5,31,"His disciples replied, You see the people crowding you, and do you ask,"
41,5,32,"But he looked around to see who had done it."
41,5,33,"Then the woman, afraid and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell before him and told him all the truth."
41,5,34,"He said to her,"
41,5,35,"While he was still speaking, people came from the house of the synagogue Director and told him, Your daughter is dead; why annoy the teacher any longer?"
41,5,36,"But Jesus, overhearing what they were saying, said to the Director,"
41,5,37,"He did not permit any one to accompany him except Peter and James and John, the brother of James."
41,5,38,"When they approached the Director's house, they saw a noisy crowd weeping loudly and wailing."
41,5,39,"He entered and said,"
41,5,40,"But they laughed at him. Then he put them all out and took the child's father and mother and his own companions and went in where the child was."
41,5,41,"Taking hold of the child's hand he said to her,"
41,5,42,"Immediately the little girl rose up and walked around. She was twelve years old. They were utterly amazed."
41,5,43,"But he strictly ordered that no one should know it, and told them to give her something to eat."
41,6,1,"LEAVING there, he came to his own native place accompanied by his disciples."
41,6,2,"When the Sabbath came, he began teaching in the synagogue. Many who heard were astonished and said, Where did he get this, and what is this wisdom with which he is gifted? How are such deeds of power done by his hands?"
41,6,3,"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joseph and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? So they fell into mistake regarding him."
41,6,4,"But Jesus said to them,"
41,6,5,"There he was unable to do any work of power, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them."
41,6,6,"Their lack of faith astonished him. He made a circuit through the villages, teaching."
41,6,7,"Then he called together the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over impure spirits,"
41,6,8,"and instructed them not to take anything for their journey but just a stick; no bread, no bag, no coppers in their belts,"
41,6,9,"to be shod with sandals, and not to have two tunics."
41,6,10,"He said to them,"
41,6,11,""
41,6,12,"They went out and proclaimed that men should repent,"
41,6,13,"and they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many sick people and healed them."
41,6,14,"The name of Jesus was so much talked about that King Herod heard of it. Some were saying, John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these mighty works are done by him."
41,6,15,"Others said, It is Elijah, and others said, It is a prophet like one of the old prophets."
41,6,16,"But Herod, when he heard about him, said, John, the man whom I beheaded, has risen again."
41,6,17,"Herod himself had sent and arrested John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married."
41,6,18,"For John had said to Herod, It is not right for you to have your brother's wife."
41,6,19,"Herodias hated him and wished to kill him, but was unable to do so,"
41,6,20,"because Herod reverenced John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he protected him. When Herod heard John, he was much perplexed, and yet he was glad to listen to him."
41,6,21,"But an opportunity came for Herodias when Herod, on his birthday, gave a feast to his high officials and military officers and the leading men of Galilee."
41,6,22,"Then the daughter of Herodias came in and danced and pleased Herod and his guests. The King said to the girl, Ask me for whatever you will and I will give it to you."
41,6,23,"He swore, Whatever you ask I will give you, up to the half of my kingdom."
41,6,24,"The girl went out and said to her mother, What shall I ask? She replied, The head of John the Baptizer."
41,6,25,"The girl immediately hurried in and said to the King, I choose to have you give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter."
41,6,26,"This made the King very sorry, but on account of his oaths and his guests he was unwilling to refuse her."
41,6,27,"So he immediately sent one of the guardsmen with orders to bring John's head. The soldier went and beheaded him in the prison"
41,6,28,"and brought the head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother."
41,6,29,"When John's disciples heard about it, they came and took the body and laid it in a tomb."
41,6,30,"The apostles gathered back to Jesus and reported to him all that they had done and all that they had taught."
41,6,31,"He said to them,"
41,6,32,"So they put off in a boat for an uninhabited, solitary place."
41,6,33,"But many saw them going and recognized them, and ran together by land from all the towns and got there before them."
41,6,34,"When Jesus landed, he saw a great crowd, and he was filled with compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began and taught them many things."
41,6,35,"By this time it was late in the day, and his disciples came to him and said, This is an uninhabited place and the hour is already late."
41,6,36,"Send them away so that they can go to the farms and villages around and buy themselves something to eat."
41,6,37,"But Jesus answered,"
41,6,38,"He asked,"
41,6,39,"Then he told them to have all the people recline in groups on the green grass."
41,6,40,"They lay down in rows by hundreds and by fifties."
41,6,41,"Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looked up to heaven and blessed them, and broke them and gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people. The two fishes he also divided among all."
41,6,42,"All ate and had abundance,"
41,6,43,"and they picked up twelve basketfuls of the broken pieces of the bread, besides portions of the fishes."
41,6,44,"There were five thousand men who ate of the loaves."
41,6,45,"Jesus immediately had his disciples get into the boat and cross before him to Bethsaida while he was dismissing the crowd."
41,6,46,"After taking leave of them, he went away up the mountain to pray."
41,6,47,"When evening had fallen, the boat was half across the lake and he was alone on the land."
41,6,48,"He saw them distressed in rowing, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night, he came to them walking on the lake and he seemed to be going past them."
41,6,49,"But when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought that it was a ghost and cried out."
41,6,50,"For they all saw him and were frightened. But he immediately spoke to them and said,"
41,6,51,"Then he got into the boat with them and the wind dropped. They were in boundless amazement;"
41,6,52,"for they had not grasped the miracle of the loaves because their minds were dull."
41,6,53,"When they had crossed to the land they came to Gennesaret and dropped anchor."
41,6,54,"As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus"
41,6,55,"and hurried over all that region and brought in the sick on pallets wherever they heard that he was."
41,6,56,"Whenever he went into villages or towns or among the farms they would lay the sick in the streets and beg him to let them touch at least the tassel of his cloak. And all who touched were healed."
41,7,1,"ONCE the Pharisees gathered about him with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem,"
41,7,2,"and they saw that some of his disciples were eating bread with common, that is, unwashed, hands."
41,7,3,"For the Pharisees and all the Jews never eat without first washing their hands up to the wrist, holding faithfully to the tradition of their forefathers,"
41,7,4,"and when they return from market they do not eat until they have washed. There are also many other traditions which they have been taught to hold tenaciously, such as washing cups and pitchers and copper vessels."
41,7,5,"The Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why do not your disciples live according to the tradition of our fore-fathers? Why do they eat their bread with common hands?"
41,7,6,"He replied,"
41,7,7,""
41,7,8,""

41,7,14,"Then, calling the crowd to him again, he said to them,"

41,7,24,"Leaving that place, Jesus went into the borders of Tyre. He entered a house and did not wish any one to know it, but he could not escape notice."
41,7,25,"At once a woman whose daughter was afflicted by an impure spirit heard about him, and she came and fell at his feet."
41,7,26,"The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter."
41,7,27,"But he said,"
41,7,28,"She answered, Yes, Sir, even the dogs under the table eat from the children's crumbs."
41,7,29,"Then he said to her,"
41,7,30,"She returned to her house and found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone."
41,7,31,"Again leaving the region of Tyre, he came through Sidon to the lake of Galilee into the midst of the region of Decapolis."
41,7,32,"They brought to him a deaf man who stammered, and begged him to lay his hand on him."
41,7,33,"He took him aside from the crowd, put his fingers into his ears, and touched his tongue with spit."
41,7,34,"Then looking up to heaven, he sighed and said,"
41,7,35,"and his ears were opened, and immediately his tongue was freed and he talked plainly."
41,7,36,"Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell any one. But the more he forbade them the more widely they spread it,"
41,7,37,"for they were astonished beyond all bounds and said, He has done everything well. He makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak."
41,8,1,"IN those days, when there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called together his disciples and said to them,"

41,8,7,"They had also a few small fishes. These he blessed and told the disciples to distribute them."
41,8,8,"All ate and were satisfied, and they picked up of the fragments that were left over seven basketfuls."
41,8,9,"There were about four thousand men. Then he dismissed them."
41,8,10,"At once he got into a boat with the disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha."
41,8,11,"The Pharisees came out and began to argue with him, asking him for a sign from heaven, in order to test him."
41,8,12,"He sighed deeply and said,"
41,8,13,"Then he left them and got into the boat again and went away across the lake."
41,8,14,"They had forgotten to take bread, and except one loaf they had none with them in the boat."
41,8,15,"Jesus warned them,"
41,8,16,"They began to talk among themselves about their lack of bread."
41,8,17,"He perceived it, and said to them,"

41,8,24,"He looked up and said, I see the people; I see them like trees, walking around."
41,8,25,"Again Jesus put his hand on his eyes, and he looked and was restored and saw everything clearly."
41,8,26,"Then Jesus sent him away home, saying,"
41,8,27,"Jesus went away with his disciples to the villages round Caesarea Philippi. On the road he asked them,"
41,8,28,"They replied, Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; others say one of the prophets."
41,8,29,"He asked them,"
41,8,30,"He gave them strict orders not to tell any one about him."
41,8,31,"Then he began and taught them that it was necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders and the high priests and the scribes, and to be put to death, and after three days to rise again."
41,8,32,"He spoke about this frankly. But Peter took him and began to reprove him."

41,15,37,"But Jesus uttered a loud cry and ceased to breathe."
41,15,38,"Then the curtain in the Temple was torn in two from top to bottom."
41,15,39,"When the Centurion who was standing facing him saw that he expired in this way, he exclaimed, Truly this man was a son of God!"
41,15,40,"There were also some women looking on from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the Little and Joses, and Salome,"
41,15,41,"who when he was in Galilee used to follow him and wait on him, and there were many others who had come up with him to Jerusalem."
41,15,42,"It was now late in the afternoon and, since it was Preparation Day, that is the day before the Sabbath,"
41,15,43,"Joseph of Arimathaea, a councilor of high standing, who himself was looking for the kingdom of God, took courage to go in to Pilate and ask for the body of Jesus."
41,15,44,"Pilate wondered whether he was already dead, but he called in the Centurion and asked him whether Jesus had been long dead."
41,15,45,"Upon learning this from the Centurion, he granted the body to Joseph."
41,15,46,"Joseph bought a linen sheet and took him down and swathed him in it and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock. He then rolled a stone against the door of the tomb."
41,15,47,"Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on to see where Jesus was laid."
41,16,1,"WHEN the Sabbath had passed, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought perfumes to go and anoint him."
41,16,2,"Very early in the morning of the first day of the week they came to the tomb. The sun had risen."
41,16,3,"They were saying to one another, Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?"
41,16,4,"But when they looked they saw that the stone had been rolled away. It was very large."
41,16,5,"Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side dressed in a white robe, and they were frightened."
41,16,6,"But he said to them, Do not be frightened. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified. He has risen. He is not here. This is the place where they laid him."
41,16,7,"But go tell his disciples and Peter, He has gone before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he told you."
41,16,8,"The women came out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and amazement seized them. They told nothing to any one, they were so frightened."
41,16,9,"After Jesus rose early on the morning of the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons."
41,16,10,"She went and told those who had been with him as they were grieving and lamenting."
41,16,11,"But they, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe her."
41,16,12,"After this he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking into the country."
41,16,13,"They went and told the rest. But neither did they believe these men."
41,16,14,"Later he appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at table, and reproached them for their lack of faith and dullness of mind because they had not believed those who had seen him since his resurrection."
41,16,15,"He said to them,"
41,16,16,""
41,16,17,""
41,16,18,""
41,16,19,"Then the Lord Jesus, after talking with them, was taken up into heaven and sat down on the right hand of God."
41,16,20,"They went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming their message by the signs which accompanied it."
42,1,1,"INASMUCH as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative of those facts which are firmly believed among us,"
42,1,2,"just as those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and who became bearers of the message handed them down to us;"
42,1,3,"it has seemed good to me also \'97 since I have followed everything from the beginning accurately \'97 to write a consecutive account for you, most excellent Theophilus,"
42,1,4,"so that you may know the exact truth in regard to the matters which you have been taught by word of mouth."
42,1,5,"There was in the days of Herod, King of Judaea, a certain priest by the name of Zacharias, of the course of Abijah. His wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth."
42,1,6,"They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and regulations of the Lord blameless."
42,1,7,"But they had no child, for Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years."
42,1,8,"It happened that as Zacharias was performing his priestly duties before God in the order of his course,"
42,1,9,"according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him to enter the Temple of the Lord and offer the incense."
42,1,10,"All the congregation of people was in prayer outside, at the hour of incense."
42,1,11,"There appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing at the right side of the altar of incense."
42,1,12,"Zacharias, on seeing him, was alarmed and fear fell upon him."
42,1,13,"But the angel said to him, Do not fear, Zacharias, for your prayer has been heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear a son, and you will call his name John."
42,1,14,"You will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth."
42,1,15,"For he will be great before the Lord. He will not drink wine or strong drink. He will be full of the Holy Spirit even from his birth,"
42,1,16,"and many of the sons of Israel will he turn to the Lord their God."
42,1,17,"He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him."
42,1,18,"Zacharias said to the angel, By what proof shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years."
42,1,19,"The angel answered, I am Gabriel, who stands before the face of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to give you this good news."
42,1,20,"And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that this comes to pass, because you have not believed my words, which will be fulfilled in their time."
42,1,21,"The people were waiting for Zacharias and wondering at his staying so long in the Temple."
42,1,22,"But when he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the Temple. He kept making signs to them and remained dumb."
42,1,23,"When the days of his priestly service were finished, he went away to his home."
42,1,24,"After these days Elizabeth his wife conceived and hid herself five months, saying,"
42,1,25,"So has the Lord done for me in the days in which he has looked upon me to take away my reproach among men."
42,1,26,"In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,"
42,1,27,"to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The name of the virgin was Mary."
42,1,28,"The angel entered and said to her, Hail, favored one, the Lord is with you!"
42,1,29,"But she was alarmed at his words, and wondered what such a greeting could mean."
42,1,30,"The angel said to her, Do not fear, Mary; for you have found favor with God."
42,1,31,"You will conceive in your womb and will bear a son, and you must call his name Jesus."
42,1,32,"He will be great and will be called the Son of the Highest, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David."
42,1,33,"He will be king over the house of Jacob through the ages, and of his kingdom there will be no end."
42,1,34,"But Mary said to the angel, How can this be, since I am not united to a man?"
42,1,35,"The angel replied, The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Highest will overshadow you. For that reason the child that is begotten will be called holy, Son of God."
42,1,36,"And, indeed, Elizabeth your relative, even she, has conceived a son, in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren."
42,1,37,"For no word that comes from God will fail."
42,1,38,"Mary said, Here I am, the Lord's handmaid. Let it be to me according to your word. Then the angel left her."
42,1,39,"In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill-country to a city of Judah,"
42,1,40,"and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth."
42,1,41,"When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe leapt in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit"
42,1,42,"and spoke out with a loud voice and said, Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb!"
42,1,43,"But why do I have the honor of having the mother of my Lord come to me?"
42,1,44,"For, indeed, when the sound of your greeting fell upon my ears, the babe leapt for joy in my womb."
42,1,45,"Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a complete fulfillment of the things spoken to her from the Lord!"
42,1,46,"Then Mary said: My soul magnifies the Lord,"
42,1,47,"And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;"
42,1,48,"Because he has looked upon the low estate of his handmaid. Indeed, from this time all generations will call me blessed."
42,1,49,"Because the Mighty One has done great things for me. Holy is his name."
42,1,50,"His kindness is from generation to generation upon those who fear him."
42,1,51,"He shows strength with his arm; He scatters the proud in the thoughts of their hearts."
42,1,52,"He casts down princes from their thrones and raises up the lowly."
42,1,53,"The hungry he fills with good things and the affluent he sends away empty."
42,1,54,"He brings help to Israel his servant, mindful of kindness,"
42,1,55,"just as he promised our fathers, Abraham and his descendants, forever."
42,1,56,"Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home."
42,1,57,"When Elizabeth's due time came, she gave birth to a son."
42,1,58,"Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great kindness to her, and they rejoiced with her."
42,1,59,"On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him by the name of his father Zacharias."
42,1,60,"But his mother said, No, but he shall be called John."
42,1,61,"They said to her, There is no one of your family who is called by that name."
42,1,62,"Then they made signs to his father to know what he wanted him called."
42,1,63,"He asked for a tablet and wrote, His name is John. They all wondered."
42,1,64,"At once Zacharias's mouth was opened and his tongue loosed and he spoke, praising God."
42,1,65,"Awe fell on all their neighbors, and in the whole hill-country of Judaea all these matters were talked about."
42,1,66,"All who heard them laid them up in their minds, saying, What then will this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him."
42,1,67,"Zacharias, his father, was filled with the Holy Spirit and said prophetically:"
42,1,68,"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel! For he has looked upon his people, and made deliverance for them."
42,1,69,"He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David his servant,"
42,1,70,"As he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old,"
42,1,71,"Salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all those that hate us,"
42,1,72,"Dealing kindly with our forefathers, mindful of his holy covenant,"
42,1,73,"The oath which he swore to Abraham our father,"
42,1,74,"To grant that we, saved from the hands of our enemies, may serve him Without fear"
42,1,75,"in holiness and righteousness before him all our days."
42,1,76,"And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High. You will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,"
42,1,77,"To give the knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins,"
42,1,78,"Through the tender compassion of our God, With which the sunrise from on high will shine upon us;"
42,1,79,"To give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death, To guide our feet into the path of peace."
42,1,80,"The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he lived in the wilds until the day of his appearance before Israel."
42,2,1,"IN those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for the registration of the whole world."
42,2,2,"This first registration took place while Cyrenius was Governor of Syria."
42,2,3,"Everybody went to be registered \'97 each to his own city."
42,2,4,"Joseph went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,"
42,2,5,"to be registered with Mary who was betrothed to him, and was with child."
42,2,6,"While they were there, her time came"
42,2,7,"and she gave birth to her son, her first-born, and she wrapped him up and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn."
42,2,8,"There were shepherds in the same country staying in the fields and keeping watch over their flocks by night."
42,2,9,"Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them. They were much afraid,"
42,2,10,"but the angel said to them, Have no fear! Indeed, I am bringing you good news of a great joy which is to be for all the people;"
42,2,11,"for there was born for you to-day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ and Lord."
42,2,12,"This will be a sign for you: you will find the babe wrapped up and lying in a manger."
42,2,13,"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude from the army of heaven, praising God, and saying,"
42,2,14,"Glory in highest heaven to God, and peace on earth among men in whom he delights."
42,2,15,"When the angels went away into heaven, the shepherds spoke to one another: Let us go to Bethlehem and see this that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us."
42,2,16,"So they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger."
42,2,17,"When they saw it, they told what had been spoken to them about this child."
42,2,18,"All who heard it wondered at what was said to them by the shepherds."
42,2,19,"Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart."
42,2,20,"Then the shepherds went back glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as it had been told them."
42,2,21,"When eight days had passed and the time to circumcise him had come, his name was called Jesus \'97 the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb."
42,2,22,"When the days of their purification were completed, according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,"
42,2,23,"as it is written in the Law of the Lord, Every firstborn male shall be called holy to the Lord,"
42,2,24,"and to give an offering according to what is said in the law of the Lord, a pair of doves or two young pigeons."
42,2,25,"There was in Jerusalem a man named Simeon, and this man was upright and God-fearing, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him."
42,2,26,"It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he was not to see death before he saw the Lord's Christ."
42,2,27,"Led by the Spirit he came into the Temple courts, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus in order to do for him according to the custom of the law,"
42,2,28,"he took him into his arms and blessed God, and said,"
42,2,29,"Now, O Lord, thou art letting thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word."
42,2,30,"For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,"
42,2,31,"which thou hast prepared before the face of all the peoples,"
42,2,32,"a light for revelation to Gentiles and a glory to thy people Israel."
42,2,33,"His father and his mother wondered at the things that were spoken about him."
42,2,34,"Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, This child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel and for a sign much spoken against"
42,2,35,""
42,2,36,"And there was Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was far advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from her maidenhood"
42,2,37,"and having been a widow for now eighty-four years. She never left the Temple courts, but worshiped by fastings and prayers, night and day."
42,2,38,"She too came up at that time and praised God and spoke about him to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem."
42,2,39,"When they had completed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own city Nazareth."
42,2,40,"The child grew and became strong and was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him."
42,2,41,"His parents used to go up every year to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover."
42,2,42,"When he had reached the age of twelve years, and they had gone up according to the custom of the feast"
42,2,43,"and had completed the days and were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. But his parents did not know it."
42,2,44,"Thinking that he was in the company, they went a day's journey. But when they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances"
42,2,45,"and did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem searching for him."
42,2,46,"On the third day they found him in the Temple courts, sitting in the midst of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions."
42,2,47,"All who heard him were astonished at his understanding and his answers."
42,2,48,"When his parents saw him, they were amazed, and his mother said to him, Child, why have you treated us so? See, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress."
42,2,49,"He said to them,"
42,2,50,"They did not understand the words that he spoke."

42,3,2,"during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wild lands."
42,3,3,"Then he came into all the neighborhood of the Jordan proclaiming baptism for a change of heart in order to forgiveness of sins,"

42,3,8,"Produce then fruits suitable for a change of heart, and do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father.' For I tell you, God is able out of these stones to raise up children for Abraham."
42,3,9,"Already the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not yield good fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire."
42,3,10,"The crowds asked him, What then shall we do?"
42,3,11,"He answered, Let him who has two tunics give to him who has none, and let him who has food do likewise."
42,3,12,"Some tax collectors came to be baptized and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?"
42,3,13,"He said to them, Do nothing beyond what you are authorized."
42,3,14,"Soldiers asked him, And what shall we do? He said to them, Do violence to no man; bring no false accusations; be content with your rations."
42,3,15,"As the people were in expectation and all were debating in their minds about John, whether he was the Christ,"
42,3,16,"John said to them all, I am baptizing you with water, but there is coming the One mightier than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to unfasten. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire."
42,3,17,"He has his fan in his hand to cleanse his threshing floor and gather the wheat into his granary. But the chaff he will burn up with fire unquenchable."
42,3,18,"With many different exhortations John proclaimed the good news to the people."
42,3,19,"But Herod, the prince, because John reproved him regarding Herodias, his brother's wife, and regarding all the wicked things which Herod had done,"
42,3,20,"added also this wickedness to all the rest \'97 he shut up John in prison."
42,3,21,"When all the people were being baptized, and when Jesus had been baptized and was praying, heaven was opened,"
42,3,22,"and the Holy Spirit in bodily form like a dove descended upon him, and a voice came from heaven, Thou art my Son, the Beloved. In thee I delight."

42,4,30,"But he passed through the midst of them and went away."
42,4,31,"He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. There he was teaching them on the Sabbath,"

42,23,1,"THEN the whole assemblage arose and led him to Pilate."
42,23,2,"They began accusing him, saying, We have found this man corrupting our nation and opposing the payment of tribute to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ a king."
42,23,3,"Pilate asked him, Are you the king of the Jews? Jesus answered him,"
42,23,4,"Pilate said to the high priests and the crowd, I find nothing criminal in this man."

42,23,6,"Pilate, on hearing of Galilee, asked if the man was a Galilaean,"
42,23,7,"and when he learned that he was of Herod's jurisdiction he sent him to Herod, who was himself also in Jerusalem during those days."
42,23,8,"Herod on seeing Jesus was much pleased because for a long time he had been anxious to see him on account of hearing about him, and he was hoping to see some miracle done by him."
42,23,9,"He questioned him with many words; but Jesus gave him no answer."
42,23,10,"The high priests and the scribes stood and vehemently accused him."
42,23,11,"Herod along with his soldiers treated him with contempt and after making sport of him and putting a gorgeous robe on him, sent him back to Pilate."

42,23,23,"But they insisted with loud voices asking to have him crucified, and their voices prevailed."
42,23,24,"So Pilate gave sentence that what they asked should be done."
42,23,25,"He freed the man who for riot and murder had been thrown into prison \'97 the man they asked for; but Jesus he handed over to their will."
42,23,26,"As they led him away, they took hold of Simon, a Cyrenian coming from the country, and laid on him the cross to bear behind Jesus."

42,23,35,"The people stood looking on. The rulers scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen."
42,23,36,"The soldiers made sport of him, coming up and offering him sour wine"
42,23,37,"and saying, If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"
42,23,38,"There was a writing over him,"
42,23,39,"One of the criminals who were crucified insulted him, Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us."
42,23,40,"But the other rebuked him and said, Have you no fear of God, since you are under the same sentence?"
42,23,41,"And we are here justly, for we are receiving our due for our deeds. But this man has done nothing wrong."
42,23,42,"Then he said, Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
42,23,43,"Jesus said to him,"
42,23,44,"It was now about noon, and darkness came over all the land until three,"
42,23,45,"the sun being eclipsed. And the curtain in the Temple was torn in the middle."
42,23,46,"Then Jesus said in a loud voice,"
42,23,47,"When the Centurion saw what had happened, he gave glory to God, saying, Certainly this was an upright man!"
42,23,48,"And all the crowds that had stood by looking on the scene, after seeing what happened, turned away beating their breasts."
42,23,49,"All his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee were standing at a distance looking on."
42,23,50,"There was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man"
42,23,51,"who had not participated in their plan and action. He was of Arimathaea, a city of the Judaeans, and was looking for the kingdom of God."
42,23,52,"This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus."
42,23,53,"He took it down and wrapped it in fine linen and laid him in a tomb cut in the rock where no one was yet lying."
42,23,54,"It was the day of Preparation and the Sabbath was about to begin."
42,23,55,"The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed along and saw the tomb and how his body was laid,"
42,23,56,"and they went back and prepared perfumes and ointments. On the Sabbath they abstained from work according to the commandment."
42,24,1,"BUT on the first day of the week at early dawn they came to the tomb, bringing the perfumes which they had prepared."
42,24,2,"They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,"
42,24,3,"and on entering they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus."
42,24,4,"While they were at a loss about this, suddenly two men in glittering robes stood beside them."
42,24,5,"They were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, Why are you looking for the living among the dead?"
42,24,6,"He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you while he was still in Galilee"
42,24,7,"that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and rise on the third day."
42,24,8,"Then they remembered his words"
42,24,9,"and turned back from the tomb and told all this to the eleven and all the rest."
42,24,10,"It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them also told these things to the apostles."
42,24,11,"But these reports seemed in their eyes like idle talk. They did not believe the women."
42,24,12,"But Peter rose and ran to the tomb and stooping down he saw nothing but the linen cloths, and he went away to his place wondering at what had happened."
42,24,13,"On that day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, seven miles distant from Jerusalem,"
42,24,14,"and they were talking to each other about all these occurrences."
42,24,15,"It happened as they talked and discussed that Jesus himself drew near and walked along with them."
42,24,16,"But their eyes were restrained from recognizing him."
42,24,17,"He said to them,"
42,24,18,"One of them, named Cleopas, said to him, Are you a stranger living alone in Jerusalem and do you not know the things that have happened there in recent days?"
42,24,19,"He said to them,"
42,24,20,"how our high priests and leading men handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him."
42,24,21,"But we were hoping that he was the one who was to redeem Israel. But now, however, the third day is passing since these things took place."
42,24,22,"Yet some women from our company amazed us. They went at dawn to the tomb"
42,24,23,"and did not find his body, but came back saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive."
42,24,24,"Some of our company went out to the tomb and found things as the women had said, but they did not see him."
42,24,25,"Jesus said to them,"
42,24,26,""
42,24,27,"Then, beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things about himself."
42,24,28,"They drew near to the village where they were going and he acted as if he were going on."
42,24,29,"But they urged him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the sun is already low. So he went in to stay with them."
42,24,30,"As he reclined at table with them, he took the bread and blessed it and broke it and gave it to them."
42,24,31,"And their eyes were opened and they recognized him; but he vanished from their sight."
42,24,32,"They said to each other, Were not our hearts burning within us when he was talking to us on the road and was explaining the Scriptures to us?"
42,24,33,"Then, rising that very hour, they returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven and their associates assembled"
42,24,34,"and saying, Really the Lord has risen and he has appeared to Simon."
42,24,35,"They then narrated what had happened on the road and how they knew him by his breaking the bread."
42,24,36,"While they were talking of these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said to them,"
42,24,37,"They were terrified and much alarmed, and thought that they were seeing a spirit."
42,24,38,"But he said to them,"

42,24,40,"Saying this, he showed them his hands and his feet."

42,24,43,"and he took it and ate before them."
42,24,44,"He said to them,"

42,24,48,""
42,24,49,""
42,24,50,"He led them out as far as Bethany and lifted up his hands and blessed them."
42,24,51,"While he was blessing them he parted from them and was carried up into heaven."
42,24,52,"They bowed down before him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,"
42,24,53,"and were constantly in the Temple courts blessing God."
43,1,1,"IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
43,1,2,"He was in the beginning with God."
43,1,3,"All things came into being through him, and apart from him not one thing came into being that has come into being."
43,1,4,"In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men."
43,1,5,"And the Light shone in the darkness, but the darkness did not understand it."
43,1,6,"There came a man, sent from God. His name was John."
43,1,7,"He came for testimony, to testify about the Light, that all might believe through him."
43,1,8,"He was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light."
43,1,9,"The true Light, which enlightens every man, was coming into the world."
43,1,10,"He was in the world, and the world had come into being through him, yet the world did not know him."
43,1,11,"He came to his own things, but his own men did not receive him."
43,1,12,"All who received him \'97 to them he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name,"
43,1,13,"who were born not of blood nor of the will of flesh nor of the will of man, but of God."
43,1,14,"The Word became flesh and tented among us, and we looked upon his glory, glory as of an only son from a father, full of grace and truth."
43,1,15,"John bore witness to him and cried, This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has become before me, for he was before me.' "
43,1,16,"For of his fullness we all have received, and grace for grace."
43,1,17,"For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."
43,1,18,"No one has ever seen God; God the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has interpreted him."
43,1,19,"This is the testimony of John when the Jews of Jerusalem sent to him priests and Levites to ask him, Who are you?"
43,1,20,"He confessed and did not deny, but confessed, I am not the Christ."
43,1,21,"They asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? He said, I am not. Are you the prophet? He answered, No."
43,1,22,"They said then, Who are you? Let us have an answer to give to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
43,1,23,"He said, I am 'the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord,' as Isaiah the prophet said."
43,1,24,"The men had been sent from the Pharisees."
43,1,25,"They asked him, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet?"
43,1,26,"John answered them, I baptize with water. In the midst of you stands one whom you do not know \'97"
43,1,27,"the One who is coming after me \'97 for whom I am not worthy to loosen the strap of his sandal."
43,1,28,"This happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing."
43,1,29,"The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"
43,1,30,"This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who has become before me, for he was before me.'"
43,1,31,"I did not know him, but I knew that he was to be shown to Israel. For that reason I came baptizing with water."
43,1,32,"John bore witness, I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and it remained on him."
43,1,33,"I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water \'97 he said to me, 'He on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining, that is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'"
43,1,34,"And I saw it and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."
43,1,35,"Again on the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,"
43,1,36,"and, looking at Jesus as he walked, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God!"
43,1,37,"The two disciples heard him say this and they followed Jesus."
43,1,38,"Jesus turned and looked at them as they followed, and said to them,"
43,1,39,"He said to them,"
43,1,40,"Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two that heard about Jesus from John and followed him."
43,1,41,"He found first his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah"
43,1,42,"He led him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said,"
43,1,43,"On the next day Jesus decided to go away to Galilee, and he found Philip and said to him,"
43,1,44,"Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter."
43,1,45,"Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law and of whom the prophets wrote \'97 Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth."
43,1,46,"Nathanael said to him, From Nazareth can there be anything good? Philip said to him, Come and see."
43,1,47,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said,"
43,1,48,"Nathanael said to him, How do you know me? Jesus answered him,"
43,1,49,"Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel!"
43,1,50,"Jesus answered him,"
43,1,51,"He added,"
43,2,1,"ON the third day a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there."
43,2,2,"Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the wedding."
43,2,3,"When the wine ran short, Jesus' mother said to him, They have no wine."
43,2,4,"Jesus said to her,"
43,2,5,"His mother said to the servants, Whatever he tells you, do it."
43,2,6,"There were standing there six stone water jars in accordance with the Jewish custom of purification, holding about twenty or thirty gallons apiece."
43,2,7,"Jesus said to them,"
43,2,8,"Then he said to them,"
43,2,9,"and when the Master of the feast tasted the water that had become wine, not knowing where it came from \'97 though the servants who had dipped out the water knew \'97 he called to the bridegroom"
43,2,10,"and said to him, Every man sets on first the fine wine, and when they have drunk freely he sets on the poorer. You have kept the fine wine till now."
43,2,11,"This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana in Galilee and displayed his glory, and his disciples believed in him."
43,2,12,"After this Jesus went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and there they stayed a few days."
43,2,13,"The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
43,2,14,"Finding in the Temple courts the sellers of cattle and sheep and doves and the money-changers sitting there,"
43,2,15,"he made a whip of cords and drove them all from the courts \'97 all the sheep and the cattle, \'97 and he poured out the small coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables."
43,2,16,"He said to those who were selling doves,"
43,2,17,"His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for thy house will devour me."
43,2,18,"The Jews said to him, What sign do you show us, since you act in this way?"
43,2,19,"Jesus answered them,"
43,2,20,"The Jews said, It took forty-six years to build this Temple, and will you raise it in three days?"
43,2,21,"But he was speaking of the temple of his body."
43,2,22,"So when he arose from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken."
43,2,23,"When he was in Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover, many believed in his name, seeing his signs that he did,"
43,2,24,"but Jesus did not trust himself to them because he knew all men"
43,2,25,"and had no need for any one to inform him about man, for he knew what was in man."
43,3,1,"THERE was a man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus by name, a ruler of the Jews."
43,3,2,"This man came to Jesus one night and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that you are doing unless God is with him."
43,3,3,"Jesus answered,"
43,3,4,"Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter into his mother's womb a second time and be born?"
43,3,5,"Jesus answered,"

43,3,24,"For John had not yet been thrown into prison."
43,3,25,"There arose a dispute between the disciples of John and a Jew about purification."
43,3,26,"They came to John and said to him, Rabbi, the man who was with you across the Jordan to whom you bore testimony \'97 see, he is baptizing and all are coming to him."
43,3,27,"John answered, A man can assume nothing unless it has been given him from heaven."
43,3,28,"You yourselves are witnesses that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.'"
43,3,29,"He who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine is complete."

43,11,5,"Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus."
43,11,6,"So when he heard that he was sick, he stayed where he was two days."
43,11,7,"Then, after that, he said to the disciples,"
43,11,8,"The disciples said to him, Rabbi, just now the Jews were trying to stone you, and are you going there again?"
43,11,9,"Jesus answered,"
43,11,10,""
43,11,11,"He said this, and then he said to them,"
43,11,12,"The disciples said to him, Master, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."
43,11,13,"But Jesus had spoken of his death. They thought that he was speaking of the repose of sleep."

43,11,16,"Thomas, who is called Didymus"
43,11,17,"When Jesus came he found that Lazarus had been already four days in the tomb."

43,11,19,"and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them regarding their brother."
43,11,20,"When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him. Mary was sitting in the house."
43,11,21,"Martha said to Jesus, Master, if you had been here my brother would not have died."
43,11,22,"And now I know that whatever you ask God for, God will give you."
43,11,23,"Jesus said to her,"
43,11,24,"Martha said to him, I know that he will rise at the resurrection on the last day."
43,11,25,"Jesus said to her,"
43,11,26,""
43,11,27,"She said to him, Yes, Master. I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."
43,11,28,"Having said this, she went away and called Mary her sister, saying to her privately, The Teacher is here and is asking for you."
43,11,29,"She, when she heard it, rose quickly and went to meet him."
43,11,30,"Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him."
43,11,31,"The Jews who were with Mary in the house trying to comfort her, seeing her rise quickly and go out, followed thinking that she was going to the tomb to wail there."
43,11,32,"When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying, Master, if you had been here my brother would not have died."
43,11,33,"When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her weeping, he was indignant in spirit and disturbed,"
43,11,34,"and said,"
43,11,35,"Jesus wept."
43,11,36,"The Jews said, See, how he loved him!"
43,11,37,"Some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have prevented this man from dying?"
43,11,38,"Jesus, again indignant, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying on the entrance."
43,11,39,"Jesus said,"
43,11,40,"Jesus said to her,"
43,11,41,"So they took away the stone. Jesus lifted up his eyes and said,"
43,11,42,""
43,11,43,"After saying this he called in a loud voice,"
43,11,44,"Forth came the dead man, swathed feet and hands in grave-clothes and his face bound up in a handkerchief. Jesus said,"
43,11,45,"Many of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did believed in him."
43,11,46,"But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done."
43,11,47,"So the high priests and the Pharisees assembled the Council and said, What are we doing? for this man is doing many signs."
43,11,48,"If we let him alone in this way, all will believe in him and the Romans will come and destroy our place and nation."
43,11,49,"One of them, Caiaphas, who was High Priest that year, said to them, You do not know anything"
43,11,50,"nor do you reason that it is better for you that one man should die for the people and so the whole nation escape destruction."
43,11,51,"He did not say this of himself, but being High Priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation,"
43,11,52,"and not for the nation only, but to gather into one the children of God now scattered far and wide."
43,11,53,"From that day they plotted to kill him."
43,11,54,"So Jesus no more walked about openly among the Jews, but went away from there into the country near the wild lands, to a city called Ephraim, and there he stayed with his disciples."
43,11,55,"The Passover of the Jews was near and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover to purify themselves."
43,11,56,"They were looking for Jesus and were saying to one another, as they stood in the Temple courts, What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?"
43,11,57,"The high priests and the Pharisees had given orders that, if any one knew where he was, he should report it so that they might arrest him."
43,12,1,"SIX days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was whom he had raised from the dead."
43,12,2,"There they made a dinner for him. Martha waited on them, and Lazarus was one of those who reclined at table with him."
43,12,3,"Mary took a pound of pure nard perfume, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume."
43,12,4,"Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one who was going to betray him, said,"
43,12,5,"Why was not this perfume sold for three hundred shillings and the money given to the poor?"
43,12,6,"He said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and having the purse used to pilfer what was put into it."
43,12,7,"Jesus said,"
43,12,8,""
43,12,9,"A great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not on account of Jesus alone, but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead."
43,12,10,"The high priests planned to kill Lazarus too,"
43,12,11,"because many of the Jews on account of him went and believed in Jesus."
43,12,12,"On the next day the great crowd which had come to the feast, hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,"
43,12,13,"took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting, God save him! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord \'97 the King of Israel!"
43,12,14,"Jesus, finding a young ass, sat on it, as it is written,"
43,12,15,"Fear not, daughter of Zion! Behold, your King comes, sitting on the foal of an ass!"
43,12,16,"These things his disciples did not understand at first, but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written of him and had been done to him."
43,12,17,"The people that were with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead were bearing witness to it."
43,12,18,"For this reason the crowd went to meet him, because they had heard that he had done this sign."
43,12,19,"The Pharisees said among themselves, You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone off after him."
43,12,20,"There were some Greeks among those who had come up to worship at the feast."
43,12,21,"These came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, Sir, we wish to see Jesus."
43,12,22,"Philip came and told Andrew. Andrew came with Philip and they told Jesus."

43,12,33,"This he said indicating by what death he was to die."

43,12,39,"For this reason they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,"
43,12,40,"He has blinded their eyes and dulled their mind so that they may not see with their eyes nor understand with their mind and repent so that I should heal them."
43,12,41,"Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and he spoke of him."
43,12,42,"Nevertheless, even of the rulers many did believe in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, in order not to be expelled from the synagogue;"

43,19,11,"Jesus answered,"
43,19,12,"After this, Pilate kept trying to release him, but the Jews shouted, If you let this man go you are not a friend of Caesar. Every one who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar."
43,19,13,"Pilate, on hearing these words, brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat in the place called the Mosaic Pavement \'97 in Hebrew, Gabbatha."
43,19,14,"It was the Preparation Day of the Passover, about noon. He said to the Jews, See your king!"
43,19,15,"They shouted, Away with him, away with him! Crucify him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your king? The high priests answered, We have no king but Caesar."

43,19,17,"and laid on him his cross and went out to what is called Skull Place \'97 in Hebrew, Golgotha \'97"
43,19,18,"where they crucified him. And with him they crucified two others, one on this side and one on that, and Jesus between them."
43,19,19,"Pilate wrote a sign and put it up on the cross. It was written:"
43,19,20,"Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek."
43,19,21,"The high priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'This man said, I am King of the Jews.' "
43,19,22,"Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written."
43,19,23,"The soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothes and made four parts, a part to each soldier, and there was his tunic besides. The tunic was seamless, woven from the top entire."
43,19,24,"They said to one another, Let us not tear it, but cast lots who shall have it. This was so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, They parted my garments among them and on my clothing they cast lots. The soldiers did this."
43,19,25,"There were standing beside the cross of Jesus his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene."
43,19,26,"When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother,"
43,19,27,"Then he said to the disciple,"
43,19,28,"After this, Jesus knowing that now all things had been completed, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled said,"
43,19,29,"A pitcher was standing there full of sour wine. Putting a sponge full of sour wine on a hyssop stem, they raised it to his mouth."
43,19,30,"When Jesus had taken the sour wine, he said,"
43,19,31,"The Jews, because it was Preparation Day, in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for that Sabbath was a great day, requested Pilate to have their legs broken to kill them."
43,19,32,"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with him."
43,19,33,"But, coming to Jesus, when they saw him already dead, they did not break his legs."
43,19,34,"But one of the soldiers with his spear pierced his side and immediately there came forth blood and water."
43,19,35,"He who saw it has borne witness and his witness is true, and he knows that he speaks the truth in order that you may believe."
43,19,36,"For this happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken."
43,19,37,"And again another Scripture says, They will look on him whom they have pierced."
43,19,38,"After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate permission to carry away the body of Jesus, and Pilate granted it. So he came and carried his body away."
43,19,39,"Nicodemus, the man who came to him at first by night, came also bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight."
43,19,40,"They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the custom of the Jews in preparing for burial."
43,19,41,"There was in the place where he had been crucified a garden and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had been laid."
43,19,42,"There, on account of the Preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus."
43,20,1,"ON the first day of the week, early in the morning while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been taken from the tomb."
43,20,2,"She ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the Master from the tomb and we do not know where they have laid him."
43,20,3,"Simon Peter and the other disciple went out and made their way to the tomb."
43,20,4,"They were both running, and the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the tomb,"
43,20,5,"and stooping he saw the linen cloths lying; but he did not enter."
43,20,6,"Simon Peter came following him and entered the tomb and looked at the linen cloths lying"
43,20,7,"and the handkerchief that had been about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place apart."
43,20,8,"Then the other disciple who had come first to the tomb entered, and he saw and believed."
43,20,9,"For they did not yet know the Scripture that he must rise from the dead."
43,20,10,"Then the disciples went back to where they were staying."
43,20,11,"Mary was standing by the tomb outside weeping. As she wept she stooped and looked into the tomb"
43,20,12,"and saw two angels in white sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain."
43,20,13,"They said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have carried away my Master and I do not know where they have laid him."
43,20,14,"After saying this, she turned and saw Jesus standing, but did not recognize that it was Jesus."
43,20,15,"Jesus said to her,"
43,20,16,"Jesus said to her,"
43,20,17,"Jesus said to her,"
43,20,18,"Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, I have seen the Master, and she told that he had said these things to her."
43,20,19,"In the evening of that day, the first day of the week, when the doors had been closed where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them,"
43,20,20,"When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy on seeing the Master."
43,20,21,"He said to them again,"
43,20,22,"When he had said this, he breathed on them and said,"
43,20,23,""
43,20,24,"Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus"
43,20,25,"The other disciples said to him, We have seen the Master. But he said to them, Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it."
43,20,26,"After eight days the disciples were again within and Thomas was with them. Jesus came and stood in the midst and said,"
43,20,27,"Then he said to Thomas,"
43,20,28,"Thomas answered him, My Lord and my God!"
43,20,29,"Jesus said to him,"
43,20,30,"Jesus did before the disciples many other signs which are not written in this book."
43,20,31,"But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life through his name."
43,21,1,"AFTER this, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Lake of Tiberias. He showed himself in this way."
43,21,2,"There were together Simon Peter and Thomas, called Didymus"
43,21,3,"Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said, We will go along with you. They went out and got into a boat, but that night they caught nothing."
43,21,4,"When day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach. The disciples, however, did not recognize that it was Jesus."
43,21,5,"Jesus said to them,"
43,21,6,"He said to them,"
43,21,7,"That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Master! Simon Peter, on hearing that it was the Master, girded around him his blouse, for he was naked, and threw himself into the lake."
43,21,8,"The other disciples came in the small boat, for they were not far from land \'97 about a hundred yards \'97 dragging the netful of fish."
43,21,9,"When they had gotten out on land, they saw a fire of coals and fish laid on it and bread."
43,21,10,"Jesus said to them,"
43,21,11,"Simon Peter got into the boat and drew the net to land full of big fishes \'97 a hundred and fifty-three \'97 and though there were so many the net was not torn."
43,21,12,"Jesus said,"
43,21,13,"Jesus came and took bread and gave to them, and fish in the same manner."
43,21,14,"This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after rising from the dead."
43,21,15,"When they had breakfasted, Jesus said to Simon Peter,"
43,21,16,"He said to him a second time,"
43,21,17,"He said to him the third time,"
43,21,18,""
43,21,19,"This he said, indicating the kind of death by which he would glorify God. After saying this he said to him,"
43,21,20,"Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved, following."
43,21,21,"Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, Master, what shall this man do?"
43,21,22,"Jesus said to him,"
43,21,23,"So the report went out among the brethren that that disciple was not to die. But Jesus did not say to Peter that he would not die, but,"
43,21,24,"This is the disciple who witnesses to these things and who wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true."
43,21,25,"There are also many other things that Jesus did, but if these are written, every one, I do not think that the world itself will have room for the books when written."
44,1,1,"IN my first book, Theophilus, I told of all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning"
44,1,2,"down to the day when, after giving commands, through the Holy Spirit, to the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up to heaven."
44,1,3,"By many proofs he revealed himself to these men as still alive after his sufferings; for he was seen by them for forty days and spoke of things relating to the kingdom of God."
44,1,4,"Also while eating with them, he charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father,"
44,1,5,""
44,1,6,"When they came together, they asked him, Master, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"
44,1,7,"He said to them,"
44,1,8,""
44,1,9,"He said this and then, while they were looking on, he was taken up and a cloud lifted him from their sight."
44,1,10,"They were gazing into the sky as he went, when suddenly two men in white robes were standing beside them"
44,1,11,"and said, Men of Galilee, why are you standing and looking up into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way that you have seen him go into heaven."
44,1,12,"They then returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called the Olive Orchard, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey distant."
44,1,13,"When they came into the city, they went up to the upper room where they were staying. There were Peter and John, and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James."
44,1,14,"All of these continued earnestly and unitedly in prayer with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers."
44,1,15,"In those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren"
44,1,16,"Brethren, it was necessary that the Scripture should be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became guide to those who arrested Jesus."
44,1,17,"For he was numbered among us and received a share in this service."
44,1,18,"(This man bought a piece of land with the price of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst asunder and all his entrails were poured out."
44,1,19,"It became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, the Field of Blood.)"
44,1,20,"For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'Let his dwelling become desolate and let there be no one living in it,' and, 'His overseership let another take.'"
44,1,21,"It is needful, therefore, that of the men who have been with us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,"
44,1,22,"from the baptism of John down to the day that he was taken up from us \'97 that one of these should become a witness with us of his resurrection."
44,1,23,"So they put forward two, Joseph who is called Barsabbas, surnamed Justus, and Matthias."
44,1,24,"In prayer they said, O Lord, thou who knowest the hearts of all, show which one of these two thou has chosen"
44,1,25,"to take the place in this service and apostleship which Judas deserted to go to his own place."
44,1,26,"Then they cast lots between them. The lot fell on Matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles."
44,2,1,"DURING the course of the day of Pentecost they were all together in the same place,"
44,2,2,"when suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of a strong rushing wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting."
44,2,3,"Then there appeared to them, as it were, tongues of flame distributing themselves, and one rested on each of them."
44,2,4,"They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in foreign tongues, as the Spirit gave them power of expression."
44,2,5,"There were Jews living in Jerusalem, pious men from every nation under heaven."
44,2,6,"When this sound was heard, the crowd came together and were astonished because each one heard them speaking in his own language."
44,2,7,"They were amazed and, wondering, said, Are not all these who are talking, Galilaean?"
44,2,8,"How then does each of us hear them in his own native language?"
44,2,9,"Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those who live in Mesopotamia, Judas and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,"
44,2,10,"Phrygia and Pamphilia, Egypt and the regions of Libya toward Cyrene, visitors from Rome, Jews and proselytes,"
44,2,11,"Cretans and Arabians \'97 we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of God."
44,2,12,"They were all astonished and at a loss, one saying to another, What does this mean?"
44,2,13,"Some scoffingly said, They are full of sweet wine."
44,2,14,"But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them: Fellow Jews, and all of you who live in Jerusalem, understand this and listen to my words."
44,2,15,"These are not drunk, as you assume, for it is only nine o'clock in the morning;"
44,2,16,"but this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:"
44,2,17,"'It will be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all mankind, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams."
44,2,18,"Yes, upon the slave men and slave girls that are mine I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy."
44,2,19,"I will give portents in heaven above and signs on the earth beneath, blood and fire and vapor of smoke."
44,2,20,"The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the day of the Lord comes \'97 that great and glorious day."
44,2,21,"And every one who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'"
44,2,22,"Fellow Israelites, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene was a man proved to be sent to you from God by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did through him in the midst of you, as you yourselves know."
44,2,23,"But when he had been delivered up according to the fixed purpose and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed him through the hands of lawless men."
44,2,24,"But God freed him from the pangs of death and raised him up, since it was impossible that he should be held under the power of death."
44,2,25,"For David says of him, 'I saw the Lord always before my face, for he is at my right hand so that I may not be cast down."
44,2,26,"Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices, and my flesh still dwells in hope"
44,2,27,"that thou wilt not leave my soul to Hades and wilt not let thy holy one see decay."
44,2,28,"Thou makest me know the paths of life. Thou wilt fill me with joy in thy presence.'"
44,2,29,"Brethren, allow me to say frankly to you regarding the patriarch David that he died and was buried and his tomb is among us to this day."
44,2,30,"But being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn to him an oath to place a descendant of his body upon his throne,"
44,2,31,"he foreseeing spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, saying that he was not left to Hades and that his flesh did not see decay."
44,2,32,"This Jesus, God raised up, and all of us are witnesses of it."
44,2,33,"Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you see and hear."
44,2,34,"For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says, 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,"
44,2,35,"till I make your enemies your footstool.'"
44,2,36,"Let all the house of Israel know surely that this Jesus, whom you crucified, God has made both Lord and Christ."
44,2,37,"Hearing this they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, What shall we do, brethren?"
44,2,38,"Peter said to them, Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."
44,2,39,"For the promise belongs to you and to your children and to all those who are far off, as many as the Lord your God may call."
44,2,40,"With many other words he bore witness and exhorted them, Save yourselves from this perverse generation."
44,2,41,"Those who accepted his message were baptized, and there were added on that day about three thousand souls."
44,2,42,"These gave constant attention to the teaching of the apostles and to the fellowship and the breaking of bread and the prayers."
44,2,43,"Awe came on every soul. Many wonders and signs were done by the apostles."
44,2,44,"All who believed had all things together in common."
44,2,45,"They would sell their lands and goods and distribute to all as any one had need."
44,2,46,"Every day, continuing with one accord in the Temple courts and in breaking bread from house to house, they ate together in joy and simplicity of heart,"
44,2,47,"praising God and having favor with all the people. The Lord added daily to their number those who were being saved."
44,3,1,"PETER and John were going up into the Temple courts at the hour of prayer, three o'clock,"
44,3,2,"when a man lame from his birth was being carried along. This man used to be placed every day near the gate of the Temple courts \'97 the one called the Beautiful Gate \'97 to beg of those who were entering."
44,3,3,"Seeing Peter and John about to go into the Temple courts, he begged to receive something."
44,3,4,"But Peter fixing his eyes on him, along with John, said, Look at us."
44,3,5,"He gave attention to them, expecting to receive something from them."
44,3,6,"But Peter said, Silver and gold I have not; but what I have I will give you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk."
44,3,7,"Grasping his right hand he lifted him up. Immediately his feet and ankles became strong,"
44,3,8,"and he sprang up and stood and walked and entered the Temple court with them, walking and leaping and praising God."
44,3,9,"All the people saw him walking about and praising God,"
44,3,10,"and when they recognized that it was he who had sat begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple court, they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him."
44,3,11,"While he still clung to Peter and John, all the people ran crowding around them in what was called Solomon's Colonnade, greatly astonished."
44,3,12,"Peter, seeing the people, explained, Fellow Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you gaze so at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk?"
44,3,13,"The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus whom you delivered up and disowned before Pilate when he had decided to release him."
44,3,14,"You disowned the holy and righteous one and begged to have a murderer granted you."
44,3,15,"You killed the Author of life, but God raised him from the dead. Of this we are witnesses."
44,3,16,"And now by faith in his name this man whom you see and know has been made strong by his name, and the faith that is through him has given this man this perfect soundness before you all."
44,3,17,"Now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, as also your rulers did."
44,3,18,"God in this way fulfilled what he had predicted through the mouths of all the prophets that his Christ should suffer."
44,3,19,"Therefore, repent and turn about, that your sins may be wiped away and the gracious face of the Lord may bring times of refreshing,"
44,3,20,"and he may send Jesus Christ, long ago appointed,"
44,3,21,"but whom heaven must receive until the times of the restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouths of his holy prophets of old."
44,3,22,"Moses indeed said, 'The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet from among your brethren, as he raised me; listen to all that he may say to you."
44,3,23,"It shall be that every person who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.'"
44,3,24,"And all the prophets, Samuel and those who followed him, all who spoke, also foretold these days."
44,3,25,"You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God established with your fathers when he said to Abraham, 'In your descendants all the families of the earth will be blessed.'"
44,3,26,"To you first God, when he raised up his servant, sent him, to bless you by turning each one of you from his wicked ways."
44,4,1,"WHILE they were speaking to the people, the priests and the commandant of the Temple and the Sadducees came upon them,"
44,4,2,"being offended because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in the case of Jesus the resurrection from the dead."
44,4,3,"They laid hands on them and placed them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening."
44,4,4,"But many of those who had heard the message believed, and the number of the men grew to be about five thousand."
44,4,5,"On the next day there was a gathering of their rulers and elders and scribes in Jerusalem,"
44,4,6,"with Annas the High Priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and all who were of high priestly race."
44,4,7,"They placed the apostles in the midst and asked them, By what power and in what name did you do this?"
44,4,8,"Then Peter, full of the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders,"
44,4,9,"if we must answer to-day regarding a benefit done to an infirm man, by what name he has been healed,"
44,4,10,"be it known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead \'97 by this name, this man stands here before you sound."
44,4,11,"This is the stone which was despised by you the builders, and which has become the corner stone."
44,4,12,"Nor is there salvation in any other. For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."
44,4,13,"Observing the fearless outspokenness of Peter and John and perceiving that they were common, uneducated men, they were astonished, and they recognized them as former companions of Jesus."
44,4,14,"Seeing the man who had been healed standing there with the apostles, they had nothing to say in opposition."
44,4,15,"After ordering them to go out of the council, they conferred together,"
44,4,16,"saying, What shall we do to these men? For that a notable miracle has been done by them is plain to all who live in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it."
44,4,17,"But that it may not spread further among the people, let us sternly forbid them to speak any longer in this name to any one."
44,4,18,"So, calling them in, they commanded them absolutely not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus."
44,4,19,"But Peter and John answered them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves."
44,4,20,"We, for our part, cannot refrain from saying what we have seen and heard."
44,4,21,"The Council after further threats set them at liberty, not finding any way to punish them on account of the people; for all were giving glory to God because of what had happened."
44,4,22,"For the man upon whom this miracle of healing had been performed was more than forty years old."
44,4,23,"The apostles upon being released came to their friends and told them all that the high priests and the elders had said."
44,4,24,"They hearing it unitedly lifted up their prayer to God and said, O Lord, thou who didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things that are in them,"
44,4,25,"who through the Holy Spirit by the mouth of our father David, thy servant, didst say, 'Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things?"
44,4,26,"The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers are gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ' \'97"
44,4,27,"for truly in this city Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered against thy holy servant Jesus,"
44,4,28,"to do all that thy hands and thy will had predetermined should take place \'97"
44,4,29,"now, Lord, look upon their threats and enable thy servants to speak thy message with all fearlessness,"
44,4,30,"while thou dost stretch out thine hand for healing and while signs and wonders are done through the name of thy holy servant Jesus."
44,4,31,"After this prayer the place in which they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the message of God with courageous freedom."
44,4,32,"The multitude of those who had believed was of one heart and one soul, and no one said that any part of his property was his own, but they had all things in common."
44,4,33,"With great power the apostles continued to bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Great grace was upon them all."
44,4,34,"Nor was any one in need among them, for all who were owners of lands or houses would sell them and bring the money for what had been sold"
44,4,35,"and lay it at the apostles' feet, and it would be distributed to each as he had need."
44,4,36,"Joseph, to whom the apostles had given the name Barnabas, which means Son of Encouragement, a Levite born in Cyprus,"
44,4,37,"being the owner of a farm, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet."
44,5,1,"BUT a man called Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of property"
44,5,2,"and kept back a part of the price, with his wife's connivance, and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles' feet."
44,5,3,"Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the price of the land?"
44,5,4,"While you had it, was it not yours? And after it was sold, was it not at your own disposal? Why have you conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God."
44,5,5,"When Ananias heard these words he fell down and died. Great fear came upon all who heard these words."
44,5,6,"Then the young men arose and wrapped him in a shroud and carried him out and buried him."
44,5,7,"After an interval of about three hours, Ananias' wife came in, not knowing what had happened."
44,5,8,"Peter asked her, Tell me, did you sell the land for so much? She answered, Yes, for so much."
44,5,9,"Peter said to her, Why was it agreed between you to test the Spirit of the Lord? Even now the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."
44,5,10,"Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. The young men came in and found her dead, and carried her out and buried her beside her husband."
44,5,11,"Great awe came upon the whole church and upon all who heard these things."
44,5,12,"Many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles. They were all with one purpose in Solomon's Colonnade."
44,5,13,"Of the rest no one dared join them, but the people honored them highly."
44,5,14,"Believers in the Lord were more and more being added, crowds both of men and of women,"
44,5,15,"so that they carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on couches and pallets with the hope that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some one of them."
44,5,16,"A crowd was coming too from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were troubled by impure spirits, and these were all being healed."
44,5,17,"But the High Priest and all his party \'97 the sect of the Sadducees \'97 became aroused and filled with indignation,"
44,5,18,"and laid hands on the apostles and put them into the public jail."
44,5,19,"But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors in the night and led them out and said,"
44,5,20,"Go, stand and speak to the people in the Temple courts all the words of this life."
44,5,21,"On hearing this they went into the Temple courts about daybreak and began teaching. When the High Priest and his party arrived, they called together the Council and all the eldership of the children of Israel and sent to the jail to have the men brought."
44,5,22,"But when the officers came there they did not find them in the prison. They returned and reported,"
44,5,23,"We found the prison shut with all security and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened we found no one inside."
44,5,24,"On hearing these words the commandant of the Temple and the high priests were at a loss as to what this would grow into."
44,5,25,"Then some one came and told them, The men whom you put in jail are standing in the Temple courts and teaching the people."
44,5,26,"Then the commandant with his subordinates went and brought them, but without violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people."
44,5,27,"They brought them in and made them stand before the Council. The High Priest asked them,"
44,5,28,"Did we not strictly order you not to teach in this name? And here you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and want to bring this man's blood on us."
44,5,29,"Peter, answering for the apostles, said, God must be obeyed rather than men."
44,5,30,"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you had killed by hanging him on a cross."
44,5,31,"God has exalted him as Leader and Savior at his own right hand to give to Israel change of heart and forgiveness of sins."
44,5,32,"We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit which God has given to those who obey him."
44,5,33,"On hearing this they became furious and wanted to kill them."
44,5,34,"But a certain Pharisee named Gamaliel \'97 a teacher of the law honored by all the people \'97 arose in the Council and, after directing that the men should be taken outside for a little while,"
44,5,35,"said, Men of Israel, consider carefully what you are going to do to these men."
44,5,36,"For before these days arose Theudas, professing to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves to him. But he was slain and all who followed him were scattered and came to naught."
44,5,37,"After him arose Judas the Galilean, in the days of the Census, and led away people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered."
44,5,38,"And now I advise you to keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or work is of men it will collapse,"
44,5,39,"but if it is of God you will not be able to suppress them. You might even be found to be fighting against God."
44,5,40,"They were persuaded by him. So they called in the apostles and gave them a flogging and ordered them not to go on speaking in the name of Jesus, and then set them at liberty;"
44,5,41,"but they went away from before the Council rejoicing because they were thought worthy to be put to shame for the Name."
44,5,42,"And every day in the Temple courts and from house to house they unceasingly taught and told the good news of Jesus the Christ."
44,6,1,"IN those days, when the number of disciples was increasing, the Greek-speaking Jews began to grumble at the Hebrew Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily service."
44,6,2,"Then the twelve called the body of disciples together and said, We do not wish to leave the message of God and wait on tables."
44,6,3,"Therefore, brethren, pick out seven men from among you, men of reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, and we will appoint them to look after this need."
44,6,4,"But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the service of the message."
44,6,5,"This proposal pleased the whole body. So they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch."
44,6,6,"These they presented before the apostles, who after prayer laid their hands upon them."
44,6,7,"The message of God continued to spread and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem increased greatly, and even a great body of the priests were obedient to the faith."
44,6,8,"Stephen, full of grace and of power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people."
44,6,9,"But certain persons from what was called the synagogue of the Libyans and Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen;"
44,6,10,"yet they could not hold their own against the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke."
44,6,11,"Then they got some men to say, We have heard him speaking profane words against Moses and against God."
44,6,12,"They excited the people and the elders and the scribes, and coming suddenly upon Stephen they arrested him and led him to the Council."
44,6,13,"There they put forward false witnesses who said, This man never ceases saying things against this holy place and the law."
44,6,14,"We have heard him say that this Jesus, the Nazarene, will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses handed down to us."
44,6,15,"All who were sitting in the Council as they looked at him saw that his face was like the face of an angel."
44,7,1,"THE High Priest said, Are these things true?"
44,7,2,"Stephen said: Brethren and Fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,"
44,7,3,"and said to him, 'Leave your land and your kindred and go into whatever land I shall show you.'"
44,7,4,"Then he came out from the land of the Chaldaeans and settled in Haran. From there, after the death of his father, God removed him into this land in which you now live,"
44,7,5,"but he did not give him any inheritance in it, not even a foot of it. Still he promised to give it as a possession to him and to his descendants after him, though at that time he had no child."
44,7,6,"God spoke thus, 'His descendants will sojourn in a land not their own, and they will be enslaved and maltreated four hundred years.'"
44,7,7,"And God said, 'That nation by which they are enslaved I will judge, and after that they shall come out and serve me in this place.'"
44,7,8,"God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. So Abraham circumcised his son Isaac on the eighth day, and Isaac circumcised his son Jacob, and Jacob circumcised his sons, the twelve patriarchs."
44,7,9,"The patriarchs becoming jealous of Joseph sold him into Egypt. But God was with him"
44,7,10,"and delivered him out of all his trials, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him governor over the land of Egypt and all his own house."
44,7,11,"Then there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great distress, and our fathers found no food."
44,7,12,"When Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt he sent our fathers the first time."
44,7,13,"On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family was made known to Pharaoh."
44,7,14,"Then Joseph sent and invited down Jacob his father and all his relatives, seventy-five persons,"
44,7,15,"and Jacob went down into Egypt and died there \'97 he and our fathers."
44,7,16,"They were brought to Shechem and buried in the tomb which Abraham bought for a price in silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem."
44,7,17,"As the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise which God had made to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt"
44,7,18,"until there arose to rule over Egypt a different king, who did not know Joseph."
44,7,19,"He adopted a crafty policy toward our race and oppressed our fathers, forcing them to expose their babes so that they should not be kept alive."
44,7,20,"At that time Moses was born, and was beautiful in God's sight. For three months he was cared for in his father's house."
44,7,21,"When he had been exposed, Pharaoh's daughter took him up and reared him as her own son."
44,7,22,"Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was strong in words and in deeds."
44,7,23,"When he reached the age of forty years it came into his heart to look after his brethren, the children of Israel."
44,7,24,"Seeing one of them being wronged, he defended him and did justice for the injured man by striking down the Egyptian."
44,7,25,"He thought that his brethren knew that God would give them freedom through his hand. But they did not understand it."
44,7,26,"On the next day Moses appeared when two of them were fighting, and tried to make peace between them, saying, 'Men, you are brethren. Why are you injuring each other?'"
44,7,27,"But he who was injuring his neighbor pushed him away, saying, 'Who appointed you a ruler and judge over us?"
44,7,28,"Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'"
44,7,29,"At that word Moses fled and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, and there he had two sons."
44,7,30,"When forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the desert of Mount Sinai in the flames of a burning bush."
44,7,31,"When Moses saw the sight he was astonished, but as he was approaching to look closely, the voice of the Lord was heard,"
44,7,32,"'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.' Then Moses trembled and did not dare to look closely."
44,7,33,"The Lord said to him, 'Loose your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground."
44,7,34,"I have plainly seen the distress of my people in Egypt and I have heard their groans and have come down to deliver them. Come now and I will send you to Egypt.'"
44,7,35,"This Moses whom they disowned, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and judge?' \'97 this man God sent as ruler and deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush."
44,7,36,"This man led them out, doing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years."
44,7,37,"This is the Moses who said, 'God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brethren.'"
44,7,38,"This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him in Mount Sinai and with our fathers, and he received the living words to give to us."
44,7,39,"Our fathers would not obey him, but thrust him away and turned back in their hearts toward Egypt,"
44,7,40,"saying to Aaron, 'Make us gods to lead us; for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt \'97 we do not know what has become of him.'"
44,7,41,"And they made the image of a calf in those days and brought sacrifices to the idol and rejoiced in the work of their own hands."
44,7,42,"So God turned and gave them up to worship the stars of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets, 'Did you offer to me slaughtered animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?"
44,7,43,"No, you carried the tent of Moloch and the star of the god Rephan, the images that you made for worship. Therefore I will remove you beyond Babylon.'"
44,7,44,"In the wilderness our fathers had the Tent of the Testimony made as he who spoke to Moses directed, according to the model which he had seen."
44,7,45,"This Tent our fathers who were with Joshua received in their turn and brought into the land of the nations whom God drove out from before our fathers, and it remained until the days of David."
44,7,46,"He found favor with God and prayed that he might provide a temple for the house of Israel."
44,7,47,"But Solomon built for him a house."
44,7,48,"Yet the Most High does not dwell in buildings made by hands; as the prophet says,"
44,7,49,"'Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool. What sort of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is my place of rest?"
44,7,50,"Did not my hand make all these things?'"
44,7,51,"You stiff-necked men, uncircumcised in hearts and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit! As your fathers did, so do you."
44,7,52,"Which one of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? Yes, they killed those who announced in advance the coming of the righteous one of whom now you have become the betrayers and murderers \'97"
44,7,53,"you who received the law as it was transmitted by angels and have not kept it."
44,7,54,"As they listened to these things they were cut to the heart and ground their teeth at him."
44,7,55,"But he being full of the Holy Spirit looked up into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at God's right hand,"
44,7,56,"and he said, I see heaven opened and the Son of Man standing at God's right hand!"
44,7,57,"With a great shout they stopped their ears and rushed upon him with one purpose,"
44,7,58,"and hurried him out of the city and stoned him. The witnesses laid down their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul."
44,7,59,"They stoned Stephen as he was praying and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
44,7,60,"Kneeling he cried aloud, Lord, do not lay up this sin against them! After saying this he fell asleep."
44,8,1,"SAUL also approved of their putting him to death. On that day arose a great persecution of the church in Jerusalem. All except the apostles were scattered through Judaea and Samaria."
44,8,2,"Pious men carried Stephen away for burial and made great lamentation over him."
44,8,3,"Saul cruelly hounded the church from house to house, entering and dragging out men and women and handing them over into prison."
44,8,4,"Those who were scattered went to various places telling the good news."
44,8,5,"Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them."
44,8,6,"The crowds with one mind gave attention to what was said by Philip, listening to his words and seeing the signs that he did."
44,8,7,"For impure spirits came out shrieking from many who had been possessed, and many paralytic and lame people were healed."
44,8,8,"There was great rejoicing in that city."
44,8,9,"A certain man named Simon had previously been practicing magic in the city and astonishing the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one."
44,8,10,"They had all given attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the power of God which is called great."
44,8,11,"They had given attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them by his magic."
44,8,12,"But when they believed Philip, who was telling the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women."
44,8,13,"Simon himself also believed and was baptized and attached himself to Philip, and seeing the signs and great miracles that took place he was astonished."
44,8,14,"When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the message of God, they sent to them Peter and John."
44,8,15,"They on arrival prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit."
44,8,16,"For the Spirit had not yet fallen on any one of them; they had merely been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,8,17,"Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit."
44,8,18,"When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,"
44,8,19,"saying, Give to me also this power that whoever I lay hands on may receive the Holy Spirit."
44,8,20,"But Peter said to him, Your money perish with you because you have thought that you could buy the gift of God with money!"
44,8,21,"You have no part or lot in this matter. For your heart is not right before God."
44,8,22,"Repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that, if possible, the thought of your heart may be forgiven you."
44,8,23,"For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the fetters of unrighteousness."
44,8,24,"Simon answered, You pray for me to the Lord that nothing of what you have said may come on me."
44,8,25,"So when they had borne their testimony and had spoken the message of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, telling the good news in many villages of the Samaritans."
44,8,26,"An angel of the Lord said to Philip, Arise and go south-ward on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, the road through the desert."
44,8,27,"He arose and went. Now there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of high rank under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over her treasury. He had been to Jerusalem to worship"
44,8,28,"and was on his return, sitting in his chariot and reading the prophet Isaiah."
44,8,29,"The Spirit said to Philip, Go up and join this chariot."
44,8,30,"Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Do you understand what you are reading?"
44,8,31,"He said, How can I without some one to guide me? He begged Philip to come up and sit with him."
44,8,32,"The passage of Scripture that he was reading was, He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, so he did not open his mouth."
44,8,33,"In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who will describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth."
44,8,34,"The eunuch said to Philip, Please tell me, of whom is the prophet speaking \'97 of himself or of some one else?"
44,8,35,"Philip opened his mouth and beginning with that Scripture told him the good news about Jesus."
44,8,36,"As they were going along the road they came to water, and the eunuch said, Here is water. What is there to hinder my being baptized?"
44,8,37,""
44,8,38,"He ordered the chariot to stop and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him."
44,8,39,"When they had come up out of the water, the Spirit caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more. He went on his way rejoicing."
44,8,40,"But Philip found himself at Azotus, and passing through all the cities he told the good news until he came to Casarea."
44,9,1,"SAUL was still breathing out threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord. He went to the High Priest"
44,9,2,"and asked from him letters to the synagogues in Damascus, that if he should find any persons who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem."
44,9,3,"On his journey he was getting near to Damascus when suddenly a light from heaven flashed round him."
44,9,4,"He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him,"
44,9,5,"He asked, Who is speaking? The answer was,"
44,9,6,""
44,9,7,"The men who were on the road with him stood struck dumb, hearing the voice, but seeing no one."
44,9,8,"Saul rose from the earth and opened his eyes, but he could see nothing. Taking him by the hand they led him into Damascus,"
44,9,9,"and he was three days without seeing, and neither ate nor drank."
44,9,10,"There was in Damascus a certain disciple named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision,"
44,9,11,"The Lord said to him,"
44,9,12,""
44,9,13,"Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard about this man from many people \'97 how many wicked things he has done to thy holy ones in Jerusalem,"
44,9,14,"and here he has authority from the high priests to bind all who call upon thy name."
44,9,15,"But the Lord said to him,"
44,9,16,""
44,9,17,"Ananias went and entered the house and put his hands on Saul, and said, Brother Saul, the Lord has sent me \'97 Jesus who appeared to you on the road as you were coming \'97 that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
44,9,18,"Immediately scales seemed to fall from his eyes and he could see, and he arose and was baptized,"
44,9,19,"and after taking food he regained his strength. Saul passed some days with the disciples who were in Damascus,"
44,9,20,"and at once he began to proclaim in the synagogues that Jesus was the Son of God."
44,9,21,"All who heard him were astonished and said, Is not this the man who in Jerusalem persecuted those who call on this name, and who came here for the very purpose of binding and taking them to the high priests?"
44,9,22,"But Saul grew stronger and put to confusion the Jews who lived at Damascus, as he proved that this man was the Christ."
44,9,23,"When a number of days had passed, the Jews plotted to put him out of the way,"
44,9,24,"but this became known to Saul. They watched the gates day and night to seize him."
44,9,25,"But the disciples took him at night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket."
44,9,26,"When Saul reached Jerusalem, he tried to attach himself to the disciples, but all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple."
44,9,27,"But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road and how the Lord had spoken to him, and how courageously he had spoken in Damascus in the name of Jesus."
44,9,28,"After that Saul was with them in Jerusalem, going out and in"
44,9,29,"and speaking freely in the name of the Lord. He frequently spoke and debated with the Greek-speaking Jews. But they kept trying to put him out of the way."
44,9,30,"When the brethren learned of it, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus."
44,9,31,"So the church had peace throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and was built up, and advancing in the reverence of the Lord and by the encouragement of the Holy Spirit grew continually in numbers."
44,9,32,"It happened that Peter, while passing about among all the holy, came down also to those who were dwelling at Lydda."
44,9,33,"He found there a man named Aeneas who had been for eight years lying on a pallet, for he was a paralytic."
44,9,34,"Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ is healing you. Rise up and make your bed. Immediately he arose."
44,9,35,"All who were living in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord."
44,9,36,"In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha"
44,9,37,"It happened at that time that she fell sick and died. They bathed her and laid her out in an upper room."
44,9,38,"Since Lydda was near to Joppa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him begging him, Do not delay to come on down to us."
44,9,39,"Peter arose and went along with them. On his arrival they took him up to the room. All of the widows came around him wailing and showing the tunics and cloaks that Dorcas had made while she was with them."
44,9,40,"Peter sent them all out and kneeling down he prayed. Then turning to the body he said, Tabitha, rise. She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up."
44,9,41,"Giving her his hand he raised her to her feet. Then calling the holy and the widows he presented her to them alive."
44,9,42,"This became known through all Joppa and many believed in the Lord."
44,9,43,"Peter stayed in Joppa many days with a man named Simon, a tanner."
44,10,1,"THERE was in Caesarea a man named Cornelius, a centurion in the battalion called the Italian cohort."
44,10,2,"He was a pious man, reverencing God with all his household, doing many acts of charity to the people and praying to God constantly."
44,10,3,"About three o'clock one afternoon he saw plainly in a vision an angel come in and say to him, Cornelius."
44,10,4,"He gazed at him in alarm and asked, What is it, my Lord? The angel said to him, Your prayers and your gifts of charity have come up as an evidence before God."
44,10,5,"Now send men to Joppa and ask for a man named Simon, who is called Peter."
44,10,6,"He is the guest of a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside."
44,10,7,"When the angel who had been speaking to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a pious soldier of those who were attached to him,"
44,10,8,"and, after explaining everything to them, sent them to Joppa."
44,10,9,"On the next day, while they were on the road and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray. It was about noon."
44,10,10,"He began to feel hungry and wished to eat. While they were preparing food, he fell into a trance"
44,10,11,"and saw the heavens opened and something descending like a great sheet being let down to the ground by the four corners."
44,10,12,"In it were all kinds of fourfooted animals and reptiles and birds of the air."
44,10,13,"Then a voice came to him,"
44,10,14,"But Peter said, By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unclean or impure."
44,10,15,"A second time the voice came to him,"
44,10,16,"This happened a third time, and then immediately the sheet was taken up into the heavens."
44,10,17,"Peter was thinking this over and was at a loss what the vision meant. Just then the men who had been sent by Cornelius, after inquiring for the house of Simon, came to the door"
44,10,18,"and called to know whether Simon called Peter was a guest there."
44,10,19,"While Peter was debating with himself about the vision, the Spirit said, Here are two men looking for you."
44,10,20,"Rise and go down and go with them without misgivings, for I have sent them."
44,10,21,"Peter went down and said to the men, Here I am \'97 the man you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?"
44,10,22,"They said, Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to listen to your words."
44,10,23,"Then he invited them in and entertained them. The next day Peter arose and went away with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him."
44,10,24,"On the following day they came to Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had assembled his relatives and his close friends."
44,10,25,"As Peter was about to enter, Cornelius met him and falling at his feet did him reverence."
44,10,26,"But Peter lifted him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man."
44,10,27,"Conversing with him Peter entered the house and found many people assembled."
44,10,28,"He said to them, You understand that it is against our Law for a Jew to be closely associated with a Gentile or to visit him. But God has taught me not to call any person common or unclean."
44,10,29,"Therefore when I was sent for I came without making any objection. So now I ask, For what reason have you sent for me?"
44,10,30,"Cornelius said, Four days ago, at this hour, I was offering the three o'clock prayer in my house, when suddenly a man stood before me in shining dress"
44,10,31,"and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your gifts of charity have been remembered before God."
44,10,32,"Send to Joppa and call for Simon who is surnamed Peter. He is a guest in the house of Simon a tanner near the sea'"
44,10,33,"Immediately I sent to you and you have done well in coming. Now here we all are in God's presence to hear all that the Lord has commanded you."
44,10,34,"Peter opened his mouth and said, Truly I understand that God is not partial,"
44,10,35,"but in every nation whoever reverences him and lives righteously is acceptable to him."
44,10,36,"As to the message which he sent to the children of Israel telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ \'97 who is Lord of all \'97"
44,10,37,"you know the story that spread through all Judaea. It began in Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed."
44,10,38,"You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were harassed by the Devil, for God was with him."
44,10,39,"We are witnesses of all that he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They hung him on a cross and so killed him."
44,10,40,"But God raised him up on the third day and granted that he should become visible,"
44,10,41,"not to all the people, but to witnesses previously chosen by God, namely, to us who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead."
44,10,42,"God commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that he is the divinely appointed Judge of the living and the dead."
44,10,43,"All of the prophets testify to this, that every one who believes in him obtains forgiveness of sins through his name."
44,10,44,"While Peter was speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to his message."
44,10,45,"All the believers who were of the circumcision who had come along with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on the Gentiles,"
44,10,46,"for they heard them speaking with tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter said,"
44,10,47,"Can any one forbid water for the baptism of these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did?"
44,10,48,"And he directed that they should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain there a few days."
44,11,1,"THE apostles and the brethren throughout Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the message of God."
44,11,2,"When Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision criticized him,"
44,11,3,"saying, You went into the houses of uncircumcised men and ate with them."
44,11,4,"But Peter began and explained consecutively all that had happened. He said,"
44,11,5,"I was in the city of Joppa and was praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. Something like a great sheet was descending, lowered from heaven by the four corners, and it came to where I was."
44,11,6,"I looked at it attentively and saw the fourfooted animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the reptiles and the birds of the air."
44,11,7,"Then I heard a voice saying to me,"
44,11,8,"I said, 'By no means, Lord, for never has anything common or unclean entered my mouth.'"
44,11,9,"The voice spoke again from heaven,"
44,11,10,"This happened three times and then everything was drawn up again into heaven."
44,11,11,"Immediately three men came to the house in which we were. They had been sent from Caesarea to me."
44,11,12,"The Spirit directed me to go with them without any questioning. These six brethren also went with me, and we entered the man's house."
44,11,13,"He related to us how he had seen in his house an angel who stood and said, 'Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter."
44,11,14,"He will speak to you words by which you and your whole household will be saved.'"
44,11,15,"When I began speaking the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as on us at the beginning,"
44,11,16,"and I remembered the words of the Lord how he said,"
44,11,17,"If then God gave to them the same gift that he gave to us on believing in the Lord Jesus, who was I that I could oppose God?"
44,11,18,"On hearing this they ceased their criticism and gave glory to God, saying, Then even to the Gentiles God has granted the change of heart that leads to life."
44,11,19,"Those who were scattered abroad by the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message to none but Jews."
44,11,20,"Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, and they on reaching Antioch spoke also to the Greeks, telling them the good news of the Lord Jesus."
44,11,21,"The hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number believed and turned to the Lord."
44,11,22,"Word came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem regarding these men, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch."
44,11,23,"When he arrived and saw the grace of God he was delighted, and he encouraged all to be firmly faithful to the Lord."
44,11,24,"For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. A considerable number were added to the Lord."
44,11,25,"Barnabas went away to Tarsus to look up Saul,"
44,11,26,"and upon finding him he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a large company, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians."
44,11,27,"In those days some prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch."
44,11,28,"One of them named Agabus arose and foretold through the Holy Spirit that a great famine was going to occur over all the inhabited world."
44,11,29,"Then the disciples determined, each according to his means, to send something for the help of the brethren who were living in Judaea."
44,11,30,"This they did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul."
44,12,1,"ABOUT that time King Herod laid hands on some members of the church in order to maltreat them."
44,12,2,"He killed James the brother of John with the sword."
44,12,3,"Seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the Days of Unleavened Bread."
44,12,4,"He seized him and put him in prison, committing him to four guards of four soldiers each for safe keeping, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover."
44,12,5,"So Peter was under guard in the prison. But prayer was continually made by the church to God for him."
44,12,6,"On the very night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains, and guards before the door were watching the prison."
44,12,7,"Suddenly an angel of the Lord was there. Light shone in the cell. Striking Peter's side he woke him, saying, Rise up quickly. His chains fell off his hands."
44,12,8,"The angel said to him, Put on your belt and your sandals. Peter did so. The angel said to him, Throw your cloak around you and follow me."
44,12,9,"Peter came out and followed along, not knowing whether what the angel was doing was real. He thought he was seeing a vision."
44,12,10,"After passing the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city. This opened for them of its own accord and they went out and went along one street. Then suddenly the angel left him."
44,12,11,"When Peter came to himself, he said, Now I know truly that the Lord has sent his angel and has delivered me out of the hands of Herod, and from all the expectation of the Jewish people."
44,12,12,"So understanding the situation, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John called Mark, where a number were assembled and were praying."
44,12,13,"When Peter knocked at the door of the entry, a girl named Rhoda came to listen,"
44,12,14,"and when she recognized Peter's voice, without opening the door, she ran for joy and told them that Peter was standing at the door."
44,12,15,"They said to her, You are insane. But she was positive that it was so. They said, It is his angel."
44,12,16,"Peter continued knocking. When they opened the door and saw him they were amazed."
44,12,17,"He motioned to them with his hand to be silent, and explained to them how the Lord had delivered him out of the prison, and he said, Tell this to James and the brethren. Then he left and went to a different place."
44,12,18,"When day came there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter."
44,12,19,"Herod searched for him, but not finding him he closely questioned the guards and ordered them to be led away to execution. Then he went down from Jerusalem to Caesarea and stayed there."
44,12,20,"Herod had a bitter feud with the Tyrians and Sidonians. But they came to him with one mind, and having won over Blastus, the King's chamberlain, they begged for peace, because their country depended for its food supply on the King's country."
44,12,21,"On an appointed day Herod in his royal robes sat on a platform and made an address to them."
44,12,22,"The people shouted, It is a god's voice, not a man's."
44,12,23,"Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give the glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and expired."
44,12,24,"But God's message grew and spread."
44,12,25,"Barnabas and Saul after fulfilling their mission returned from Jerusalem, bringing along with them John, surnamed Mark."
44,13,1,"THERE were in Antioch among the members of the church several prophets and teachers \'97 Barnabas, and Symeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen"
44,13,2,"As they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
44,13,3,"Then, after fasting and praying and laying their hands upon them, they sent them off."
44,13,4,"Sent out in this way by the Holy Spirit, Barnabas and Saul went down to Seleucia and from there sailed for Cyprus."
44,13,5,"Arriving at Salamis they announced God's message in the synagogues of the Jews. They had John as their assistant."
44,13,6,"After passing through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came across a Jewish magician and false prophet, named Bar-Jesus,"
44,13,7,"who was in the company of the Proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. The Proconsul invited in Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear God's message."
44,13,8,"But Elymas the magician"
44,13,9,"But Saul"
44,13,10,"and said, You who are full of every kind of fraud, you son of the Devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you never stop perverting the straight paths of the Lord?"
44,13,11,"And now the hand of the Lord is upon you and you will be blind for a time, unable to see the sun. Immediately a dimness and darkness fell on him, and he went about seeking for people to lead him by the hand."
44,13,12,"Then the Proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord."
44,13,13,"Sailing away from Paphos, Paul and his companions came to Perga in Pamphylia. John left them there and returned to Jerusalem."
44,13,14,"But they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and sat down."
44,13,15,"After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue directors sent to them saying, Brethren, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, speak it."
44,13,16,"Paul rose and motioning with his hand said, Israelites and you who reverence God, listen."
44,13,17,"The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their sojourn in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm brought them out."
44,13,18,"For a period of about forty years he fed them in the wilderness,"
44,13,19,"and after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred and fifty years."
44,13,20,"After that he gave them judges down to the prophet Samuel."
44,13,21,"Next they asked for a king and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years."
44,13,22,"After removing him, God raised up David to be their king, to whom he bore testimony, 'I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart. He will carry out all my purposes.'"
44,13,23,"Of this man's descendants God, according to his promise, brought to Israel a savior \'97 Jesus,"
44,13,24,"before whose coming John had proclaimed to all the people of Israel baptism for a change of heart."
44,13,25,"As John was finishing his career he used to say, 'What do you think that I am? I am not he. But one is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to unfasten.'"
44,13,26,"Brethren, sons of Abraham's race and those among you who reverence God, the message of this salvation has been sent to you."
44,13,27,"For the inhabitants of Jerusalem and their rulers, neither understanding him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled those utterances by condemning him."
44,13,28,"Although they found no ground for putting him to death they begged Pilate to have him killed."
44,13,29,"When they had completely done all that had been predicted about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb."
44,13,30,"But God raised him from the dead"
44,13,31,"and he appeared for many days to those who had gone up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to all the people."
44,13,32,"We tell you the good news that the promise to our fathers has been kept;"
44,13,33,"for God has fulfilled it for our children in raising up Jesus, as it is written in the second psalm, 'Thou art my son; to-day I have become thy father.'"
44,13,34,"And as to his raising him from the dead, never to return to decay, he spoke thus; 'I will give you the holy and sure promises made to David.'"
44,13,35,"Therefore he says also in another psalm, 'Thou wilt not let thy holy one see decay.'"
44,13,36,"For David after serving the will of God in his own generation fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw decay."
44,13,37,"But he whom God raised up saw no decay."
44,13,38,"Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you."
44,13,39,"Yes, every one who believes in him is cleared from all the sins from which you could not be cleared by the Law of Moses."
44,13,40,"Take care then that what was said in the Prophets does not come on you,"
44,13,41,"'See, you disdainful ones, and wonder and perish; for I am working a work in your days \'97 a work which you will not believe even if some one fully explains it to you.' "
44,13,42,"As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people begged that these words might be spoken to them on the next Sabbath."
44,13,43,"After the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and of the pious converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked to them and endeavored to persuade them to hold fast to the grace of God."
44,13,44,"On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the message of God."
44,13,45,"But the Jews, seeing the crowds, were filled with anger and kept speaking in abusive language against what was said by Paul."
44,13,46,"Then Paul and Barnabas said with fearless plainness, The message of God had to be spoken first to you. But since you thrust it away and do not judge yourselves worthy of life eternal \'97 now, we turn to the Gentiles."
44,13,47,"For so the Lord has commanded us, 'I have set you for a light of the Gentiles, that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth.'"
44,13,48,"When the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the message of the Lord, and all who were predestined to life eternal believed."
44,13,49,"The message of the Lord was carried abroad through the whole country."
44,13,50,"But the Jews stirred up the pious women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them from their boundaries."
44,13,51,"They shook off the dust of their feet as a protest against them, and came to Iconium."
44,13,52,"The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit."
44,14,1,"IN Iconium Paul and Barnabas went in the same way into the synagogue and spoke so that a large number both of Jews and of Greeks believed."
44,14,2,"But the unbelieving Jews excited and embittered the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren."
44,14,3,"Therefore the apostles spent considerable time speaking freely and fearlessly in reliance upon the Lord, who bore witness to his gracious message by permitting signs and wonders to be done by their hands."
44,14,4,"The people of the city became divided; some were with the Jews and some with the apostles."
44,14,5,"But when there was a rush made by the Gentiles and the Jews, along with their rulers, to hustle them and stone them,"
44,14,6,"the apostles learned of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding country,"
44,14,7,"and there they went on telling the good news."
44,14,8,"In Lystra there was a man sitting who was powerless in his feet. He had been lame from his mother's womb and never had walked."
44,14,9,"He was listening to Paul as he was speaking. Paul fixed his eyes on him, and, seeing that he had faith to be healed,"
44,14,10,"said in a loud voice, Stand up straight on your feet. He sprang up and walked about."
44,14,11,"When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in Lycaonian, The gods have taken human form and come down to us."
44,14,12,"They called Barnabas Zeus and Paul Hermes, because he was the principal speaker."
44,14,13,"Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates, followed by the crowds, and intended to offer sacrifice."
44,14,14,"But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they rent their garments and sprang into the crowd, crying out,"
44,14,15,"Men, why are you doing this? We too are men with the same weaknesses that you have. We are bringing you the good news that you are to turn from these foolish things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all things that are in them."
44,14,16,"In past generations he permitted all the nations to go their own ways,"
44,14,17,"though he did not leave himself without evidence, for he did you good and gave rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness."
44,14,18,"Even by saying this they with difficulty kept the crowds from offering sacrifice to them."
44,14,19,"But Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and won over the crowds, and they stoned Paul and dragged him outside of the city, thinking that he was dead."
44,14,20,"But when the disciples gathered around him he rose up and reentered the city. On the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe."
44,14,21,"Telling the good news in that city they made a number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,"
44,14,22,"reassuring the minds of the disciples and encouraging them to be steadfast in the faith, saying, Through many trials we must enter into the kingdom of God."
44,14,23,"They appointed elders for them in every church, and after prayer and fasting committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed."
44,14,24,"They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia."
44,14,25,"After telling the message in Perga, they came down to Attalia."
44,14,26,"From there they sailed for Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had now completed."
44,14,27,"Upon their arrival they assembled the church and narrated all that God, working with them, had done, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles."
44,14,28,"There they passed no little time with the disciples."
44,15,1,"BUT certain men came down from Judaea and undertook to teach the brethren, Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."
44,15,2,"Since no little dissension and controversy arose between Paul and Barnabas and these men, it was arranged that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question."
44,15,3,"So they were sent on by the church and passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles, which caused great joy to all the brethren."
44,15,4,"On their arrival in Jerusalem they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they narrated all that God, working with them, had done."
44,15,5,"Then some of the party of the Pharisees, who had become believers, rose and said, We must circumcise them and tell them to keep the Law of Moses."
44,15,6,"The apostles and elders met to confer about this matter."
44,15,7,"After there had been much debate, Peter rose and said to them, Brethren, you know that in early days God chose among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the message of good news and should believe."
44,15,8,"And God, who knows all hearts, bore witness to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us."
44,15,9,"He made no difference between us and them in cleansing their hearts by faith."
44,15,10,"Now, therefore, why are you testing God by putting on the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?"
44,15,11,"On the contrary we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus just as they are."
44,15,12,"The whole assembly remained silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles."
44,15,13,"When they ceased speaking, James said, Brethren, listen to me."
44,15,14,"Symeon has told how first God graciously visited the Gentiles and took a people for his name."
44,15,15,"With this the words of the prophets agree, as it is written,"
44,15,16,"'After this I will return and build up again the tent of David which has fallen down; yes, I will build up its ruins and erect it again,"
44,15,17,"that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles upon whom my name has been bestowed, says the Lord"
44,15,18,"who does these things foreknown from of old.'"
44,15,19,"Therefore I judge best not to trouble those of the Gentiles who have turned to God,"
44,15,20,"but to write to them to abstain from contamination with idols, and from unchastity, and from what has been strangled, and from blood."
44,15,21,"For Moses has had for generations past in every city those who preach him, for he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath."
44,15,22,"Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to select men from themselves and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, men esteemed among the brethren."
44,15,23,"They wrote and sent by their hands the following letter: The Apostles and the Brethren who are elders, to the Brethren from the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: Greeting."
44,15,24,"Inasmuch as we have heard that certain persons from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, \'97 men whom we did not authorize, \'97"
44,15,25,"it seemed good, after unanimous agreement, to select some men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,"
44,15,26,"who have exposed their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
44,15,27,"We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who will tell you orally the same things."
44,15,28,"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no further burden than these necessary things:"
44,15,29,"to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from strangled things, and from unchastity. If you keep yourselves from these you will do well. Farewell."
44,15,30,"So they were sent away and went down to Antioch, where they called together the whole body and delivered over the letter."
44,15,31,"On reading it they rejoiced over the encouragement."
44,15,32,"Both Judas and Silas, being themselves prophets, encouraged and confirmed the brethren by long addresses."
44,15,33,"After spending some time they were sent away with a message of peace from the brethren to those who had sent them."
44,15,34,""
44,15,35,"Paul and Barnabas stayed on in Antioch teaching and telling, in association with many others, the good news of the Lord's message."
44,15,36,"After some time Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go back and visit the brethren in every city in which we made known the Lord's message, and see how they are prospering."
44,15,37,"Barnabas wished to take along John who was called Mark."
44,15,38,"But Paul did not approve of taking him along, since he had left them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them into the work."
44,15,39,"Such a difference of feeling resulted that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus."
44,15,40,"Paul selected Silas and left, after being commended to the grace of the Lord by the brethren."
44,15,41,"They went through Syria and Cilicia strengthening the churches."
44,16,1,"THEY came to Derbe and Lystra. At Lystra there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman, who was a believer, and of a Greek father."
44,16,2,"He had a good reputation among the brethren in Lystra and Iconium."
44,16,3,"Paul wished to have Timothy go with him. So he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts. For they all knew that his father was a Greek."
44,16,4,"Thus they traveled through the cities and delivered to the disciples for observance the rules that had been decided on by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem."
44,16,5,"So the churches grew firmer in faith and increased in numbers from day to day."
44,16,6,"They went through Phrygia and the Galatian country, the Holy Spirit having prevented their speaking the message in Asia."
44,16,7,"Upon reaching Mysia they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the spirit of Jesus did not allow them."
44,16,8,"Passing by Mysia they came down to Troas."
44,16,9,"There a vision appeared to Paul in the night \'97 a Macedonian man was standing and begging him saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us."
44,16,10,"After Paul had seen the vision, we at once tried to go out to Macedonia, inferring that God had called on us to tell the good news to the people there."
44,16,11,"Sailing away from Troas we made a straight run to Samothrace, and on the next day to Neapolis."
44,16,12,"From there we went to Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia and is a Roman colony. We remained in that city for a number of days."
44,16,13,"On the Sabbath day we went outside of the gate to a place on the riverside where it was customary to go for prayer, and we sat down and talked with the women who had gathered there."
44,16,14,"One woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple, from the city of Thyatira, who reverenced God, was listening. God opened her heart to receive what was said by Paul."
44,16,15,"When she had been baptized along with her household, she begged us, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay, and she insisted on our doing so."
44,16,16,"It so happened that as we were going to the place of prayer a certain slave girl who had a spirit of divination met us. She was bringing great gain to her masters by divining."
44,16,17,"She followed Paul and us and kept calling out, These men are servants of God Most High, and they are teaching you the way of salvation."
44,16,18,"This she kept doing for many days. Paul was annoyed, and turning he said to the spirit, I tell you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her, and it came out at that very moment."
44,16,19,"When her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them into the public square before the authorities."
44,16,20,"Bringing them in, they said to the magistrates, These men, who are Jews, are disturbing our city"
44,16,21,"and teaching customs which it is not proper for us, who are Romans, to receive or practice."
44,16,22,"The crowd joined in the attack upon them, and the magistrates tore off their clothes and ordered them to be beaten with rods."
44,16,23,"After laying many stripes upon them they cast them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them securely."
44,16,24,"He on receiving such an order thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet secure in the stocks."
44,16,25,"But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening."
44,16,26,"Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. Immediately all the doors were opened and every one's fetters were loosed."
44,16,27,"The jailer, waking from sleep and seeing the doors of the prison open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped."
44,16,28,"But Paul said with a loud voice, Do no harm to yourself, for we are all here."
44,16,29,"Calling for a light he sprang in and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas,"
44,16,30,"and led them out and said, Men, what must I do to be saved?"
44,16,31,"They said, Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, and your household,"
44,16,32,"and they told the message of God to him and to all who were in his house."
44,16,33,"He took them at that hour of the night and washed their stripes. Then he was baptized, he and all of his household, immediately."
44,16,34,"He brought them into his house and spread the table for them, and rejoiced with his whole family because he had believed in God."
44,16,35,"When morning came the magistrates sent their orderlies to say, Set those men at liberty."
44,16,36,"The jailer told this order to Paul, The magistrates have sent to have you set at liberty. Now go out and proceed on your journey in peace."
44,16,37,"But Paul said to them, After beating us publicly and without a trial, although we are Romans, they cast us into prison. And are they now sending us out secretly? No, let them come themselves and lead us out."
44,16,38,"The orderlies reported these words to the magistrates. When they heard that they were Romans they were alarmed,"
44,16,39,"and came and begged them, and after leading them out requested them to leave the city."
44,16,40,"They came out of the prison and went into Lydia's house, and after seeing and encouraging the brethren they departed."
44,17,1,"AFTER passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica. Here there was a synagogue of the Jews."
44,17,2,"According to Paul's custom he went in to meet with them, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,"
44,17,3,"explaining and showing that it was necessary that the Christ should suffer and rise from the dead, and saying, Jesus of whom I am telling you is the Christ."
44,17,4,"Some of them were persuaded and attached themselves to Paul and Silas \'97 a large number of the pious Greeks and not a few of the leading women."
44,17,5,"But the Jews became excited and, taking with them some of the base loafers from the market-place, they made a mob and threw the city into confusion. They attacked the house of Jason and tried to bring Paul and Silas out to the people."
44,17,6,"Not finding them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the magistrates, shouting, These men who have upset the world have now come here."
44,17,7,"Jason has received them. They all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is a different king \'97 Jesus."
44,17,8,"Both the crowd and the magistrates were disturbed on hearing this."
44,17,9,"So they took security from Jason and the rest and then dismissed them."
44,17,10,"The brethren immediately sent off Paul and Silas in the night to Beraea. They on arrival went into the synagogue of the Jews."
44,17,11,"These people were nobler than those in Thessalonica. They welcomed the message with all readiness and examined the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so."
44,17,12,"Consequently many of them believed, and also not a few Greeks; women of high standing and men."
44,17,13,"When the Jews of Thessalonica learned that God's message had been proclaimed by Paul also in Beraea, they came there agitating and disturbing the crowds."
44,17,14,"At once then the brethren sent away Paul to go down to the sea coast. Silas and Timothy remained there."
44,17,15,"Those who were conducting Paul took him as far as Athens, and, after receiving a letter to Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left."
44,17,16,"While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred within him as he looked upon the city full of idols."
44,17,17,"He often debated in the synagogue with the Jews and pious persons, and in the market-place every day with whoever happened to be there."
44,17,18,"Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him, and some said, What can this idle talker mean? Others said, He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods, because he was telling the good news of Jesus and the resurrection."
44,17,19,"They took him and led him up on to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine that you are speaking of is?"
44,17,20,"For you are bringing strange and surprising things to our ears. We wish to know what these things are."
44,17,21,"For all the Athenians and the foreigners residing there spent their time in nothing else than in telling or hearing something newer than the last."
44,17,22,"Paul took his stand in the midst of the Areopagus and said: Men of Athens, I see that you are in every way unusually reverential to the gods."
44,17,23,"For in passing about and contemplating your sacred objects I came upon an altar on which was inscribed, 'To an unknown God.' What you are worshiping in ignorance \'97 that I am making known to you."
44,17,24,"The God who made the world and all the things that are in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made by hands,"
44,17,25,"nor is he served by human hands, as if he needed anything. For he gives to all life and breath and all things."
44,17,26,"And he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having marked out the appointed times and the boundaries of their abodes,"
44,17,27,"that they might seek for God, if they could feel after him and find him, though, indeed, he is not far from each one of us."
44,17,28,"For in him we live and move and are; as some of your own poets have said, 'For we also are his offspring.'"
44,17,29,"Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that deity is like gold or silver or stone, a thing carved by man's art and thought."
44,17,30,"The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all men everywhere to change,"
44,17,31,"since he has set a day in which he will soon judge the world in justice by the man whom he has appointed, and of whom he has given evidence to all men by raising him from the dead."
44,17,32,"When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some sneered; others said, We will hear you again about this."
44,17,33,"So Paul went out from the midst of them."
44,17,34,"But certain men attached themselves to him and believed. Among them was Dionysius the Areopagite, and there was a woman named Damaris and several other persons."
44,18,1,"AFTER this Paul left Athens and came to Corinth."
44,18,2,"There he found a Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus but recently come from Italy with Priscilla his wife, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul visited these people,"
44,18,3,"and because he was of the same trade stayed with them and they worked together; for by trade they were tent-makers."
44,18,4,"But in the synagogue every Sabbath he reasoned and endeavored to persuade both Jews and Greeks."
44,18,5,"When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was absorbed by the message, bearing witness to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ."
44,18,6,"When they resisted and spoke profane words, he rent his garments and said to them, Your blood is on your own heads. I am clear, and from now on I am going to the Gentiles."
44,18,7,"So he changed over from there and came into the house of a man named Titus Justus, who reverenced God. His house was next to the synagogue."
44,18,8,"Crispus, the synagogue Director, believed in the Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard believed and were baptized."
44,18,9,"The Lord spoke in the night by a vision to Paul,"
44,18,10,""
44,18,11,"So he stayed a year and six months, teaching among them the message of God."
44,18,12,"While Gallio was Proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one mind made an attack on Paul and brought him before the court,"
44,18,13,"saying, This man is inducing men to worship God in a way contrary to law."
44,18,14,"As Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it was some crime or wicked knavery, O you Jews, I would have reasonable patience with you."
44,18,15,"But if it is a dispute about doctrine and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I will not be a judge of these things,"
44,18,16,"and he drove them from before the judge's seat."
44,18,17,"Then they laid hold of Sosthenes, the synagogue Director, and beat him right in front of the judge's seat. But Gallio cared for none of these things."
44,18,18,"Paul remained a number of days more. Then after taking leave of the brethren he sailed away to Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila went with him. He had shaved his head at Cenchreae, for he had a vow."
44,18,19,"They came to Ephesus and Paul left his companions there. He himself went into the synagogue and debated with the Jews."
44,18,20,"Although they begged him to stay longer, he did not consent,"
44,18,21,"but took his leave, saying, I will return to you again, God willing."
44,18,22,"From Ephesus he put to sea and came to Caesarea. Then he went up"
44,18,23,"After spending some time there he set out and went through the Galatian country and Phrygia, place by place, strengthening all the disciples."
44,18,24,"A certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, a learned man, had come to Ephesus."
44,18,25,"He was strong in knowledge of the Scriptures and had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and, being very earnest in spirit, was teaching accurately about Jesus, although he knew no baptism but John's."
44,18,26,"This man began to speak fearlessly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him and explained to him the way of God more accurately still."
44,18,27,"As he wished to cross over to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. So he went and greatly helped those who had believed through grace."
44,18,28,"For he powerfully and publicly refuted the Jews, showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ."
44,19,1,"WHILE Apollos was in Corinth, Paul, after passing through the upper country, came to Ephesus and found certain disciples."
44,19,2,"He said to them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? They said to him, On the contrary, we did not even hear that there was a Holy Spirit."
44,19,3,"He said, How then were you baptized? They said, With John's baptism."
44,19,4,"Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of a change of heart, telling the people to believe in one who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus."
44,19,5,"On hearing that, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,"
44,19,6,"and when Paul laid his hands on them the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied."
44,19,7,"There were about twelve of these men in all."
44,19,8,"For three months Paul went into the synagogue and spoke fearlessly, arguing persuasively regarding the kingdom of God."
44,19,9,"When some were hardened and would not believe and spoke evil of the Way before the congregation, he departed from them and took away his disciples and discussed daily in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus."
44,19,10,"This went on for two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the message of the Lord."
44,19,11,"Through the hands of Paul, God did miracles of no ordinary kind,"
44,19,12,"so that handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his body were carried to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits departed."
44,19,13,"Then some of the wandering Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke over those who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims."
44,19,14,"There were seven sons of a certain Sceva, a Jewish high priest, who did this."
44,19,15,"But the evil spirit answered them, Jesus I know and Paul I know; but who are you?"
44,19,16,"and the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on them and overpowered both of them, and so belabored them that they fled from that house naked and wounded."
44,19,17,"This became known to all who were living in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and awe fell on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus came to be held in high honor."
44,19,18,"Many of those who had become believers came confessing and telling of their practices."
44,19,19,"A number of those who had practiced magic brought their books and burned them before all. Adding up the prices of them they found the total to be fifty thousand pieces of silver."
44,19,20,"Thus vigorously the Lord's message grew and strengthened."
44,19,21,"When these things had been accomplished Paul took it in mind to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there I must see Rome also."
44,19,22,"He sent on into Macedonia two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself remained awhile in Asia."
44,19,23,"At that time there arose no small commotion about the Way."
44,19,24,"For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, a maker of silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing to the artisans no small gain."
44,19,25,"He gathered these and the workmen employed about such things and said, Men, you know that from this business we get our wealth,"
44,19,26,"and you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but also throughout almost all Asia this Paul has persuaded and drawn away a large number, saying that hand-made gods are not gods at all."
44,19,27,"Not only is this trade of ours in danger of coming into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis is in danger of being held of no account, and she whom now all Asia and the wide world worship will be deposed from her majesty."
44,19,28,"Upon hearing this, they became full of anger and shouted, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44,19,29,"The city was filled with confusion, and the people rushed with one mind into the theater, having gotten hold of Gaius and Aristarchus, fellow travelers of Paul's."
44,19,30,"When Paul wished to go in and face the people the disciples would not let him."
44,19,31,"Some of the city officials who were his friends sent to him and begged him not to expose himself in the theater."
44,19,32,"Some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and the most did not know why they had come together."
44,19,33,"Some of the crowd fixed on Alexander, since the Jews were putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand and wished to make a defense before the people."
44,19,34,"But when they recognized that he was a Jew, there arose one shout from all for about two hours, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44,19,35,"Then the City Clerk quieted the crowd and said, Men of Ephesus, who is there of all men who does not know that the city of Ephesus is the temple-keeper of the great Artemis, and of her image which fell down from Zeus?"
44,19,36,"Since these things are indisputable, you ought to be calm and do nothing rash."
44,19,37,"For you have brought here these men who are not robbers of temples nor defamers of your goddess."
44,19,38,"If Demetrius and the artisans with him have a charge against any one, there are court days and there are proconsuls; let the parties state their cases."
44,19,39,"If you are seeking anything further, it shall be settled in a lawful assembly."
44,19,40,"For we are in danger of being called in question regarding to-day's mob, and we shall not be able to give a reason for this tumult."
44,19,41,"By saying this he dissolved the gathering."
44,20,1,"WHEN the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and, after encouraging them, he bade them farewell and left to proceed to Macedonia."
44,20,2,"Passing through those parts and encouraging them by many addresses, he came into Greece."
44,20,3,"There he spent three months. When a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia."
44,20,4,"There were in company with him Sopater of Beraea, the son of Pyrrhus, and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy, and from Asia Tychicus and Trophimus."
44,20,5,"These went on and were waiting for us in Troas."
44,20,6,"After the Days of Unleavened Bread we sailed from Philippi and came to them in Troas in five days. There we spent seven days."
44,20,7,"On the first day of the week, when we all were assembled to break bread, Paul was discoursing to them, being about to leave in the morning, and he extended his address until midnight."
44,20,8,"There were many lamps in the upper room where we were assembled."
44,20,9,"A certain young man named Eutychus, sitting in a window, was overcome with deep sleep while Paul went on discoursing. At last overpowered by sleep he fell from the third story and was taken up dead."
44,20,10,"But Paul went down and threw himself on him and embraced him and said, Do not make a noisy wailing; for his life is still in him."
44,20,11,"Then he went up and broke bread and ate and talked on till daybreak and so departed."
44,20,12,"They brought the boy living, and were not a little comforted."
44,20,13,"We went in advance to the ship and sailed for Assos, intending to take on Paul there, for so he had arranged, intending to come himself by land."
44,20,14,"So when he joined us at Assos, we took him aboard and came to Mitylene."
44,20,15,"From there we sailed next day and arrived off Chios. The next day we came to Samos, and on the following day to Miletus."
44,20,16,"For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus in order not to spend time in Asia. He was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the Day of Pentecost."
44,20,17,"From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church."
44,20,18,"When they came to him, he said to them, You know how I have lived among you the whole time since the first day I set foot in Asia,"
44,20,19,"serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that befell me through the plots of the Jews \'97"
44,20,20,"how I did not shrink from telling you anything that was profitable or from teaching you publicly and from house to house,"
44,20,21,"urging upon both Jews and Greeks the need of a change of heart toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus."
44,20,22,"And now I am on my way, bound in spirit, to Jerusalem, not knowing what is to befall me there,"
44,20,23,"except that the Holy Spirit testifies from city to city that chains and trials are waiting for me."
44,20,24,"But I do not hold my life as of any account if only I may finish my race and the service which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the good news of the grace of God."
44,20,25,"And now I know that you all, among whom I have gone about heralding the kingdom, will never see my face again."
44,20,26,"Therefore I testify to you to-day that I am clear of the blood of all."
44,20,27,"For I did not shrink from telling you the whole purpose of God."
44,20,28,"Be watchful of yourselves and of all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers. Shepherd the church of God which he bought with his own blood."
44,20,29,"I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come among you, not sparing the flock."
44,20,30,"And from among yourselves men will arise speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after themselves."
44,20,31,"Therefore watch, remembering that for three years I never ceased night nor day to exhort each one of you with tears."
44,20,32,"And now I commit you to the Lord and to his gracious message, which can build you up and give you the heritage among all those who have been made holy."
44,20,33,"I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel."
44,20,34,"You yourselves know that these hands provided for my needs and the needs of my companions."
44,20,35,"In all things I showed you that so laboring we ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he said,"
44,20,36,"After saying this he kneeled with them all and prayed."
44,20,37,"All wept aloud, and falling on Paul's neck they kissed him affectionately,"
44,20,38,"grieving especially because he had said that they would never see his face again; and they escorted him to the ship."
44,21,1,"WHEN we had torn ourselves away from them and had sailed, we made a straight run to Cos, then on the next day to Rhodes and from there to Patara."
44,21,2,"There finding a ship crossing to Phoenicia we went on board and sailed."
44,21,3,"After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on the left, we sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to discharge her cargo."
44,21,4,"We looked up the disciples and stayed with them seven days. They repeatedly told Paul through the Holy Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,5,"But when we had finished the days, we left and continued our journey, and they all with their wives and children escorted us until we got outside of the city. Then, after kneeling down on the beach and praying,"
44,21,6,"we tore ourselves from one another; we went aboard the ship and they went back to their homes."
44,21,7,"We made the voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais. There we greeted the brethren and remained one day with them."
44,21,8,"On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the Seven, and we stayed with him."
44,21,9,"Philip had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy."
44,21,10,"During our stay of many days a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Jerusalem."
44,21,11,"He came to see us, and took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, 'So will the Jews in Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.' "
44,21,12,"When we heard this, both we and the residents there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,13,"Paul answered, What are you accomplishing by weeping and breaking my heart? For I hold myself ready not only to be bound, but to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,21,14,"When he would not be persuaded, we stopped talking, saying, The Lord's will be done."
44,21,15,"At the end of these days we packed up and went up to Jerusalem."
44,21,16,"Some of the disciples from Caesarea went up with us, taking along Mnason, a Cypriote, an old-time disciple, whose guests we were to be."
44,21,17,"When we reached Jerusalem, the brethren welcomed us cordially."
44,21,18,"On the next day, Paul went in with us for an interview with James, and all the elders came."
44,21,19,"After saluting them, he related in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles through his service."
44,21,20,"After hearing him, they gave glory to God and said to Paul, You see, brother, how many tens of thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and they are all zealous for the Law."
44,21,21,"These have heard reports that you are teaching all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to break away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children and not to observe the customs."
44,21,22,"What then? It will be generally heard that you have come."
44,21,23,"So do this that we tell you. There are among us four men who are under a vow."
44,21,24,"Take these men and go through purification with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that what they have heard about you amounts to nothing, but that you yourself walk in obedience to the Law."
44,21,25,"But as to the Gentiles that have believed, we have, after consideration, sent our decision that they shall guard themselves against what has been sacrificed to idols, and against blood, and against what has been strangled, and against unchastity."
44,21,26,"Then Paul on the next day took the men, and, after purifying himself, entered the Temple courts, giving notice of the completion of the days of purification \'97 the time until a sacrifice would have been offered for each one of them."
44,21,27,"But when the seven days were nearly completed, the Jews from Asia saw him in the Temple courts, and stirred up all the crowd and laid their hands on Paul,"
44,21,28,"shouting, Men of Israel, help. This is the man who teaches everybody everywhere against our people and the Law and this place, and moreover, he has brought Greeks into the Temple courts and has desecrated this holy place."
44,21,29,"For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul, and they thought that he had brought him into the Temple courts."
44,21,30,"The whole city was excited and the people rushed together. Seizing Paul, they drew him out of the Temple courts, and immediately the gates were closed."
44,21,31,"As they were trying to kill him, word went up to the Tribune of the battalion that all Jerusalem was in commotion."
44,21,32,"He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the people. They, on seeing the Tribune and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul."
44,21,33,"Then the Tribune coming up arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done."
44,21,34,"Some called out one thing and some another in the crowd. Not being able to find out anything for certain on account of the confusion, he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks."
44,21,35,"When Paul got upon the stairs, it so happened that he was being carried by the soldiers on account of the violence of the mob."
44,21,36,"For the crowd of people was following and shouting, Kill him!"
44,21,37,"As he was about to enter the barracks Paul said to the Tribune, May I say something to you? He replied, Can you speak Greek?"
44,21,38,"Are you then not the Egyptian who some time ago raised a sedition and led off four thousand assassins into the desert?"
44,21,39,"Paul said, I am a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you to let me talk to the people."
44,21,40,"He gave him leave, and Paul standing on the stairs motioned with his hand to the people. There was a great silence, and, speaking loudly in Hebrew, Paul said:"
44,22,1,"BRETHREN and Fathers, listen to the defense I now make to you."
44,22,2,"Hearing him speaking to them in the Hebrew language, they kept all the more quiet. He continued:"
44,22,3,"I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel in exact knowledge of our ancestral Law, and I was zealous for God as you all are to-day."
44,22,4,"I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women,"
44,22,5,"as the High Priest and all the eldership can testify for me. From them I received letters to the brethren and was journeying to Damascus in order to bring back in chains to Jerusalem for punishment those who had gone there."
44,22,6,"It happened that as I was journeying and nearing Damascus, about noon, suddenly a great light flashed from heaven around me."
44,22,7,"I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me,"
44,22,8,"I asked, 'Who is speaking?' He said to me,"
44,22,9,"My companions saw the light, but did not hear the voice of him who spoke to me."
44,22,10,"I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' The Lord said to me,"
44,22,11,"Since I could not see, owing to the brightness of that light, my companions led me by the hand, and so I entered Damascus."
44,22,12,"Then a man named Ananias, a strict observer of the Law and highly esteemed by all the Jews who lived there,"
44,22,13,"came to see me and stood by me and said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight,' and I, at that moment, could see him."
44,22,14,"He said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One and to hear the voice from his mouth,"
44,22,15,"for you shall be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard."
44,22,16,"And now why delay? Rise, be baptized and wash away your sins, calling upon his name.'"
44,22,17,"After I had returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the Temple courts, I fell into a trance"
44,22,18,"and saw Jesus saying to me,"
44,22,19,"But I said, 'Lord, they know that I used to imprison and beat from synagogue to synagogue those who believe in thee,"
44,22,20,"and when the blood of Stephen thy martyr was shed I myself was standing by and approving it, and taking care of the cloaks of those who were putting him to death.'"
44,22,21,"But he said to me,"
44,22,22,"They listened up to this point, but now they broke out, shouting, Away with such a fellow from the earth! He ought never to have lived!"
44,22,23,"While they were shouting and rending their garments and throwing dust into the air,"
44,22,24,"the Tribune ordered him to be led into the barracks and directed that he should be examined with the lash, so that he might know for what crime they were shouting so against him."
44,22,25,"When they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the Centurion who was standing by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and without a trial?"
44,22,26,"On hearing that, the Centurion went to the Tribune and told him, What are you going to do? For this man is a Roman."
44,22,27,"Then the Tribune came to him and said, Tell me; are you a Roman? He said, Yes."
44,22,28,"The Tribune said, I obtained this citizenship by paying a great sum of money. Paul said, But I was born to it."
44,22,29,"At once those who were about to examine him went away from him, and the Tribune was alarmed when he learned that he was a Roman, because he had chained him."
44,22,30,"On the next day, wishing to know certainly why he was accused by the Jews, the Tribune loosed Paul and ordered the high priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and stood him before them."
44,23,1,"PAUL fixed his eyes on the Council and said, Brethren, I have conducted myself with all good conscience toward God up to this day."
44,23,2,"The High Priest Ananias told those who stood near him to strike him on the mouth."
44,23,3,"Then Paul said to him, God will soon strike you, you whitewashed wall. Are you sitting to judge me by the Law and yet violating the Law by ordering me to be struck?"
44,23,4,"Those who stood by said, Are you insulting God's High Priest?"
44,23,5,"Paul said, I did not know, brethren, that he was High Priest. It is written, 'Thou shalt not speak evil of the Ruler of thy people.' "
44,23,6,"Then Paul, perceiving that one party was of Sadducees and the other of Pharisees, shouted out in the Council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am being tried for the hope of the resurrection of the dead."
44,23,7,"On his saying this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly became divided."
44,23,8,"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection nor any angel or spirit, but the Pharisees confess both."
44,23,9,"So a great uproar arose, and some of the scribes of the party of the Pharisees arose and contended, saying, We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?"
44,23,10,"When the strife was becoming violent, the Tribune, fearing that Paul might be torn to pieces by them, ordered the soldiers to go down and take him from the midst of them and bring him into the barracks."
44,23,11,"On the following night the Lord stood beside Paul and said,"
44,23,12,"When it was day, the Jews made a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul."
44,23,13,"There were more than forty who had taken this oath."
44,23,14,"They came to the high priests and elders and said, We have bound ourselves by an oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul."
44,23,15,"Now therefore you and the Council must ask the Tribune to bring him down to you, as if you were going to inquire more exactly about him, and we, before he comes near, will be ready to put him out of the way."
44,23,16,"But the son of Paul's sister heard of the ambush, and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul."
44,23,17,"Paul called to him one of the centurions and said, Take this young man to the Tribune, for he has something to tell him."
44,23,18,"He took him and led him to the Tribune and said, Paul, the prisoner, called me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you."
44,23,19,"The Tribune took him by the hand and led him aside and asked, What is it that you have to tell me?"
44,23,20,"He said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to-morrow to the Council to inquire something more exactly about him."
44,23,21,"But do not yield to them, for more than forty men of them are lying in ambush, and they have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him, and now they are ready, expecting a promise from you."
44,23,22,"The Tribune dismissed the young man after charging him; Tell no one that you have revealed this to me."
44,23,23,"Then calling to him two of the centurions he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, at nine o'clock to-night."
44,23,24,"They were to provide animals for Paul to ride and take him safely to Felix the Governor."
44,23,25,"He wrote a letter in the following form:"
44,23,26,"Claudius Lysias to his Excellency, Governor Felix: greeting."
44,23,27,"This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came up with soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman."
44,23,28,"Wishing to find what was the charge that they had against him I took him down to their Council."
44,23,29,"I found him accused regarding disputed questions of their law, but of nothing deserving of death or of bonds."
44,23,30,"Information has come to me that there will be a plot against the man, and so I am sending him at once to you, and I have commanded his accusers to state their case against him before you."
44,23,31,"So the soldiers, according to their orders, took Paul and conducted him by night to Antipatris."
44,23,32,"On the next day they let the horsemen go on with him, but they themselves returned to the barracks."
44,23,33,"The horsemen came on to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the Governor, and also placed Paul before him."
44,23,34,"He read the letter and asked of what province he was, and learned that he was from Cilicia."
44,23,35,"Then he said, I will hear what you have to say when your accusers also arrive. He gave orders that Paul should be guarded in Herod's castle."
44,24,1,"AFTER five days the High Priest Ananias came down with certain elders and an advocate named Tertullus, and they spoke against Paul to the Governor."
44,24,2,"When Paul had been called in, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Because we enjoy great peace through your administration and reforms are taking place for this nation through your prudence,"
44,24,3,"we accept it always and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all gratitude."
44,24,4,"But not to burden you further, I beg you in your fairness to hear us briefly."
44,24,5,"We have found this man a pest and an inciter of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a leader of the sect of the Nazarenes."
44,24,6,"He even tried to desecrate the Temple courts, but we overpowered him."
44,24,7,""
44,24,8,"You yourself can examine him and learn from him as to all these things of which we are accusing him."
44,24,9,"The Jews joined in the attack upon him, affirming that these things were so."
44,24,10,"Paul answered, when the Governor nodded to him to speak, Because I know that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I feel courage in defending myself."
44,24,11,"You can ascertain that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship."
44,24,12,"Neither did they find me discussing with any one in the Temple courts nor making any tumultuous gatherings in the synagogues nor anywhere in the city,"
44,24,13,"nor can they bring you proofs of their accusations against me."
44,24,14,"This I do confess to you, that in the Way which they call a heresy I worship the God of our fathers, believing all things that are according to the Law and what is written in the Prophets"
44,24,15,"and having the hope in God which they themselves also accept \'97 that there will be a resurrection both of the just and of the unjust."
44,24,16,"And in this I take pains, to have always a clear conscience toward God and toward men."
44,24,17,"After many years I came to my nation to make gifts of charity and offerings."
44,24,18,"They found me in the Temple thus occupied and purified, with no crowd or noise \'97 but there were some Jews from Asia,"
44,24,19,"who ought to have been here before you to present their accusations if they had anything against me,"
44,24,20,"or let these themselves say what wrong they found in me when I stood before the Council;"
44,24,21,"unless it was in the single assertion that I shouted as I stood among them, 'It is regarding the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial to-day before you!' "
44,24,22,"Felix adjourned the case, since he was well informed regarding the Way, saying, When Lysias the Tribune comes down, I will inquire into your matters."
44,24,23,"He gave orders to the Centurion to guard him, but to let him have indulgence, and not to hinder any of his friends from attending to his wants."
44,24,24,"After some days Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him regarding faith in Christ Jesus."
44,24,25,"While Paul was reasoning about righteousness and self-discipline and the judgment that is to come, Felix became alarmed and said, Go for the present. When I find a convenient time I will send for you."
44,24,26,"At the same time he was in hopes that money would be given him by Paul and therefore he used to send for him more frequently and converse with him."
44,24,27,"But at the end of two years Felix received Porcius Festus as a successor, and, wishing to do the Jews a favor, he left Paul in chains."
44,25,1,"FESTUS entered the province and after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea."
44,25,2,"There the high priests and the leaders of the Jews spoke to him against Paul"
44,25,3,"and begged as a favor that he would send for him to Jerusalem, intending to have an ambush and kill him on the road."
44,25,4,"But Festus answered that Paul was being kept in Caesarea and that he himself was going back very soon."
44,25,5,"Let those of you who can, he said, go down with me, and, if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring their charges against him."
44,25,6,"After spending not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea and on the next day took his seat on the judge's bench and ordered Paul to be brought in."
44,25,7,"When he had come in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him and brought many serious charges, which they were unable to prove,"
44,25,8,"while Paul claimed in his own defense, Neither against the Jewish Law nor against the Temple courts nor against Caesar, have I committed any wrong."
44,25,9,"Festus, wishing to gain favor with the Jews, asked Paul, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried for this before me?"
44,25,10,"Paul said, I am standing before Caesar's bar, where I ought to be tried. I have not harmed any Jews in anything, as you very well know."
44,25,11,"If I am in the wrong and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not ask not to die. But if there is nothing in the accusations of these men, no one has the power to give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar."
44,25,12,"Then Festus, after talking with his council, answered, You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go."
44,25,13,"When some days had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus."
44,25,14,"As they were spending a good many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the King. There is a man here, he said, who was left a prisoner by Felix,"
44,25,15,"against whom when I was in Jerusalem the high priests and the elders of the Jews had much to say, asking to have him condemned."
44,25,16,"I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any person for punishment before the accused has his accusers face to face and has opportunity for defense against the charge."
44,25,17,"So they came along down here and, without making any delay, on the very next day I took my seat on the judge's bench and ordered the man to be brought in."
44,25,18,"When his accusers arose, they brought no charge of such crimes as I was expecting,"
44,25,19,"but they had some disputes with him about their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died and whom Paul affirmed to be alive."
44,25,20,"Being at a loss about a question of this kind, I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on the charges."
44,25,21,"But when Paul appealed to be kept for the examination of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar."
44,25,22,"Agrippa said to Festus, I should like to hear the man myself. To-morrow, he replied, you shall hear him."
44,25,23,"So on the next day Agrippa came and Bernice with much display, and they entered the auditorium with the military tribunes and the principal men of the city, and at Festus' command Paul was led in."
44,25,24,"Festus said, King Agrippa and all present here with us, you see this man against whom all the multitude of the Jews pleaded with me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out that he ought not to live any longer."
44,25,25,"But I understood that he had done nothing worthy of death, and when he himself had appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him."
44,25,26,"Concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my Lord. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that after an examination I may have something to write."
44,25,27,"For it seems to me unreasonable in sending a prisoner not to specify the charges against him."
44,26,1,"AGRIPPA said to Paul, You are at liberty to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:"
44,26,2,"In regard to all of the things of which I am accused by Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that I am to make my defense to-day before you,"
44,26,3,"since you are especially expert in all Jewish customs and questions. Therefore I pray you to hear me patiently."
44,26,4,"My life from boyhood, which was from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem, all Jews know."
44,26,5,"They knew me from long ago, if they were willing to testify, and that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee."
44,26,6,"And now I stand to be tried for the hope of the promise which God made to our fathers,"
44,26,7,"to which our twelve tribes devotedly serving God night and day hope to attain. For this hope I am accused by the Jews, O King."
44,26,8,"Why do all of you consider it incredible if God raises dead men?"
44,26,9,"I thought with myself that I ought to do much against the name of Jesus the Nazarene."
44,26,10,"And I did it in Jerusalem and many holy men I shut up in prison, getting authority from the high priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them."
44,26,11,"In all the synagogues and often I punished them and compelled them to say profane words. Being excessively mad against them, I pursued them even to foreign cities."
44,26,12,"Thus engaged, as I was journeying to Damascus with authority and commission from the high priests,"
44,26,13,"about midday, on the road, I saw, O King, a light above the brightness of the sun shining from heaven around me and my companions."
44,26,14,"We all fell to the ground and I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew,"
44,26,15,"I said, 'Who is speaking?' He said,"
44,26,16,""
44,26,17,""
44,26,18,""
44,26,19,"After that, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,"
44,26,20,"but first to the people in Damascus and then to the people of Jerusalem and through all the land of Judaea and to the Gentiles, I proclaimed that they should repent and turn to God and do deeds suitable for a change of heart."
44,26,21,"For this reason Jews seized me in the Temple courts and tried to kill me."
44,26,22,"But obtaining help from God I have continued until this day witnessing to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would be,"
44,26,23,"that the Christ would suffer and that he first, by rising from the dead, would proclaim light to our people and to the Gentiles."
44,26,24,"While Paul was thus defending himself, Festus said loudly, You are raving, Paul. Much learning is driving you insane."
44,26,25,"I am not insane, he said, most noble Festus, but am uttering words of truth and soberness."
44,26,26,"The King knows about this, and to him I speak with perfect frankness, for I am persuaded that not one of these things has escaped his attention, for this has not been done in a corner."
44,26,27,"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe them."
44,26,28,"Agrippa said to Paul, With little effort you are persuading me to become a Christian."
44,26,29,"Paul said, I would to God that whether with little or with much, not only you, but all who hear me this day, would become such as I am \'97 except for these chains."
44,26,30,"Then the King rose and the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them,"
44,26,31,"and after withdrawing they said to one another, This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains."
44,26,32,"Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar."
44,27,1,"WHEN it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they committed Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of an imperial battalion."
44,27,2,"Going on board a ship of Adramyttium which was about to sail to the places along the coast of Asia we put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us."
44,27,3,"On the next day we reached Sidon, where Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to go to see his friends and enjoy their attentions."
44,27,4,"Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus because the winds were contrary."
44,27,5,"After crossing the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia."
44,27,6,"There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and put us on board of her."
44,27,7,"By slow sailing for many days we with difficulty arrived off Cnidus. Then the wind being against us, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone"
44,27,8,"and with difficulty got past it and came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea."
44,27,9,"When much time had passed and sailing was now dangerous because it was already after the Fast, Paul addressed them."
44,27,10,"Men, he said, I see that the voyage is going to be rough and with much loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives."
44,27,11,"But the Centurion listened more to the sailing master and the ship owner than to what Paul said,"
44,27,12,"and as the harbor was not convenient to winter in, the majority adopted the purpose of sailing away on the chance of being able to reach Phoenix and winter there. Phoenix is a harbor of Crete facing the southwest and the northwest."
44,27,13,"When the south wind blew softly, thinking that they had secured their purpose, they weighed anchor and coasted along Crete."
44,27,14,"But before long a hurricane, such as is called Euraquilo, swept down off the land."
44,27,15,"When the ship was caught and unable to keep her head to the wind, we gave up and let her drive before it."
44,27,16,"Running under the lee of an island called Cauda, we contrived with difficulty to secure the small boat."
44,27,17,"When we had got it in, we used ropes to undergird the ship. Fearing that we might get stranded on the Syrtis, they lowered the sail and so drifted."
44,27,18,"So violently were we battered by the storm that on the next day they lightened the ship"
44,27,19,"and on the third day with their own hands they threw over the ship's tackle."
44,27,20,"When for many days neither sun nor stars appeared and no small tempest lay on us, at last all hope of our being saved was being taken away."
44,27,21,"After they had long gone without food, Paul stood up in the midst of them and said, Men, you ought to have listened to me and not to have sailed away from Crete and met this rough experience and loss."
44,27,22,"But now I beg you to have courage, for there will be no loss of life of any of you, but only of the ship."
44,27,23,"For this night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me"
44,27,24,"and said, 'Never fear, Paul! You must stand before Caesar. And now God has granted to you all the men who are sailing with you.'"
44,27,25,"So cheer up, men. For I trust in God that it will be as it has been told me."
44,27,26,"We must, however, run on to a certain island."
44,27,27,"When the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven through the Adriatic, about midnight the sailors surmised that land was getting near."
44,27,28,"Sounding they found twenty fathoms, and after a little they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms."
44,27,29,"Then fearing that they might run into rocky places, they cast out four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come."
44,27,30,"The sailors were intent on escaping from the ship and lowered the small boat into the sea under the pretense of laying out anchors from the bow,"
44,27,31,"but Paul said to the Centurion and the soldiers, Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."
44,27,32,"Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the small boat and let her fall off."
44,27,33,"Until day began to dawn, Paul kept urging all to take food. He said, To-day is the fourteenth day that you have been on the watch fasting, not taking anything."
44,27,34,"Therefore, I beg you, take some food. For this is for your safety. Not a hair of the head of any one of you is going to perish."
44,27,35,"Saying this he took a loaf and gave thanks to God before all and broke it and began to eat."
44,27,36,"Then all cheered up and themselves took food."
44,27,37,"We in the ship were in all two hundred and seventy-six souls."
44,27,38,"After eating heartily, they lightened the ship, throwing over the wheat into the sea."
44,27,39,"When day came they did not recognize the land, but they observed a bay with a beach. Into this they planned to run the ship if they could."
44,27,40,"So abandoning the anchors they left them in the sea; at the same time loosening the bands of the steering oars and raising the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach."
44,27,41,"But falling into a place where there were cross-currents they ran the ship aground. The bow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was breaking up under the violence of the sea."
44,27,42,"The soldiers' advice was to kill the prisoners for fear that some one of them might swim out and escape."
44,27,43,"But the Centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them back from their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to shore,"
44,27,44,"and the rest to follow, some on boards and some on things from the ship. And so all got safe to land."
44,28,1,"WHEN we were safe ashore, we found that the island was called Melita."
44,28,2,"The foreign people showed us uncommon kindness. For they kindled a fire and welcomed us all because of the rain that was falling and the cold."
44,28,3,"Paul had collected a bundle of sticks and laid it on the fire, when a snake came out of the heat and fastened on his hand."
44,28,4,"When the foreigners saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, Certainly this man is a murderer, whom, although he has escaped the sea, Justice does not permit to live."
44,28,5,"He however shook off the creature into the fire and felt no harm."
44,28,6,"They kept watching to see him swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after watching a long time and seeing nothing amiss happen to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god."
44,28,7,"In the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the Governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He welcomed us and for three days hospitably entertained us."
44,28,8,"It happened that the father of Publius was lying ill with fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him."
44,28,9,"After this happened, the rest in the island who had infirmities came also and were healed."
44,28,10,"They bestowed many honors on us and when we sailed they put on board supplies for our needs."
44,28,11,"After three months we sailed in a ship that had wintered in the island. She was from Alexandria and her figure-head was the Twin Brothers."
44,28,12,"Landing at Syracuse we remained there three days."
44,28,13,"From there we came around and got to Rhegium. After one day there, a south wind sprang up and we came on the second day to Puteoli."
44,28,14,"Here we found brethren and were begged by them to stay seven days. And so we came to Rome."
44,28,15,"From there the brethren, when they got news of us, came to meet us as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns. On seeing them Paul thanked God and took courage."
44,28,16,"When we reached Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier who guarded him."
44,28,17,"After three days he invited the leading men among the Jews, and when they had assembled, he said to them, Brethren, although I had done nothing against our people or our ancestral customs, I was delivered up as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans."
44,28,18,"They, after investigating my case, wished to set me free because I had done nothing deserving of death."
44,28,19,"But when the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I have any charge to bring against my own nation."
44,28,20,"For this reason I have invited you to see me and talk with me; because it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I have this chain around me."
44,28,21,"They said to him, We on our part have received no letters about you from Judaea nor has any one of the brethren come and reported or spoken anything evil of you."
44,28,22,"We think it well to hear from you what your views are; for as to this sect we know that it is everywhere spoken against."
44,28,23,"They appointed a day for him and many came to him at his lodging. He explained to them, testifying to the kingdom of God, trying to persuade them concerning Jesus from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from early morning until evening."
44,28,24,"Some were persuaded by what he said and some did not believe."
44,28,25,"They dispersed, disagreeing with one another, after Paul had said one word, Well said the Holy Spirit through Isaiah, the prophet, to your fathers,"
44,28,26,"'Go to this people and say, You will hear plainly but you will not understand, and you will see plainly but you will not perceive."
44,28,27,"For the heart of this people has grown fat and with their ears they are hard of hearing and their eyes they have shut, so that they may never see with their eyes nor hear with their ears nor understand with their heart and repent, so that I may heal them.'"
44,28,28,"Therefore be it known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles. They will listen."
44,28,29,""
44,28,30,"Paul remained two whole years in his own rented lodging and received all who came to him,"
44,28,31,"proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all freedom of speech, unhindered."
45,1,1,"PAUL, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart to bear the good news of God,"
45,1,2,"which he foretold through his prophets in Holy Scripture,"
45,1,3,"concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord (who became one of the descendants of David according to the flesh,"
45,1,4,"and was with power proved to be the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead);"
45,1,5,"through whom we obtained grace and apostleship to promote obedience of faith for the sake of his name,"
45,1,6,"among all the Gentiles, among whom are you, called by Jesus Christ;"
45,1,7,"to all who are in Rome, beloved by God, called to be holy: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
45,1,8,"First of all I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is spoken of through all the world."
45,1,9,"For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the good news of his Son, is my witness how unceasingly I make mention of you, always in my prayers"
45,1,10,"asking if I may somehow at some time by the will of God find the way open to come to you."
45,1,11,"For I long to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual gift of grace in order that you may be strengthened,"
45,1,12,"that is, that I may be encouraged with you and by you through our mutual faith, yours and mine."
45,1,13,"I am not willing that you should be ignorant, brethren, that often I have purposed to come to you"
45,1,14,"I am a debtor to Greeks and to Barbarians, to wise men and to unthinking men;"
45,1,15,"so, for my part, I am eager to tell the good news also to you in Rome."
45,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of the good news. It is the power of God for salvation to every one who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek."
45,1,17,"For a righteousness of God is revealed in it from faith to faith, as it is written, He who is righteous by faith shall live."
45,1,18,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all impiety and wickedness of men who hold the truth but practice unrighteousness."
45,1,19,"Because what may be known of God is manifest within them, for God has manifested it to them."
45,1,20,"For God's invisible qualities \'97 his everlasting power and deity \'97 are, since the creation of the world, clearly seen, being known from what he has made. So they are without any excuse."
45,1,21,"For although they knew God they did not glorify him as God and did not give him thanks, but fell into futile speculations and their stupid hearts were darkened."
45,1,22,"Boasting of being wise, they became fools"
45,1,23,"and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into images of mortal man, and of birds and beasts and reptiles."
45,1,24,"Therefore God gave them over, in the lusts of their hearts, to uncleanness, to dishonor their bodies mutually."
45,1,25,"They changed the truth of God into a lie, and reverenced and paid worship to the creature rather than to the Creator \'97 who is blessed forever, Amen!"
45,1,26,"Therefore God gave them over to disgraceful passions. For their females changed the natural use for one contrary to nature,"
45,1,27,"and their males, leaving the natural use of the female, burned in their lust for one another, males with males practicing indecency and receiving in themselves the deserved penalty of their error."
45,1,28,"And as they did not think fit to keep God in their knowledge, God gave them over to an abandoned mind, to do the things that are shameful,"
45,1,29,"filled with all injustice, wickedness, greed, malice, full of envy, murder, strife, fraud, malignant craftiness, whisperers,"
45,1,30,"slanderers, hateful to God, insolent, arrogant, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,"
45,1,31,"without common sense, without faithfulness, without family affection, without pity."
45,1,32,"They know the just judgment of God that those who practice such things are worthy of death, yet they not only do them themselves, but are pleased with those who practice them."
45,2,1,"THEREFORE you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are, when you judge. For in judging another you condemn yourself. For you, the judge, practice the same things."
45,2,2,"But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who practice such things."
45,2,3,"Do you think, O man, you who judge those who practice such things while you do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?"
45,2,4,"Or do you despise the wealth of his kindness and forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that the kindness of God is calling you to a change of heart?"
45,2,5,"Are you with a hard and unrepentant heart treasuring for yourself wrath for the day of wrath and for the revelation of the just judgment of God?"
45,2,6,"He will give to each an award according to his works."
45,2,7,"To those who by constancy in good work seek for glory and honor and immortality he will award life eternal."
45,2,8,"But to those of a partisan spirit who do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and hot anger."
45,2,9,"Distress and crushing calamity will fall upon every human soul that works evil, upon the Jew first and also upon the Greek."
45,2,10,"But glory and honor and peace will come to every one who works good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek."
45,2,11,"For God has no partiality."
45,2,12,"As many as have sinned without a law will perish without a law, and as many as have sinned under law will be judged by law"
45,2,13,"(for it is not the hearers of law who are righteous before God, but the doers of law are pronounced righteous;"
45,2,14,"for when Gentiles who have no law do by nature what the Law enjoins, these, although they have no law, are a law to themselves;"
45,2,15,"they show the requirements of the Law written in their hearts, since their conscience corroborates it and their thoughts argue in mutual accusation or in self-defense),"
45,2,16,"on the day when God judges the secrets of men through Jesus Christ, as my good news sets forth."
45,2,17,"But if you bear the name of Jew and rely upon the Law, and make your boast in God"
45,2,18,"and know his will and are a judge of things that differ, because you have been taught out of the Law"
45,2,19,"and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of those who are in darkness,"
45,2,20,"an instructor of the unwise, a teacher of the simple, because you have the form of knowledge and of truth in the Law \'97"
45,2,21,"you who are teaching another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach not to steal, do you steal?"
45,2,22,"You who say not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?"
45,2,23,"You who boast of the Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?"
45,2,24,"For The name of God is reviled among the Gentiles because of you, as it is written."
45,2,25,"Circumcision has value if you obey the Law. But if you are a breaker of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision."
45,2,26,"If an uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, shall not his uncircumcision be credited for circumcision?"
45,2,27,"And the natural uncircumcision if it keeps the Law will judge you who with a written code and circumcision are still a law-breaker."
45,2,28,"For it is not he who is one outwardly that is a Jew, nor is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh."
45,2,29,"But he who is one secretly is a Jew, and circumcision is of the heart and in the spirit, not in the letter. His praise is not from men, but from God."
45,3,1,"WHAT then is the advantage of the Jew, or what is the benefit of circumcision?"
45,3,2,"Much in every way. First, they were intrusted with the oracles of God."
45,3,3,"For what if some were faithless, will their faithlessness prevent the faithfulness of God?"
45,3,4,"Never. Let God be true, but every man a liar, as it is written, That thou mayest be proved right in thy words and triumph when thou art judged."
45,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous when he inflicts his wrath?"
45,3,6,"Never. If so how can God judge the world?"
45,3,7,"But if the truth of God has become more abundant to his glory through my lie, why am I still condemned as a sinner?"
45,3,8,"We are not going to say, as some people slanderously affirm that we say, Let us do evil that good may come, are we? The condemnation of such people is just."
45,3,9,"What then? Have we an advantage? Not at all. We have already brought the charge against both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin,"
45,3,10,"as it is written, There is not even one righteous;"
45,3,11,"there is none that seeks God."
45,3,12,"All have turned away; together they have become worthless; there is none who does what is useful, not even one."
45,3,13,"Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they deceive; the poison of asps is under their lips."
45,3,14,"Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;"
45,3,15,"their feet are swift to shed blood;"
45,3,16,"ruin and misery are in their paths."
45,3,17,"The path of peace they do not know."
45,3,18,"There is no reverence for God before their eyes."
45,3,19,"We know that all that the Law says, it says to those who are under the Law, that every mouth may be shut and all the world may come under the condemnation of God."
45,3,20,"Therefore by works of the Law no human being will be pronounced righteous before him. For through the Law comes the knowledge of sin."
45,3,21,"But now, apart from law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, confirmed by the Law and the Prophets \'97"
45,3,22,"a righteousness from God through faith in Jesus Christ for all believers. For there is no difference."
45,3,23,"All have sinned and have come short of the glory of God."
45,3,24,"All are pronounced righteous by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,"
45,3,25,"whom God has set forth as a propitiation by his blood through faith, for the manifestation of his righteousness, because of the passing over of previous sins in the forbearance of God \'97"
45,3,26,"for a manifestation at the present time of his righteousness, that he may himself be righteous and may accept as righteous him who has faith in Jesus."
45,3,27,"Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? That of works? No, but by the law of faith."
45,3,28,"For we reason that a man is pronounced righteous by faith aside from works of law."
45,3,29,"Does God belong to the Jews only? Does he not belong also to the Gentiles? Yes, to the Gentiles,"
45,3,30,"if God is one and will pronounce the circumcision righteous by faith and the uncircumcision righteous through faith."
45,3,31,"Do we then by faith nullify the Law? Never. On the contrary we establish the Law."
45,4,1,"WHAT then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, experienced?"
45,4,2,"For if Abraham was pronounced righteous because of works, he had something to boast of. But he had nothing before God;"
45,4,3,"for what says the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness."
45,4,4,"To him who works, wages are credited not as by grace, but as due;"
45,4,5,"but to him who does not work, but believes in him who calls the unrighteous man righteous, his faith is credited for righteousness."
45,4,6,"Just so David speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works,"
45,4,7,"Blessed are they whose lawless acts have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered over."
45,4,8,"Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not charge up to him."
45,4,9,"Does this blessedness come to the circumcision, or also to the uncircumcision? For we say, Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness."
45,4,10,"How was it credited, when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision."
45,4,11,"And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of faith that he had in uncircumcision, so that he should be the father of all who believe while uncircumcised, and righteousness should be credited to them;"
45,4,12,"and the father of the circumcised, that is, of those who are not only circumcised, but who walk in the steps of the faith which our father Abraham had while uncircumcised."
45,4,13,"It was not through the Law that the promise came to Abraham or to his descendants that he should be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith."
45,4,14,"For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is emptied of value and the promise is nullified."
45,4,15,"For the Law works wrath. But where there is no law, neither is there lawbreaking."
45,4,16,"Therefore all depends on faith, that it may be of grace, and thus the promise be sure for all his descendants, not only those who are of the Law, but also those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of all of us"
45,4,17,""
45,4,18,"Abraham, when hope was past, believed in hope so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was said to him, So shall your descendants be;"
45,4,19,"and without being weakened in faith he recognized his own body as dead, when he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb."
45,4,20,"Still he did not hesitate through want of faith in the promise of God, but was strong in faith, thus giving glory to God,"
45,4,21,"and was fully confident that what God had promised he was able to perform."
45,4,22,"Therefore it was credited to him for righteousness."
45,4,23,"It was not written for his sake only, that it was credited to him,"
45,4,24,"but also for our sake, to whom it will be credited if we believe in him who raised up from the dead Jesus our Lord,"
45,4,25,"who was delivered up on account of our sins and was raised again that we might be accounted righteous."
45,5,1,"SO then, since we have been accounted righteous by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ."
45,5,2,"Through him we obtained entrance into this grace in which we stand and exult in hope of the glory of God."
45,5,3,"Not only so, but we also exult in trials, knowing that trial develops endurance,"
45,5,4,"and endurance develops a tested character, and a tested character develops hope,"
45,5,5,"and hope does not disappoint, for the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit granted to us."
45,5,6,"For while we were still without strength Christ, at the due time, died for the unrighteous."
45,5,7,"Hardly for a righteous man will any one die. For a good man some one perhaps may dare to die."
45,5,8,"But God shows his own love to us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us."
45,5,9,"Much more then, now that we have been pronounced righteous through his blood, shall we be saved from wrath by him."
45,5,10,"For if while enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life."
45,5,11,"And not only so, but we exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now obtained the reconciliation."
45,5,12,"Therefore as through one man sin entered the world, and through sin death entered, and so death spread to all men, since all sinned \'97"
45,5,13,"for down to the time of the Law sin was in the world, and yet sin is not charged where there is no law;"
45,5,14,"but death reigned from Adam to Moses even over those who had not sinned like Adam, who is the type of him who was coming."
45,5,15,"But the gracious gift is not like the fall. For if by the fall of the one the many sinned, much more did the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ abound to the many."
45,5,16,"And the free gift was not like the sentence that came through one who sinned; for the sentence came from one fall for condemnation, but the free gift was that men should be called righteous in spite of many falls."
45,5,17,"For if by the fall of one man death reigned through that one, much more those who receive the abounding grace and the free gift of righteousness will reign in life through one, that is, through Jesus Christ."
45,5,18,"As then through one fall sentence came upon all men and they were condemned; so through one righteous act the free gift came to all men so that they are pronounced righteous and live."
45,5,19,"For as by the disobedience of the one man the many were set down as sinners, so by the obedience of the one the many will be set down as righteous."
45,5,20,"But law came in alongside that the fall might be greater; but where sin became greater grace became greater still,"
45,5,21,"in order that as sin reigned in death grace might reign through righteousness and issue in life eternal through Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,6,1,"WHAT shall we say then? Shall we remain in sin so that grace may be great?"
45,6,2,"Never. How shall we who died to sin still live in it?"
45,6,3,"Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?"
45,6,4,"We were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life."
45,6,5,"For if we have grown into union with him by the likeness of his death, surely we shall be united with him by the likeness of his resurrection."
45,6,6,"For we know this, that our old-time humanity was crucified with him, in order that the sinful body might be made powerless, that we might no longer be slaves of sin."
45,6,7,"For one who has died has been pronounced righteous and free from sin."
45,6,8,"But if we died with Christ we believe that we shall live with him,"
45,6,9,"knowing that Christ, after being raised from the dead, dies no more; death no more reigns over him."
45,6,10,"For the death that he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life that he lives, he lives to God."
45,6,11,"So you must think yourselves dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus."
45,6,12,"Do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you will obey its lusts,"
45,6,13,"and do not yield your members to sin as the instruments of wickedness; but present yourselves to God as men once dead, but now living, and yield your members to God as the instruments of righteousness."
45,6,14,"For sin shall not be king over you; for you are not under law, but under grace."
45,6,15,"What then? May we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? Never."
45,6,16,"Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as servants intending obedience, you are the servants of the one you obey, whether of sin, resulting in death, or of obedience, resulting in righteousness?"
45,6,17,"Thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin you became obedient from the heart to the type of teaching in which you were instructed."
45,6,18,"You were made free from sin and made servants to righteousness."
45,6,19,"I am speaking humanly on account of the weakness of your human nature. As you did present your members as servants to impurity and to lawlessness to do lawlessness, so now you have presented your members as servants to righteousness for holy living."
45,6,20,"When you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness."
45,6,21,"What fruit did you have then? Fruit of which you are now ashamed; for the end of those things is death."
45,6,22,"But now freed from sin and having become servants of God you have your fruit in holy living and its outcome, life eternal."
45,6,23,"For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is life eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord."
45,7,1,"ARE you ignorant, brethren, for I am speaking to those who know law, that the Law rules over a person while he is living?"
45,7,2,"For a married woman is by law bound to her husband while he is living. But if the husband dies, she is freed from the law of her husband."
45,7,3,"Therefore while her husband is living she is called an adulteress if she becomes another man's. But if her husband dies she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress when she becomes another man's."
45,7,4,"So, my brethren, you were made dead to the Law through the body of Christ, that you might become wedded to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God."
45,7,5,"For when we were in the flesh the sinful passions that arise through the Law were active in our members, so that we bore fruit to death."
45,7,6,"But now the Law has been made inoperative on us, since we have died to that by which we were held, so that we serve in newness of the spirit and not in oldness of the letter."
45,7,7,"What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? Never. But I should not have come to know sin except through the Law. I should not have known lust if the Law had not said, Thou shalt not lust."
45,7,8,"Sin, taking occasion through the commandment, worked in me every lust. For apart from the Law sin is dead."
45,7,9,"I was living once, apart from law. But when the commandment came, sin began to live and I died,"
45,7,10,"and the commandment which meant life was found to mean death."
45,7,11,"For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me and by it killed me."
45,7,12,"So the Law is holy and the commandment is holy and just and good."
45,7,13,"Did then what is good become death to me? Never. But sin, that it might appear sin, worked death in me through the good, in order that it might become beyond measure sinful."
45,7,14,"For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am fleshly, sold under sin."
45,7,15,"For what I am doing I do not understand. For not what I choose is what I practice, but what I hate, this I do."
45,7,16,"But if I do what I do not choose, I agree with the law that it is right."
45,7,17,"And now it is no longer I that do it, but the Sin that dwells in me."
45,7,18,""
45,7,19,""
45,7,20,""
45,7,21,"I find then this rule, when I choose to do the right, that evil is present with me."
45,7,22,"I delight in the Law in my inner man,"
45,7,23,"but I see another law in my members, warring with the law of my mind and leading me captive under the law of sin which is in my members."
45,7,24,"Wretched man that I am! who will deliver me from this body of death?"
45,7,25,"Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then I myself with my mind serve the Law of God, but with my flesh the law of sin."
45,8,1,"THERE is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus."
45,8,2,"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed you from the Law of sin and death."
45,8,3,"For, what was impossible for the Law, because it was weak through the flesh \'97 God, sending his own Son in the form of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned the sin that is in the flesh,"
45,8,4,"so that the righteousness required by the Law might be fulfilled in us who live not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit."
45,8,5,"For those who are living according to the flesh have their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are living according to the spirit have their minds on the things of the spirit."
45,8,6,"Fleshly mindedness is death, but spiritual mindedness is life and peace."
45,8,7,"Therefore fleshly mindedness is hostile to God; for it is not subject to the Law of God, nor can it be."
45,8,8,"Those who are in the flesh cannot please God."
45,8,9,"But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God dwells in you. If any one has not the Spirit of Christ, that man is not his."
45,8,10,"If Christ is in you the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness."
45,8,11,"If the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead gives life even to your mortal bodies, through his indwelling Spirit in you."
45,8,12,"So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh;"
45,8,13,"for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live."
45,8,14,"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."
45,8,15,"For you did not receive a spirit of bondage leading again to fear, but you received a spirit of sonship, in which we cry, Abba, Father."
45,8,16,"The Spirit itself witnesses with our spirits that we are children of God."
45,8,17,"And if children, we are also heirs \'97 heirs of God, joint heirs with Christ, since we suffer with him that we may also be glorified with him."
45,8,18,"For I estimate that the sufferings of this present time amount to nothing in comparison with the glory that is to be revealed for us."
45,8,19,"For the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God."
45,8,20,"For the creation was made subject to folly not willingly, but for the sake of him who subjected it, in hope,"
45,8,21,"because the creation itself will be freed from the slavery of decay into the glorious freedom of the children of God."
45,8,22,"For we know that all the creation groans in the pangs of childbirth until now."
45,8,23,"And not the creation alone, but we ourselves also who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, groan within ourselves in expectation of the sonship, the liberation of our bodies."
45,8,24,"For we are saved by hope; but hope that is seen is not hope, for what any one sees, why does he hope for?"
45,8,25,"But if we hope for what we do not see, we patiently wait for it."
45,8,26,"Thus also the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedes for us with sighs beyond words."
45,8,27,"And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for the holy according to the will of God."
45,8,28,"We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose."
45,8,29,"For those whom he foreknew he also predetermined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren."
45,8,30,"And those whom he predetermined he also called, and those whom he called he also pronounced righteous, and those whom he pronounced righteous he also glorified."
45,8,31,"What then shall we say to this? If God is for us, who is against us?"
45,8,32,"He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how shall he not with him graciously give us all things?"
45,8,33,"Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? God pronounces them righteous."
45,8,34,"Who is there to condemn? Christ Jesus died, or rather was raised, and he is on the right hand of God interceding for us."
45,8,35,"Who shall separate us from Christ's love? Shall trial or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?"
45,8,36,""
45,8,37,"On the contrary, in all these we more than conquer through him who loved us."
45,8,38,"For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor archangels, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,"
45,8,39,"nor height nor depth nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from God's love in Christ Jesus our Lord."
45,9,1,"I AM speaking the truth in Christ; I am saying nothing false; my conscience bears witness with me in the Holy Spirit"
45,9,2,"that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart."
45,9,3,"For I could wish myself to be accursed and cast away from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh,"
45,9,4,"who are Israelites, whose is the sonship and the glory and the covenants and the reception of the law and the worship and the promises;"
45,9,5,"whose are the fathers and from whom by physical descent the Christ came. God who is over all be blessed through the ages! Amen."
45,9,6,"Not that God's word has failed. For not all who are of Israel are Israel;"
45,9,7,"nor because they are descendants of Abraham are they all children; but through Isaac shall your descendants be named."
45,9,8,"That is, not the physical descendants are children, but the children of the promise are counted for descendants."
45,9,9,"For the wording of the promise was, At this time next year I will come and Sarah shall have a son."
45,9,10,"And not only so, but when Rebecca was about to bear children to our father Isaac,"
45,9,11,"though the same man was father of both children and they were not yet born and had done nothing good or bad, in order that the purpose of God according to his choice might stand, not according to their works, but according to his call,"
45,9,12,"it was said to her, The older shall serve the younger."
45,9,13,"In the same way it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."
45,9,14,"What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness on God's part? Never."
45,9,15,"For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
45,9,16,"So then it is not a question of the man who wills or who runs, but of God who shows mercy."
45,9,17,"For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very purpose I raised you up in order to show my power upon you and to have my name proclaimed in all the earth."
45,9,18,"So then he has mercy on whom he chooses and he hardens whom he chooses."
45,9,19,"You will say to me then, Why does he still find fault? For who has opposed his will?"
45,9,20,"But who are you, O man, who are answering back to God? Does the thing that is moulded say to the moulder, Why have you made me so?"
45,9,21,"Has not the potter the right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?"
45,9,22,"What if God, choosing to exhibit his wrath and to make known what he can do, bore in long patience the vessels of wrath made for destruction,"
45,9,23,"and in order to make known the richness of his glory upon the vessels of mercy which he had prepared for glory"
45,9,24,"called us not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?"
45,9,25,"As also he says in Hosea, Those who are not my people I will call my people, and her who has not been beloved I will call beloved,"
45,9,26,"and in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they shall be called sons of the living God."
45,9,27,"Isaiah cried aloud regarding Israel, Though the number of the sons of Israel is as the sand of the sea, only a remnant will be saved."
45,9,28,"For the Lord will execute his sentence on the earth completely and speedily."
45,9,29,"Even as Isaiah predicted, Unless the Lord of armies had left us some descendants, we should have become like Sodom and should have been made to resemble Gomorrah."
45,9,30,"What shall we say then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness obtained righteousness, the righteousness of faith,"
45,9,31,"but Israel pursuing after the Law of righteousness did not attain to the Law."
45,9,32,"Why? Because they pursued it not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled over that stumbling stone,"
45,9,33,"as it is written, See, I am laying in Zion a stumbling stone, a rock to trip over, but he who has faith in him will never be put to shame."
45,10,1,"BRETHREN, the desire of my heart and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation."
45,10,2,"For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not an intelligent one."
45,10,3,"For, ignorant of God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they have not submitted to God's righteousness."
45,10,4,"For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every believer."
45,10,5,"For Moses writes that he who does the righteousness of the Law shall live by it."
45,10,6,"But the righteousness of faith says, Do not say in your heart, 'Who shall ascend into heaven?' that is, to bring Christ down \'97 "
45,10,7,"or, 'Who shall descend into the abyss?'  \'97 that is, to bring up Christ from the dead."
45,10,8,"But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart \'97 that is, the word of faith which we are proclaiming,"
45,10,9,"that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved."
45,10,10,"For with the heart a man believes and becomes righteous, and with the mouth he confesses and attains salvation."
45,10,11,"For the Scripture says, No one who believes in him will be put to shame."
45,10,12,"For there is no difference between Jew and Greek. For there is the same Lord of all, rich toward all who call upon him."
45,10,13,"For Every one who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
45,10,14,"How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? How shall they hear without some one to proclaim him?"
45,10,15,"How shall they proclaim him unless they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!"
45,10,16,"But have not all heard the good news? For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?"
45,10,17,"So then faith comes from the report and report comes through the word of Christ."
45,10,18,"But I say, it cannot be true that they have not heard, can it? On the contrary, Their sound has gone out into all the earth and their words to the ends of the world."
45,10,19,"I say, it cannot be that Israel did not know, can it? First Moses says, I will excite you to jealousy by what is not a nation and by a foolish nation I will provoke you to anger."
45,10,20,"And Isaiah makes bold to say, I was found by those who were not seeking me: I became manifest to those who were not inquiring for me."
45,10,21,"But to Israel he says, All day long I stretched forth my hands to a people who disobey and answer back."
45,11,1,"I SAY then, can it be that God has repudiated his people? Never. For I am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."
45,11,2,"God has not repudiated his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says in the story of Elijah, how he prays to God against Israel?"
45,11,3,"Lord, they have killed thy prophets: they have demolished thy altars, and I only am left and they are seeking my life."
45,11,4,"But what was the divine response? I have left to myself seven thousand men who have not knelt to Baal."
45,11,5,"So at this present time there is a remnant according to a gracious selection."
45,11,6,"But if it is by grace it is no longer because of works, for then grace would be no longer grace."
45,11,7,"What then? Israel has not found what it is seeking, but the chosen have found it. And the rest have been made dull,"
45,11,8,"as it is written, God gave them a stupid spirit, eyes not for seeing and ears not for hearing until this day."
45,11,9,"And David says, Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution."
45,11,10,"Let their eyes be darkened so as not to see, and bow down their backs always."
45,11,11,"I say, then, have they stumbled just in order that they may fall? Never. But by their fall salvation comes to the Gentiles so as to arouse the emulation of the Jews."
45,11,12,"If their fall is the riches of the world and their loss the riches of the Gentiles, how much more will their full restoration be!"
45,11,13,"But I say to you Gentiles \'97 since I am an apostle to Gentiles I glory in my office,"
45,11,14,"if in any way I may arouse to emulation my own kindred and save some of them \'97"
45,11,15,"if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their welcome back be but life from the dead?"
45,11,16,"If the first fruit was holy, so will the mass be; and if the root was holy, so will be the branches."
45,11,17,"If some of the branches were broken off and you, who are a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became a sharer in the root and rich sap of the olive,"
45,11,18,"do not exult over the branches. Even though you exult, it is not you who are supporting the root, but the root is supporting you."
45,11,19,"You will say then, Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."
45,11,20,"Certainly, for lack of faith they were broken off, and you are standing by faith. Do not be proud, but be afraid."
45,11,21,"For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you."
45,11,22,"See the kindness and the rigor of God, toward those who fell rigor, but toward you God's kindness, if you continue in his kindness, else you too will be cut off."
45,11,23,"And they if they do not continue in their unbelief will be grafted in."
45,11,24,"For God is able to graft them back. For if you were cut from your natural stock, a wild olive tree, and were grafted, contrary to nature, into a good olive tree, how much more will the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree!"
45,11,25,"I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, that you may not be self-conceited, because stupidity in a measure has come upon Israel until the full number of Gentiles comes in,"
45,11,26,"and thus all Israel will be saved, as it is written, From Zion will come the deliverer. He will remove ungodliness from Jacob."
45,11,27,"And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins."
45,11,28,"According to the good news they are enemies for your sake, but according to the promise they are beloved for their fathers' sake."
45,11,29,"God never changes his mind about his gifts and his call."
45,11,30,"For as you were once disobedient to God, but now have found mercy through their disobedience,"
45,11,31,"so they have now been disobedient in your time of mercy, that they too may now obtain mercy."
45,11,32,"For God has shut up all in unbelief in order that he may have mercy on all."
45,11,33,"O the depth of the wealth both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, how untraceable his ways!"
45,11,34,"For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who became his counsellor?"
45,11,35,"Who first gave to him so as to receive repayment?"
45,11,36,"For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory through the ages! Amen."
45,12,1,"I BEG you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, pleasing to God \'97 your rational worship."
45,12,2,"Do not follow the fashions of this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your minds so as to recognize what is the good and pleasing and perfect will of God."
45,12,3,"Through the grace given to me I say to every one among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought, but to think so as to become wise, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith."
45,12,4,"For as in one body we have many members and the members do not all have the same function,"
45,12,5,"so we who are many are one body in Christ and individually members of one another."
45,12,6,"Having gifts differing according to the grace given to us, if it is prophecy, let us use it according to the proportion of our faith;"
45,12,7,"if it is service, let us use it in service. Let the teacher use his gift in teaching."
45,12,8,"Let the exhorter use his gift in exhorting. Let him who gives do it in simplicity. Let him who manages do it earnestly. Let him who helps the needy do it cheerfully."
45,12,9,"Let your love be without pretense. Abhor what is evil; cling to the good."
45,12,10,"Have brotherly love toward one another like family affection, in honor preferring one another,"
45,12,11,"never flagging in zeal, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,"
45,12,12,"rejoicing in hope, patient in trial, constant in prayer,"
45,12,13,"contributing to the needs of the holy, devoted to hospitality."
45,12,14,"Pray for blessings on your persecutors, blessings, not curses."
45,12,15,"Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep."
45,12,16,"Be in harmony with one another. Do not be thinking of high things, but be content with humble things. Do not become conceited."
45,12,17,"Repay to no one evil for evil. Aim at what is honorable in the sight of all men."
45,12,18,"If possible, so far as depends on you, live at peace with all men."
45,12,19,"Do not revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God's wrath. For it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says the Lord."
45,12,20,"But, if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head."
45,12,21,"Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
45,13,1,"LET every person be obedient to the superior authorities. For there is no authority except from God and the actual authorities have been appointed by God."
45,13,2,"So he who resists the authority opposes the arrangement of God. Those who resist will bring on themselves condemnation."
45,13,3,"For rulers are not a terror to good deeds, but to bad. Do you wish not to fear the authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from it."
45,13,4,"For he is a servant of God to promote your good. But if you are doing evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword to no purpose. For he is God's servant to inflict his wrath on him who practices evil."
45,13,5,"Therefore we must be obedient, not only because of the punishment but as a matter of conscience."
45,13,6,"For this reason also you pay tribute. For they are God's officers attending to this very thing."
45,13,7,"Pay to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due."
45,13,8,"Owe no one anything, except to love one another. He who loves the other has fulfilled the Law."
45,13,9,"For the commandments, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not commit murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet, and any other that there may be, are summed up in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
45,13,10,"Love works no evil to a neighbor. Love therefore is full obedience to the Law."
45,13,11,"Live thus because you know this crisis, for it is already time for you to awake from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we became believers."
45,13,12,"The night is far spent, the day draws near. Let us put away the deeds of darkness, let us put on the weapons of light."
45,13,13,"Let us live becomingly as in the day, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in sensuality and licentiousness, not in quarrelling and jealousy."
45,13,14,"But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for gratifying physical passions."
45,14,1,"WELCOME him who is weak in the faith, but not in order to decide disputed questions."
45,14,2,"One man believes in eating all things. The weak man eats vegetables."
45,14,3,"The man who eats is not to despise the one who does not eat, and he who does not eat is not to judge the one who eats. For God has accepted him."
45,14,4,"Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls, and stand he will, for God is able to make him stand."
45,14,5,"One man esteems one day above another, another man esteems every day. Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind."
45,14,6,"He who regards the day regards it to the Lord and he who eats eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God. And he who does not eat abstains for the Lord and gives thanks to God."
45,14,7,"For no one of us is living for himself and no one dies for himself."
45,14,8,"If we live we live for the Lord and if we die we die for the Lord. So whether we live or die we are the Lord's."
45,14,9,"For to this end Christ died and lived again, in order that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living."
45,14,10,"But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you treat your brother with contempt? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God."
45,14,11,"For it is written, As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bend to me and every tongue shall confess to God."
45,14,12,"So then each one of us shall give account for himself to God."
45,14,13,"Therefore let us no longer judge one another, but let us rather decide not to put a stumbling block in a brother's way, or anything to trip him up."
45,14,14,"I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is defiling in itself. But to one who thinks anything to be defiling it is defiling."
45,14,15,"If because of your food your brother is grieved, you are no longer walking in love. Do not with your food destroy him for whom Christ died."
45,14,16,"Do not let what is good to you be spoken of as evil."
45,14,17,"For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."
45,14,18,"For he who thus serves Christ is pleasing to God and esteemed by men."
45,14,19,"Therefore, let us seek for what makes for peace and our mutual upbuilding."
45,14,20,"Do not for the sake of food break down the work of God. All things are pure, but anything is evil to the man who eats it with a feeling of doing wrong."
45,14,21,"It is noble not to eat meat or to drink wine or to do anything over which your brother stumbles."
45,14,22,"The faith that you have, have to yourself before God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself for what he allows himself."
45,14,23,"He who has doubts and still eats stands condemned, because he is not acting from faith. But whatever does not spring from faith is sin."
45,15,1,"WE who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves."
45,15,2,"Each of us should please his neighbor for his good so as to build him up."
45,15,3,"For Christ did not please himself, but, as it is written, The reproaches of those who were reproaching thee fell on me."
45,15,4,"All that was written of old was written for our instruction, in order that by patience and by the encouragement of the Scriptures we may have hope."
45,15,5,"May the God of patience and encouragement grant to you to have harmony with one another, in the manner of Christ Jesus,"
45,15,6,"so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
45,15,7,"Therefore, welcome one another as Christ welcomed us, to the glory of God."
45,15,8,"For I say that Christ became a servant of circumcision for the sake of God's truth, in order to confirm the promises given to the fathers"
45,15,9,"and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy, as it is written, For this will I confess thee among the Gentiles and sing to thy name."
45,15,10,"And again Scripture says, Rejoice, Gentiles, with his people."
45,15,11,"And again, Sing to the Lord, all Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise him."
45,15,12,"And again Isaiah says, There will be a root of Jesse, and one who rises to rule Gentiles: in him Gentiles will hope."
45,15,13,"May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Spirit!"
45,15,14,"I am persuaded, my brethren \'97 yes, I myself \'97 regarding you, that you are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able to instruct one another."
45,15,15,"But I have written rather boldly to you, partly to remind you, because of the grace given to me from God,"
45,15,16,"that I may be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, in priestly service of the good news of God, in order that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
45,15,17,"I do boast in Christ Jesus of my work for God."
45,15,18,"For I will not venture to speak except of what Christ has done through me to promote obedience of Gentiles, by word and deed,"
45,15,19,"through the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Holy Spirit, so that from Jerusalem around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the good news of Christ,"
45,15,20,"being ambitious to tell the good news where Christ has not been named, so that I might not build on any other man's foundation,"
45,15,21,"but as it is written, They who have had no message of him shall see and they who have not heard shall understand."
45,15,22,"This is why I have been so much hindered in coming to you."
45,15,23,"But now having no more territory in these regions and having for many years had a strong desire to come to you"
45,15,24,"while making a journey to Spain, I hope to see you as I pass through and to be furthered on my journey by you, after first partially satisfying my desire of being with you."
45,15,25,"But now I am on my way to Jerusalem to render service to the holy."
45,15,26,"For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the holy in Jerusalem."
45,15,27,"They have been pleased to do this and indeed they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared their things of the spirit, they owe them sacred service in things of the body."
45,15,28,"So after completing this and sealing to them this fruit, I shall come away and pass by you to Spain."
45,15,29,"And I know that when I come to you it will be in the fullness of the blessing of Christ."
45,15,30,"I beg you, brethren, for the sake of our Lord Jesus and the love of the Spirit to join me in wrestling in prayer to God on my behalf,"
45,15,31,"that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judaea and that my service in Jerusalem may be pleasing to the holy,"
45,15,32,"that I may come to you with joy by the will of God and be refreshed with you."
45,15,33,"The God of peace be with all of you! Amen."
45,16,1,"I COMMEND to you our sister Phoebe, a servant of the church in Cenchreae,"
45,16,2,"that you may receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of the holy, and help her in any matter in which she may need you. For she has been a provider for many, myself included."
45,16,3,"Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,"
45,16,4,"who for my life risked their own necks, to whom not I alone give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles."
45,16,5,"Give my greetings also to the church in their house. Give my greetings to Epaenetus my beloved, who is the first-fruit of Asia for Christ."
45,16,6,"Give my greetings to Mary, who has worked hard for you."
45,16,7,"Give my greetings to Andronicus and Junias, men of my race and my companions in prison, who are eminent among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me."
45,16,8,"Give my greetings to Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord."
45,16,9,"Give my greetings to Urbanus our fellow worker in Christ, and to Stachys my beloved."
45,16,10,"Give my greetings to Apelles, that tested man in Christ. Give my greetings to the household of Aristobulus."
45,16,11,"Give my greetings to Herodion, who is of my race. Give my greetings to those of the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord."
45,16,12,"Give my greetings to Tryphaena and Tryphosa, those workers in the Lord. Give my greetings to Persis the beloved, who has worked hard in the Lord."
45,16,13,"Give my greetings to Rufus the chosen in the Lord, and to his mother and mine."
45,16,14,"Give my greetings to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Petrobas, Hermas, and the brethren with them."
45,16,15,"Give my greetings to Philologus, and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the holy with them."
45,16,16,"Give my greetings to one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send their greetings to you."
45,16,17,"I beg you, brethren, to keep your eye on those who are making divisions and occasions for sin contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and to shun them."
45,16,18,"For such persons are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own stomachs, and by their smooth and pleasing talk they mislead the hearts of the innocent."
45,16,19,"For your obedience has come to the knowledge of all men. Therefore I rejoice over you, but I wish you to be wise regarding what is good, and simple in regard to what is evil."
45,16,20,"The God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you!"
45,16,21,"Timothy, my fellow worker, sends his greeting, and so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, who are of my race."
45,16,22,"I, Tertius, who penned this letter, greet you in the Lord."
45,16,23,"Gaius, my host and the host of the whole church, sends his greetings. Erastus the city treasurer sends his greetings, and so does Quartus the brother."
45,16,24,""
45,16,25,"To him who is able to make you strong according to the good news which I bear, and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, and according to the revelation of the mystery kept secret through ages,"
45,16,26,"but now made manifest through the prophetic Scriptures by the command of the eternal God, to promote obedience to the faith made known to all the Gentiles \'97"
45,16,27,"to God, the only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for the ages of the ages!"
46,1,1,"PAUL called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and Sosthenes our brother,"
46,1,2,"to the Church of God in Corinth, made holy in Christ Jesus, called to be holy, with all everywhere who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:"
46,1,3,"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ!"
46,1,4,"I am always thanking God for you because of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus,"
46,1,5,"that you are rich in him in everything, in readiness of speech and in all knowledge,"
46,1,6,"so that my testimony to Christ has been confirmed among you"
46,1,7,"and so that you are not lacking in any gift while waiting for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed."
46,1,8,"He will keep you strong to the end and free from reproach on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
46,1,9,"God is faithful, and it is by him that you have been called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord."
46,1,10,"I beg you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, all to say the same thing and not to have divisions among you, but to be united in the same mind and in the same opinion."
46,1,11,"For it has been told me regarding you, brethren, by Chloe's people, that there are dissensions among you."
46,1,12,"I mean that each of you is saying, I belong to Paul, I belong to Apollos, I belong to Cephas, or, I belong to Christ."
46,1,13,"Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?"
46,1,14,"I am thankful that I baptized no one of you except Crispus and Gaius,"
46,1,15,"so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name."
46,1,16,"I baptized also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that I do not know that I baptized any one else."
46,1,17,"For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the good news \'97 not in wisdom of words, that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of meaning."
46,1,18,"For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God."
46,1,19,"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will bring to nought the prudence of the prudent."
46,1,20,"Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?"
46,1,21,"For when in the wisdom of God the world by its wisdom did not come to know God, God was pleased to save through the foolishness of our proclamation those who believe."
46,1,22,"Jews ask for signs and Greeks seek for wisdom,"
46,1,23,"but we proclaim Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, to Gentiles folly,"
46,1,24,"but to those who are called, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God."
46,1,25,"For God's foolishness is wiser than men and God's weakness is stronger than men."
46,1,26,"Consider your own call, brethren, that not many wise, humanly speaking, not many powerful, not many high-born have been called."
46,1,27,"But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the strong,"
46,1,28,"and God has chosen the low-born things and the things of no account, the things that are not, to defeat the things that are,"
46,1,29,"that no human being may boast in God's presence."
46,1,30,"By God's act you are in Christ Jesus, who has become to us wisdom from God and righteousness and holiness and deliverance,"
46,1,31,"so that, as it is written, Let him who boasts boast in the Lord."
46,2,1,"AND I in coming to you, brethren, did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God."
46,2,2,"For I determined to know nothing among you but Jesus Christ \'97 and him crucified."
46,2,3,"And I came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,"
46,2,4,"and my speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but with spiritual and powerful proof,"
46,2,5,"that your faith might not depend on the wisdom of man but on the power of God."
46,2,6,"We do speak wisdom among the mature, but a wisdom not of this world nor of the defeated rulers of this world."
46,2,7,"But we speak a wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the world began for our glory."
46,2,8,"None of the rulers of this world knew it, for if they had known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
46,2,9,"But as it is written, What eye has not seen and what ear has not heard and what has not entered human mind, God has prepared for those who love him."
46,2,10,"To us God has revealed this by his Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God."
46,2,11,"For who of men knows what pertains to a man except the spirit of the man which is in him. Just so no one knows what pertains to God except the Spirit of God."
46,2,12,"But we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that we know the gracious gifts of God."
46,2,13,"And these we speak of, not in words taught by man's wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual things in spiritual words."
46,2,14,"But the animal man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, nor can he know them because they are spiritually understood."
46,2,15,"But the spiritual man understands all things though he himself is understood by no one."
46,2,16,"For Who has known the mind of the Lord? Who will teach him? But we have the mind of Christ."
46,3,1,"AND I myself, brethren, could not speak to you as spiritual, but as fleshly, as babes in Christ."
46,3,2,"I fed you with milk, not solid food. For you were not able to take it. Nor are you yet able, for you are still fleshly."
46,3,3,"For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and living in man's way?"
46,3,4,"For when one says, I belong to Paul, and another, I belong to Apollos, are you not men?"
46,3,5,"What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to faith, as the Lord granted to each of us."
46,3,6,"I planted, Apollos watered, but God made the seed grow."
46,3,7,"So then neither is he who planted anything nor he who watered, but God who makes the seed grow."
46,3,8,"Each will receive his own reward according to his own labor."
46,3,9,"We are God's fellow workers: you are God's farm God's building."
46,3,10,"According to the grace of God granted to me, as a wise master-builder I have laid a foundation and another is building on it. But let each be careful how he builds on it."
46,3,11,"For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ."
46,3,12,"If any one builds on this foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, straw \'97"
46,3,13,"every one's work will become manifest. For the day will show it, because it will be revealed in fire and the fire will test each one's work, of what quality it is."
46,3,14,"If the work which any one has built stands he will get a reward."
46,3,15,"If any one's work burns up he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but as through fire."
46,3,16,"Do you not know that you are God's temple and the Spirit of God dwells in you?"
46,3,17,"If any one mars the temple of God, God will mar him, for the temple of God is holy, and you are the temple."
46,3,18,"Let no one deceive himself. If any one of you thinks himself wise in this world, let him become a fool in order to become wise."
46,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. For it is written, He catches the wise in their own craftiness,"
46,3,20,"and again, The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise to be futile."
46,3,21,"Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours \'97"
46,3,22,"Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come \'97 all are yours"
46,3,23,"and you are Christ's and Christ is God's."
46,4,1,"LET a man view us as servants of Christ and stewards of God's mysteries."
46,4,2,"Moreover, in the case of stewards it is required that a man be found faithful."
46,4,3,"But it is of very slight importance to me to be judged by you or any human court. I do not even pass judgment on myself."
46,4,4,"For I am not conscious of any wrong, but I am not proved by that to be faultless. The Lord is my judge."
46,4,5,"So do not judge anything before the time, before the Lord comes. He will throw light on the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the purposes of hearts. Then each one will have his praise from God."
46,4,6,"All this, brethren, I have applied to myself and Apollos for your sake, that you may learn the maxim, Nothing beyond what is written, and may not be puffed up in partisanship for one against the other."
46,4,7,"For who gives you superiority? What have you that you did not receive? Why are you boasting as if you had not received it?"
46,4,8,"You are already fully satisfied. You have already become rich. You have become kings without us. Would that you had become kings so that we might be kings with you!"
46,4,9,"For it seems to me that God has set us apostles out last of all as men doomed to death, that we may be a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men."
46,4,10,"We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you have glory, but we are despised."
46,4,11,"Up to this present hour we are hungry and thirsty and naked and beaten. We wander about"
46,4,12,"and labor, working with our own hands. When abused we bless, when persecuted we endure it,"
46,4,13,"when slandered we entreat. We have come to be, as it were, the sweepings of the world, the riffraff of all things up to now."
46,4,14,"I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children."
46,4,15,"For if you have ten thousand teachers in Christ, still you have not many fathers. For I was your father in Christ Jesus through the good news."
46,4,16,"So I beg you to be imitators of me."
46,4,17,"For this very purpose I have sent to you Timothy, who is my loved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ \'97 how I teach everywhere in every church."
46,4,18,"Some persons have become puffed up, thinking that I am not coming to you."
46,4,19,"But I shall come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will find out, not the talk of these puffed-up ones, but their power."
46,4,20,"For the kingdom of God is not in talk, but in power."
46,4,21,"Which do you wish? Shall I come with a rod or in love and a spirit of gentleness?"
46,5,1,"IT is generally reported that there is unchastity among you, and such unchastity as is not even among the Gentiles, so that a man has his father's wife!"
46,5,2,"And you are puffed up with pride and have not rather grieved and taken steps to expel from among you the doer of this deed!"
46,5,3,"For I, absent in body, but present in spirit, have already as if I were present judged the man who has acted thus."
46,5,4,"When you assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit was also present with the power of our Lord Jesus,"
46,5,5,"I decided to deliver over such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."
46,5,6,"Your boasting is unbecoming. Do you not know that a little yeast sets the whole mass fermenting?"
46,5,7,"Cleanse out the old yeast that you may be new dough, free from yeast, as indeed you are. For Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed."
46,5,8,"So let us keep the festival, not with the old yeast nor with the yeast of evil and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
46,5,9,"I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with unchaste people,"
46,5,10,"certainly not meaning the unchaste of this world, or the covetous or extortionate or idolaters, since in that case you would have to leave the world."
46,5,11,"But now I write to you not to associate with any one who is called a brother, if he is unchaste or covetous or idolatrous or abusive or drunken or extortionate \'97 not even to eat with such a one."
46,5,12,"For what business of mine is it to judge outsiders? Is it not for you to judge those inside?"
46,5,13,"But outsiders God will judge. Expel the wicked man from among yourselves."
46,6,1,"DOES any one of you, if he has a grievance against another, dare to bring the case before the unrighteous and not before the holy?"
46,6,2,"Do you not know that the holy are going to judge the world? If the world is to be judged by you, are you unfit for the most trivial cases?"
46,6,3,"Do you not know that we are to judge angels, to say nothing of affairs of this life?"
46,6,4,"If then you have affairs of this life, do you ask men who in the view of the church count for nothing to sit as judges?"
46,6,5,"I say this to your shame. Is it true that there is among you no one wise enough to judge between a man and his brother,"
46,6,6,"but brother goes to law with brother and that before unbelievers?"
46,6,7,"Now this is an utter failure on your part that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?"
46,6,8,"But you yourselves practice wrongs and frauds \'97 and that upon your brethren."
46,6,9,"Do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit the kingdom of God? Make no mistake, neither the unchaste, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who practice unnatural vices,"
46,6,10,"nor thieves, nor the avaricious, nor drunkards, nor the abusive, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God."
46,6,11,"And such some of you were. But you have washed yourselves; but you have been made holy; but you have been pronounced righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God."
46,6,12,"All things are lawful for me, but not everything is beneficial. All things are lawful, but I will not be overpowered by anything."
46,6,13,"Food of all kinds is for the stomach and the stomach for foods. But God will end the function of one and the other. The body is not for unchastity, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body."
46,6,14,"God raised the Lord and will also raise us through his power."
46,6,15,"Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!"
46,6,16,"Do you not know that he who unites himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For God says, The two shall become one flesh."
46,6,17,"He who is united to the Lord is one spirit."
46,6,18,"Shun unchastity. Every other sin that a man does is apart from the body, but the unchaste sins against his own body."
46,6,19,"Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God, and that you are not your own?"
46,6,20,"For you were bought with a price. Glorify God then in your bodies."
46,7,1,"WITH reference to the matters you wrote of: It is an excellent thing for a man not to touch a woman."
46,7,2,"But because of the prevailing unchastity, let each man have his own wife and each woman her own husband."
46,7,3,"Let the husband pay his wife conjugal dues and the wife her husband."
46,7,4,"The wife has not power over her own body, but her husband has. In the same way the husband has not power over his own body, but his wife has."
46,7,5,"Do not deprive one another, unless by agreement for a time, that you may have freedom for prayer, and again come together. You must not let Satan tempt you through your lack of self-control."
46,7,6,"I say this by way of indulgence, not by way of command."
46,7,7,"I wish that every one were just as I am. But each has his own gift from God, one in one way and one in another."
46,7,8,"I say to the unmarried and the widows, it is excellent for them to remain as I do."
46,7,9,"But if they lack self-control, let them marry. It is better to marry than to burn."
46,7,10,"To the married I command \'97 yet not I, but the Lord \'97 that the wife is not to leave her husband"
46,7,11,""
46,7,12,"To the rest I say \'97 not the Lord: If any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she is pleased to live with him, let him not put her away."
46,7,13,"And if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he is pleased to live with her, let her not put him away."
46,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband has been made holy by the wife and the unbelieving wife has been made holy by the husband. Otherwise your children would be impure, but now they are holy."
46,7,15,"But if the unbelieving one actually leaves, let him leave. The brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases; but God has called you to peace."
46,7,16,"For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?"
46,7,17,"But, as the Lord has allotted to each, let each go on living as when God called him. So I prescribe in all the churches."
46,7,18,"Was any one already circumcised when called? Let him not efface it. Was any one called when uncircumcised? Let him not become circumcised."
46,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God is all."
46,7,20,"Let each stay in that condition in which he was called."
46,7,21,"Were you called when a slave? Let it not trouble you. On the contrary, even if you can become free, take it in preference."
46,7,22,"For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lord's freedman. Just so the free man, when called, is the slave of Christ."
46,7,23,"You were bought with a price. Do not become slaves of men."
46,7,24,"Let each one, brethren, stay in that condition in which he was called, close to God."
46,7,25,"In regard to unmarried women I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who through the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy."
46,7,26,"I think then that this is an excellent thing on account of the present distress \'97 that it is an excellent thing for a person to be unmarried."
46,7,27,"Have you been bound to a wife? Seek not release. Have you been freed from a wife? Do not seek a wife."
46,7,28,"But even if you marry, you have not sinned. Even if a maiden marries, she has not sinned. But such will have trouble in the flesh, and I would spare you."
46,7,29,"But this I say, brethren: The time is shortened. For what remains let those who have wives be as if they had none,"
46,7,30,"and those who weep as if they wept not, and those who rejoice as if they rejoiced not, and those who buy as if they possessed nothing,"
46,7,31,"and those who use the world as if not overusing it. For the present order of this world is passing away."
46,7,32,"I wish you to be free from worry. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord \'97 how be may please the Lord."
46,7,33,"The married man is anxious about the things of the world \'97 how he may please his wife,"
46,7,34,"and his interest is divided. So the unmarried woman or the maiden is anxious about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about the things of the world \'97 how she may please her husband."
46,7,35,"This I say for your benefit, not to throw a noose over you, but to promote decorum and constant devotion to the Lord without distraction."
46,7,36,"If any one thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin, if she is ripe for marriage and there is need, let him do what he will. He does not sin. Let them marry."
46,7,37,"He who stands firm in his heart, having no necessity, and has power over his own will and has decided in his heart to keep his virgin, will do well."
46,7,38,"So he who marries his virgin does well, and he who does not marry her will do better."
46,7,39,"A woman is bound as long as her husband is living. But if her husband falls asleep, she is free to marry whom she will, though only in the Lord."
46,7,40,"But in my opinion she is happier if she stays as she is. And I think that I have the Spirit of God."
46,8,1,"NOW as to things that have been sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."
46,8,2,"If any one think; that he knows anything, he does not yet know as he ought to know."
46,8,3,"If any one loves God, he is known by him."
46,8,4,"Regarding the eating of things that have been sacrificed to idols, then, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one."
46,8,5,"And though there are so-called gods in heaven and on earth, for there are gods many and lords many,"
46,8,6,"still to us there is one God the Father, of whom are all things and we for him, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and we through him."
46,8,7,"But all have not this knowledge. Some, having been accustomed to idols up to the present time, eat the food as a sacrifice to an idol, and their conscience being weak is stained."
46,8,8,"But food does not bring us near to God, for neither do we lose by not eating nor gain by eating."
46,8,9,"But be careful that this power of yours may not become a stumbling block to the weak."
46,8,10,"For if any one sees you who have knowledge reclining at table in an idol's temple, will not the conscience of that weak one be emboldened to eat things that have been sacrificed to idols?"
46,8,11,"Thus the weak man is ruined by your knowledge \'97 the brother for whom Christ died."
46,8,12,"So sinning against the brethren and wounding their weak consciences you sin against Christ."
46,8,13,"Therefore if food makes my brother stumble I will not eat meat while the world stands, for fear of making my brother stumble."
46,9,1,"AM I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?"
46,9,2,"If to others I am not an apostle, certainly I am to you. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."
46,9,3,"My defence to those who criticize me is this:"
46,9,4,"Have we not the right to eat and drink?"
46,9,5,"Have we not the right to take about with us a sister as wife, as the rest of the apostles do and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?"
46,9,6,"Or am I only, and Barnabas, without the right not to do manual labor?"
46,9,7,"Who ever serves as a soldier and supplies his own pay and rations? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it? Who keeps a flock and does not drink any of the milk of the flock?"
46,9,8,"Am I saying these things from a man's point of view or does not the Law also say them?"
46,9,9,"For in the Law of Moses it is written, You shall not muzzle an ox when he is treading out grain. Is God thinking of the oxen?"
46,9,10,"or does he say this wholly for our sakes? For our sakes; for it was written because the plowman ought to plow in hope and the thresher ought to thresh in hope of having a share."
46,9,11,"If we sowed for you things of the spirit, is it a great matter if we reap your things of the flesh?"
46,9,12,"If others share this right over you, do not we still more? But we have not used this right. No, we endure all things in order not to cause any hindrance to the good news of Christ."
46,9,13,"Do you not know that those who do the work of the Temple eat the things that come from the Temple, and those who minister at the altar share with the altar?"
46,9,14,"So the Lord has directed that those who proclaim the good news shall have their living from the good news."
46,9,15,"But I have used none of these rights and I am not writing this in order that it may be done in my case. For it would be better for me to die \'97 No one shall make my boast an empty one!"
46,9,16,"For although I tell the good news I have nothing to boast of. For a necessity is laid upon me. Alas for me if I do not tell the good news!"
46,9,17,"If I do it voluntarily I have a reward, but if reluctantly, I have been charged with a responsibility."
46,9,18,"What then is my reward? That in telling the good news I make the good news free, and do not take full advantage of my rights in the good news."
46,9,19,"For though I am free from all I have enslaved myself to all that I may gain the more."
46,9,20,"I became to the Jews a Jew, to gain the Jews; to those under law as under law, though not myself under law, to gain those who are under law."
46,9,21,"To those without law, I became as without law, though not without the law of God and under the law of Christ, to gain those who are without law."
46,9,22,"To the weak I became weak to gain the weak. To all men I became all things in order by all means to save some."
46,9,23,"I do all things for the sake of the good news that I may become a partner with it."
46,9,24,"Do you not know that those who run in a stadium all run, yet one gets the prize? Run so as to win."
46,9,25,"Every one who contends in the games practices self-restraint in all things. They do it to win a fading crown, but we for an unfading one."
46,9,26,"Thus I run with no uncertain goal: thus I strike, not as if pounding the air."
46,9,27,"On the contrary, I maul and master my body so that I may not, after preaching to others, become myself unable to stand the test."
46,10,1,"I DO not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea"
46,10,2,"and all received baptism in the cloud and in the sea,"
46,10,3,"and all ate the same spiritual food"
46,10,4,"and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ."
46,10,5,"But with the most of them God was not well pleased. For they were strewn in the desert."
46,10,6,"These things happened as warnings for us, that we may not be eager for evil things as they were eager."
46,10,7,"Be not idolaters, as some of them were, as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to dance."
46,10,8,"Nor let us be unchaste, as some of them were and twenty-three thousand fell dead in one day."
46,10,9,"Nor let us try the patience of the Lord, as some of them tried him and were destroyed by serpents."
46,10,10,"Nor murmur, as some of them murmured and perished by the destroyer."
46,10,11,"These things happened to those people as warnings and they were written for the instruction of us to whom the closing events of the ages have come."
46,10,12,"So let him who thinks that he is standing beware of falling."
46,10,13,"No trial has taken you but what belongs to human nature. God is faithful and he will not let you be tried beyond your power, but will make, with the trial, a way of escape so that you can endure it."
46,10,14,"Therefore, my beloved, shun idolatry."
46,10,15,"I speak as to thoughtful men. Judge for yourselves what I am saying."
46,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a fellowship in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a fellowship in the body of Christ?"
46,10,17,"Because there is one bread we though many are one body; for we all partake of the one bread."
46,10,18,"Look at Israel according to the flesh; are not those who eat of the sacrifice partakers of the altar?"
46,10,19,"What then am I saying? That meat sacrificed to idols is anything or that an idol is anything?"
46,10,20,"But I say that what they sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God. And I would not have you become partakers with demons."
46,10,21,"You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons."
46,10,22,"Or are we arousing the jealousy of the Lord? Are we stronger than he?"
46,10,23,"All things are lawful, but not all are beneficial. All things are lawful, but not all build up character."
46,10,24,"Let no one seek his own interest, but the interest of others."
46,10,25,"Everything that is sold in market eat, raising no questions of conscience."
46,10,26,"For the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof."
46,10,27,"If any one of the unbelievers invites you and you wish to go, eat whatever is set before you, raising no questions of conscience."
46,10,28,"But if any one says to you, This is meat that has been sacrificed, do not eat, for the sake of him who mentioned it and for conscience' sake \'97"
46,10,29,"conscience, I say, not yours, but the other man's. For why is my liberty judged by the conscience of another?"
46,10,30,"If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?"
46,10,31,"Therefore, if you eat or if you drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
46,10,32,"Cause no offense either to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God,"
46,10,33,"as I also in all things accommodate myself to all men, not seeking my own interest but that of the many, in order that they may be saved."
46,11,1,"IMITATE me as I imitate Christ."
46,11,2,"I praise you because you remember me in all things and hold firmly the traditions as I passed them on to you."
46,11,3,"I wish you to know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God."
46,11,4,"Every man praying or prophesying with his head draped dishonors his head."
46,11,5,"But every woman praying or prophesying bareheaded dishonors her head. For it is one and the same as if she had her head shaved."
46,11,6,"For if a woman is not covered, then let her cut off her hair. But if it is a shame to a woman to cut off her hair or to shave, let her veil herself."
46,11,7,"For a man has no need to cover his head since he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of man."
46,11,8,"For man was not from woman, but woman from man,"
46,11,9,"for man was not formed for woman, but woman for man."
46,11,10,"Therefore, the woman ought to have a badge of authority on her head because of the angels."
46,11,11,"Yet neither is woman without man nor man without woman in the Lord."
46,11,12,"For as woman is from man so is man through woman, but all things from God."
46,11,13,"Decide for yourselves: is it becoming for a woman to pray to God unveiled?"
46,11,14,"Does not Nature herself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,"
46,11,15,"but that if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? Because the hair is given to her for a covering."
46,11,16,"But if any one cares to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor have the churches of God."
46,11,17,"In giving the following directions I do not praise you, because you do not assemble for the better, but for the worse."
46,11,18,"For, in the first place, I hear that when you assemble as a church there are parties among you, and to some extent I believe it."
46,11,19,"For there must be parties among you in order that it may become plain who are worthy of approval."
46,11,20,"When, therefore, you assemble it is not possible to eat the Lord's supper."
46,11,21,"For in eating each one tries to get his own supper first and one is hungry and another is drunken."
46,11,22,"Have you not homes to eat and drink in? Or do you mean to show contempt for the church of God and put to shame those who have no homes? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? For this I do not praise you."
46,11,23,"For I received from the Lord that which I passed on to you that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was betrayed, took bread,"
46,11,24,"and when he had given thanks he broke it and said,"
46,11,25,"In like manner he took also the cup after supper, saying,"
46,11,26,"For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup you proclaim the Lord's death, until he comes."
46,11,27,"Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord."
46,11,28,"But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup."
46,11,29,"For he who eats and drinks eats and drinks condemnation to himself, if he does not honor the Lord's body."
46,11,30,"For this reason many are weak and sickly among you and a number are asleep."
46,11,31,"If we judged ourselves we should not be judged."
46,11,32,"But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined in order that we may not be condemned along with the world."
46,11,33,"So then, my brethren, when you assemble to eat, wait for one another."
46,11,34,"If any one is hungry, let him eat at home, that your assembling may not bring condemnation on you. The other matters I will arrange when I come."
46,12,1,"CONCERNING spiritual things, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant."
46,12,2,"For you know that when you were Gentiles you were led away after the dumb idols just as might happen."
46,12,3,"Therefore I inform you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed, and no one can say, Jesus is Lord, except in the Holy Spirit."
46,12,4,"There are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit."
46,12,5,"And there are varieties of service, but the same Lord."
46,12,6,"And there are varieties of products, but the same God who produces all things in all."
46,12,7,"To each one is given some manifestation of the Spirit for what is profitable."
46,12,8,"To one are given, through the Spirit, words of wisdom, to another words of knowledge by the same Spirit,"
46,12,9,"to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the same Spirit,"
46,12,10,"to another works of power, to another prophecy, to another the discernment of spirits, to another varieties of tongues, to another interpretation of tongues."
46,12,11,"One and the same Spirit produces all of these gifts, distributing to each one individually as he will."
46,12,12,"For as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so also is Christ."
46,12,13,"For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all made to drink of one Spirit."
46,12,14,"For the body is not one member, but many."
46,12,15,"If the foot says, Because I am not a hand I am not of the body, it is not for that reason not of the body."
46,12,16,"And if the ear says, Because I am not an eye I am not of the body, it is not for that reason not of the body."
46,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?"
46,12,18,"But now God has placed the members each one of them in the body as he pleased."
46,12,19,"If all were one member, where would be the body?"
46,12,20,"But now the members are many, but the body is one."
46,12,21,"And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you, or the head to the feet, I have no need of you."
46,12,22,"Indeed, much more those members of the body that seem to be the weaker are necessary,"
46,12,23,"and those that we deem the less honorable parts of the body we surround with greater honor and our uncomely parts have additional dignity,"
46,12,24,"while our comely parts have no need. But God has organized the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacks,"
46,12,25,"that there may be no discord in the body, but that the members may have a common concern for one another."
46,12,26,"And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if a member is honored, all the members rejoice with it."
46,12,27,"You are the body of Christ and individually members."
46,12,28,"God placed some in the church first as apostles, secondly as prophets, thirdly as teachers, then miracle-workers, then those with gifts of healing, helpers, administrators, speakers of different kinds of tongues."
46,12,29,"Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle-workers?"
46,12,30,"Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?"
46,12,31,"Seek earnestly for the greater gifts; and yet I will show you a way that surpasses all."
46,13,1,"IF I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal."
46,13,2,"And if I have the power of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing."
46,13,3,"And if I distribute all that I have to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing."
46,13,4,"Love is longsuffering, love is kind, is not jealous, love does not boast, is not conceited,"
46,13,5,"does not behave unbecomingly, does not seek her own interest, is not irritable, does not count up her wrongs,"
46,13,6,"does not rejoice in wickedness, but rejoices with the truth,"
46,13,7,"excuses all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."
46,13,8,"Love never fails; but if there are prophetic powers, they will become useless; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will become useless."
46,13,9,"For we know in part and we prophesy in part,"
46,13,10,"but when the perfect comes what is in part will become useless."
46,13,11,"When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. Since I have become a man, I have no use for childish things."
46,13,12,"For as yet we are looking at puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then face to face. As yet I know in part, but then I shall know fully, as I have been fully known."
46,13,13,"But now faith, hope, love \'97 these three \'97 endure. And the greatest of these is love."
46,14,1,"SEEK love earnestly, be eager for spiritual gifts, but most to prophesy."
46,14,2,"For he who speaks with a tongue speaks not to men, but to God. For no one understands, and he speaks mysteries in the Spirit."
46,14,3,"But he who prophesies speaks to men what will build up, encourage, and comfort."
46,14,4,"He who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but he who prophesies builds up the church."
46,14,5,"I wish you all to speak with tongues, but I wish more to have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless he interprets so that the church may receive upbuilding."
46,14,6,"Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what benefit will I be to you unless I speak to you in a revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching."
46,14,7,"Inanimate things that give a sound, such as the flute or harp, \'97 unless they give a distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is being played on flute or harp?"
46,14,8,"If the trumpet gives a dubious sound, who will prepare himself for battle?"
46,14,9,"And so you, if you do not give by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is said? For you will be talking into the air."
46,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none without meaning."
46,14,11,"If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be a barbarian to him who is speaking, and he will be a barbarian to me."
46,14,12,"And so you, since you are eager for spiritual gifts, seek to abound in what will build up the church."
46,14,13,"Therefore let him who speaks with a tongue pray to interpret."
46,14,14,"For if I pray in a tongue my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful."
46,14,15,"What then? I will pray with the spirit and with the understanding. I will sing with the spirit and with the understanding."
46,14,16,"If you thank God with the spirit, how shall he who fills the place of the ordinary man say Amen to your thanksgiving? For he does not know what you are saying."
46,14,17,"You give thanks excellently, but the other is not helped by it."
46,14,18,"I thank God that I speak with tongues more than any of you."
46,14,19,"But in church I would rather speak five words with my understanding so as to instruct others, than to speak ten thousand words in a tongue."
46,14,20,"Brethren, be not children in intelligence, but be babes in wickedness. In intelligence be adults."
46,14,21,"In the Law it is written, By men of strange speech and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people, and not even thus will they listen to me, says the Lord."
46,14,22,"So then tongues are for a sign not to believers, but to unbelievers, and prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for believers."
46,14,23,"If therefore the whole church assembles and all speak with tongues and ordinary men or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are insane?"
46,14,24,"But if all prophesy and any unbeliever or ordinary man comes in, he is convinced by all, he is judged by all,"
46,14,25,"the secrets of his heart become manifest, and so falling on his face he worships God, declaring that God is really among you."
46,14,26,"What then, brethren? When you assemble each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for the upbuilding of character."
46,14,27,"If any one speaks with a tongue, let it be two, or at the most three, at a time and in turn and let one interpret."
46,14,28,"If there is no interpreter, let the man keep silent in church and let him speak to himself and to God."
46,14,29,"Of the prophets let two or three speak and let the others reflect."
46,14,30,"If a revelation comes to another who is sitting by, let the first become silent."
46,14,31,"For you can all prophesy one by one so that all may learn and all be encouraged."
46,14,32,"The spirits of the prophets are under the control of the prophets."
46,14,33,"For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the holy,"
46,14,34,"let the women be silent in your assemblies. For it is not allowed to them to speak; but let them be in subjection as also the Law says."
46,14,35,"If they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home. For it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church."
46,14,36,"Did the message of God come out from you or did it come to you alone?"
46,14,37,"If any one thinks himself a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that what I am writing to you is the command of the Lord."
46,14,38,"But if any one does not know, he is himself unknown."
46,14,39,"So then, my brethren, seek earnestly to prophesy and do not hinder speaking with tongues."
46,14,40,"Let all things be done becomingly and in order."
46,15,1,"LET me recall to your minds, brethren, the good news which I announced to you and which you accepted, in which also you stand,"
46,15,2,"through which also you are being saved, if you hold fast the message that I announced to you, unless your faith was thoughtless."
46,15,3,"For among the first things I passed on to you what I had received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,"
46,15,4,"and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures,"
46,15,5,"and that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve,"
46,15,6,"then he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once, of whom the most are still living, but some have fallen asleep,"
46,15,7,"then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles."
46,15,8,"Last of all, as if to one untimely born, he appeared also to me."
46,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles and am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
46,15,10,"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not without result, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me."
46,15,11,"Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you believed."
46,15,12,"But if Christ is proclaimed \'97 that he has been raised from the dead \'97 how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
46,15,13,"If there is no resurrection of the dead, then neither has Christ been raised."
46,15,14,"If Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is an empty thing and your faith is an empty thing."
46,15,15,"And we are found false witnesses of God because we testified regarding God that he raised up Christ, whom he did not raise if the dead are not raised."
46,15,16,"For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised."
46,15,17,"And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile, you are still in your sins."
46,15,18,"Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished."
46,15,19,"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most pitiable."
46,15,20,"But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruit of those who have fallen asleep."
46,15,21,"For since by a man came death, by a man also came resurrection of the dead."
46,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive."
46,15,23,"But each in his own order. The first-fruit is Christ, then those who are Christ's, at his coming."
46,15,24,"Then will be the end when he delivers up the kingship to God his Father, when he has defeated every archangel and authority and power."
46,15,25,"For he must be king until he puts all his enemies under his feet."
46,15,26,"The last enemy to be defeated will be death."
46,15,27,"For he subjected all things under his feet. But when it says, all things have been subjected, it is plain that it means all things except God who subjected all things to him."
46,15,28,"But when all things have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all."
46,15,29,"Then what shall they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why are they then baptized for them?"
46,15,30,"And why do we run risks every hour?"
46,15,31,"I die every day, I swear it by the boast I make of you and which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord."
46,15,32,"If, humanly speaking, I fought wild beasts at Ephesus, what is my gain? If the dead do not rise, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die."
46,15,33,"Do not be led astray; bad associations corrupt good morals."
46,15,34,"Return to soberness and cease to sin, for some are ignorant of God. I say it to your shame."
46,15,35,"But some one will say, How are the dead raised, and with what sort of bodies do they come?"
46,15,36,"Thoughtless man! What you yourself sow does not come to life unless it dies."
46,15,37,"And what you sow is not the body that will come, but a mere grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else."
46,15,38,"But God gives it a body as he has pleased, and to each kind of seed a body of its own."
46,15,39,"All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another flesh of birds, and another flesh of fishes."
46,15,40,"There are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial. But the glory of the celestial is of one kind and the glory of the terrestrial is of another."
46,15,41,"There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars. For star differs from star in glory."
46,15,42,"So also will be the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in decay; it is raised imperishable."
46,15,43,"It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power."
46,15,44,"It is sown an animal body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is an animal body there is also a spiritual body."
46,15,45,"Just as it is written, The first man Adam became a living animal, the last Adam became a lifegiving spirit."
46,15,46,"But the spiritual is not first, but the animal, then the spiritual."
46,15,47,"The first man was from the earth, earthly; the second man is the Lord from heaven."
46,15,48,"As is the earthly man such are also those who are earthly, and as is the heavenly man such are also those who are heavenly."
46,15,49,"And as we have borne the image of the earthly man, we shall bear the image of the heavenly man."
46,15,50,"But I say this, brethren, flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor will decay inherit imperishability."
46,15,51,"I am telling you a mystery. We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be transformed,"
46,15,52,"in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet-call. For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be transformed."
46,15,53,"For this perishable must clothe itself with imperishability, and this mortal must clothe itself with immortality."
46,15,54,"When this perishable has clothed itself with imperishability and this mortal has clothed itself with immortality, then will come to pass the word that is written, Death has been swallowed up in victory."
46,15,55,"O Death, where is thy victory? O Death, where is thy sting?"
46,15,56,"The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law."
46,15,57,"But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!"
46,15,58,"So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; since you know that your labor is not fruitless in the Lord."
46,16,1,"REGARDING the collection for the holy, as I arranged for the churches of Galatia, you must do the same."
46,16,2,"On the first day of the week let each of you lay up at home something according as he may be prospering, in order that no collections may be going on when I come."
46,16,3,"When I come, whatever persons you may approve, I will send with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem."
46,16,4,"And if it seems best for me to go, they shall go with me."
46,16,5,"I shall come to you alter I pass through Macedonia. For I shall pass through Macedonia"
46,16,6,"and perhaps I shall make some stay with you or pass the winter with you, so that you may send me forward wherever I may be going."
46,16,7,"I do not wish to see you now merely in passing, for I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits."
46,16,8,"I shall remain in Ephesus until Pentecost,"
46,16,9,"for a great and effective door has been opened to me, and there are many opponents."
46,16,10,"If Timothy comes, see to it that he becomes free from fear in his relations to you. For he is doing the Lord's work, just as I am."
46,16,11,"So let no one think him of no account. Send him forward in peace on his journey to me, for I am expecting him with the brethren."
46,16,12,"As to Apollos our brother, I urged him strongly to go to you with the brethren. But it was not at all his will to go now, but he will come when it is convenient."
46,16,13,"Watch, stand firmly in the faith, be manly, be strong,"
46,16,14,"let all that you do be done in love."
46,16,15,"I beg you, brethren \'97 you know the household of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruit of Achaia and they have devoted themselves to serving the holy \'97"
46,16,16,"I beg you to show deference to such and to every fellow worker and laborer."
46,16,17,"I rejoice in the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they made up for my lack of you."
46,16,18,"For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Appreciate such men."
46,16,19,"The churches of Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Prisca with the church in their house greet you heartily in the Lord."
46,16,20,"All the brethren send greetings to you. Greet one another with a holy kiss."
46,16,21,"Here is the greeting of me, Paul, by my own hand."
46,16,22,"If any one does not love the Lord, let him be accursed! Maran atha!"
46,16,23,"The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you."
46,16,24,"My love to all of you in Christ Jesus."
47,1,1,"PAUL, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth with all the holy that are in all Achaia:"
47,1,2,"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
47,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of loving kindness and the God of all encouragement,"
47,1,4,"who encourages us in every distress so that we may be able to encourage those who are in every distress by the encouragement by which we ourselves have been encouraged by God."
47,1,5,"Because as the sufferings of Christ are abundant in our case, so through Christ our encouragement is abundant."
47,1,6,"But if we are in distress, it is for your encouragement and salvation. If we are encouraged, it is for your encouragement which is effective in the endurance of the same sufferings that we suffer."
47,1,7,"Our hope is strong regarding you, since we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings so you are of the encouragement."
47,1,8,"For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, regarding the distress that came on us in Asia \'97 that we were exceedingly weighed down, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life."
47,1,9,"Indeed we have the sentence of death within ourselves, that our trust may not rest on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead."
47,1,10,"He delivered us from such a death and will deliver, and we have hope in him that he will go on delivering,"
47,1,11,"while you help by your prayers for us, so that from many persons thanksgiving may arise for the gift granted to us through the prayers of many for us."
47,1,12,"For this is what we boast of, the witness of our conscience that in holiness, and sincerity before God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have lived in the world and especially toward you."
47,1,13,"For we are not writing to you anything but what you read and acknowledge and I hope you will acknowledge to the end,"
47,1,14,"as you have partly acknowledged it about us, that we are your ground of boasting and you are ours on the day of our Lord Jesus."
47,1,15,"With this confidence I intended to come to you first, so that you might have a second favor,"
47,1,16,"by my visiting you on the way to Macedonia and again coming back from Macedonia to you and being sped by you on my way toward Juda."
47,1,17,"When I was intending this, did I show fickleness? Or do I plan what I plan according to the flesh, so that I may say yes, yes, and no, no?"
47,1,18,"As God is faithful, my word to you is not yes and no."
47,1,19,"For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was proclaimed among you by us \'97 myself and Silvanus and Timothy \'97 was not yes and no, but in him was yes."
47,1,20,"For all the promises of God, however many, have their yes in him. Therefore also through him is the Amen to the glory of God through us."
47,1,21,"It is God who makes us and you steadfast to Christ, and has anointed us"
47,1,22,"and sealed us and has given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts."
47,1,23,"I call God as a witness against my soul that in order to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth."
47,1,24,"Not that we are lords over your faith, but fellow workers sharing your joy, for you are standing firm in the faith."
47,2,1,"BUT I decided this in my own mind, not to come again to you in sorrow."
47,2,2,"For if I grieve you, who is there to cheer me except those who are grieved by me?"
47,2,3,"I am writing this very thing so that I may not come and have grief from those who ought to make me glad, for I am confident in regard to all of you that my joy is yours."
47,2,4,"For out of great distress and pain of heart I am writing with many tears, not that you may be grieved, but that you may know the love that I have beyond measure for you."
47,2,5,"But if any one has caused grief, he has grieved not me, but to some extent \'97 not to be too severe \'97 all of you."
47,2,6,"Sufficient for such a one is this punishment by the majority,"
47,2,7,"so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and encourage him, that such a one may not be swallowed up in excessive grief."
47,2,8,"Therefore I beg you to assure him of your love."
47,2,9,"Because for this purpose I am writing, that I may know your tested character, whether you are obedient in everything."
47,2,10,"To whomever you forgive anything I also forgive it, and what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it was for your sake in the sight of Christ,"
47,2,11,"that Satan may not take advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his purposes."
47,2,12,"When I came to Troas for the good news of Christ and a door had been opened for me in the Lord,"
47,2,13,"I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find Titus my brother, but bidding them farewell I came away to Macedonia."
47,2,14,"Thanks be to God who always leads us in his triumph in Christ and spreads through us the sweet odor of the knowledge of him in every place."
47,2,15,"For we are for God a sweet odor of Christ \'97 in the saved and in the perishing."
47,2,16,"To the latter an odor from death to death, to the former an odor from life to life. And who is competent for this?"
47,2,17,"For we are not, like the most, adulterating the message of God for gain, but in sincerity, as from God, in the presence of God, we speak in Christ."
47,3,1,"ARE we beginning again to recommend ourselves? Do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you or from you?"
47,3,2,"You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men,"
47,3,3,"evidently a letter of Christ delivered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets, but on tablets that are hearts of flesh."
47,3,4,"We have such confidence through Christ toward God."
47,3,5,"Not that of ourselves we are fit to reason out anything as from ourselves, but our fitness is from God,"
47,3,6,"who has fitted us to be servants of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the spirit. For the letter kills, but the spirit gives life."
47,3,7,"If the service that brought death, engraved in letters on stones, came in glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face \'97 that fading glory \'97"
47,3,8,"how much more glorious will not the service of the Spirit be?"
47,3,9,"For if the service that brought condemnation was glory, much more will the service that brings righteousness surpass in glory."
47,3,10,"For what was made so glorious is in a way no longer glorious compared with the glory that surpasses it."
47,3,11,"For if what was to be ended came in glory, much more glorious must be that which is enduring."
47,3,12,"With such a hope then we speak with great frankness,"
47,3,13,"and are not like Moses, who used to put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel might not see when the vanishing glory ended;"
47,3,14,"but their thinking was dulled. For to this day the same veil remains unlifted when the old covenant is read; because it is done away only in Christ."
47,3,15,"To this day when Moses is read the veil lies on their hearts;"
47,3,16,"but when they turn to the Lord the veil is taken away."
47,3,17,"The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty."
47,3,18,"And we all, with unveiled face, reflecting the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same likeness from glory to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord."
47,4,1,"THEREFORE, having this service through God's mercy, we are not downhearted,"
47,4,2,"but we have renounced shameful secret things, not living in craftiness nor adulterating God's message, but by the openness of truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God."
47,4,3,"If our good news is veiled, it is veiled to those who are going to ruin,"
47,4,4,"in whom the god of this world has blinded the thinking of the unbelieving so that the light of the glorious good news of Christ, who is the image of God, may not shine in."
47,4,5,"For we are not proclaiming ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake."
47,4,6,"Because it is the God who said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts bringing the light of the glorious knowledge of God in the face of Christ."
47,4,7,"But we have this treasure in earthen jars, that the surpassing power may be God's and not ours \'97"
47,4,8,"in every way distressed, but not reduced to straits, perplexed, but not in despair,"
47,4,9,"persecuted, but not forsaken, cast down, but not destroyed,"
47,4,10,"always bearing about in our bodies the death of Jesus that the life also of Jesus may be manifest in our bodies."
47,4,11,"For we, though living, are always delivered up to death for Jesus' sake, that also the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh."
47,4,12,"So death works in us, but life in you."
47,4,13,"Having the same spirit of faith, as it is written, I believed, therefore I spoke, we too believe and therefore speak,"
47,4,14,"knowing that he who raised up Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus and place us in his presence with you."
47,4,15,"For all things are for your sake, that grace abounding through many may overflow in thanksgiving to the glory of God."
47,4,16,"Therefore we are not downhearted, but even if our outward man is wasting away, yet our inward man is renewed day by day."
47,4,17,"For our momentary and light distress is working out for us a far surpassing and eternal weight of glory"
47,4,18,"while we contemplate not the things that are seen, but the things unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things unseen are eternal."
47,5,1,"FOR we know that if this tent, our earthly home, is thrown down, we have a building of God, a home not made by hands, eternal in the heavens."
47,5,2,"For in this we sigh in earnest desire to put on our dwelling that comes from heaven,"
47,5,3,"since if we put that on we shall not be found naked."
47,5,4,"For while we are in this tent we sigh being burdened, not that we wish to be unclothed, but to put on the other, that what is mortal may be swallowed up in life."
47,5,5,"He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, and he has given to us the pledge of the Spirit."
47,5,6,"So being always of good courage and knowing that while living at home in the body we are living in a foreign land away from the Lord \'97"
47,5,7,"for we walk by faith, not by sight \'97"
47,5,8,"I say we are of good courage and wish rather to live in the land foreign to the body and be at home with the Lord."
47,5,9,"Therefore also we are ambitious to be pleasing to him, whether at home with him or in this foreign land."
47,5,10,"For we must all appear as we truly are before the judgment seat of Christ, that each may receive the award for what he has done with his body, according to his actions, whether good or bad."
47,5,11,"Knowing, therefore, the fear of the Lord, we are persuading men. What we are is plain to God, and I hope that it is also plain to your consciences."
47,5,12,"We are not recommending ourselves again to you, but giving occasion to you for boasting on our behalf, that you may have it to use against those who boast of appearances and not of heart."
47,5,13,"For if we were out of our minds it was for God, and if we are sane it is for you."
47,5,14,"For the love of Christ impels us, convinced of this, that if one died for all, then all died,"
47,5,15,"and he died for all that the living may no longer live for themselves, but for him who died for them and was raised again."
47,5,16,"So we, from now on, know no man according to the flesh. Even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him so no more."
47,5,17,"So if any one is in Christ he is a new creature. The old things have passed away, they have become new."
47,5,18,"And all things are from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and given to us the service of reconciliation \'97"
47,5,19,"to proclaim that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting against men their sins, and that he has committed to us the message of reconciliation."
47,5,20,"So we are ambassadors for Christ, as if God were appealing to you through us. We pray you on Christ's behalf to be reconciled to God."
47,5,21,"Him who knew no sin God made sin for our sake that we might become the righteousness of God in him."
47,6,1,"AS God's fellow workers we also beg you not to receive his grace fruitlessly."
47,6,2,"For he says, At a favorable time I heard you and on a day of salvation I helped you. Now is a particularly favorable time, now is a day of salvation."
47,6,3,"We give no occasion for stumbling to any one that our service may not be blamed,"
47,6,4,"but in everything we commend ourselves as God's servants in great patience, in distresses, in necessities, in hardships,"
47,6,5,"in floggings, in prisons, in riots, in toils, in sleepless nights, in fastings,"
47,6,6,"with purity, with knowledge, with long-suffering, with kindness, with the Holy Spirit, with sincere love,"
47,6,7,"with the message of truth, with the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and the left,"
47,6,8,"by honor and shame, by slander and praise; as deceivers yet true,"
47,6,9,"as unknown yet well known, as dying and yet we are living, as chastised yet not put to death,"
47,6,10,"as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing yet owning all things."
47,6,11,"Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians, our heart expands itself."
47,6,12,"You find no narrowness in us, the narrowness is in your own sympathies."
47,6,13,"As a fair return, I am speaking as to my children, let your hearts expand."
47,6,14,"Do not be yoked up, like unmatched animals, with unbelievers. For what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness,"
47,6,15,"or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what share has a believer with an unbeliever?"
47,6,16,"What agreement has the Temple of God with idols? For we are the Temple of the living God, as God said, I will dwell in them and walk among them, and I will be their God and they shall be my people."
47,6,17,"Therefore come out from the midst of them and be separate, says the Lord, and do not touch an unclean thing, and I will receive you"
47,6,18,"and will be a Father to you and you shall be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord, the Ruler of all."
47,7,1,"HAVING then these promises, beloved, let us purify ourselves from every defilement of flesh or spirit, in reverence for God making our holiness complete."
47,7,2,"Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one; we have injured no one; we have taken advantage of no one."
47,7,3,"I am not saying this to condemn you, for I have already said that you have such a place in our hearts that we are ready to die with you or to live with you."
47,7,4,"Great is my frankness in speaking to you; great is my boasting of you; I am filled with encouragement, running over with joy at every distress of ours."
47,7,5,"For since we came to Macedonia our flesh has had no rest, but we have been distressed in every way, conflicts without, fears within."
47,7,6,"But God, who encourages the depressed, encouraged us by the coming of Titus,"
47,7,7,"and not by his coming only, but also by the encouragement by which he was encouraged about you. He told us of your longing for me, your lamentation, your zeal in my behalf, so that I rejoice the more."
47,7,8,"For if I grieved you in my letter I do not regret it, though I did regret it, seeing that that letter grieved you even for a time,"
47,7,9,"but I am glad now, not that you were grieved, but that your grief led to a change of heart. You were grieved as God approves so that you should in nothing suffer loss from us."
47,7,10,"For such grief as God approves works a change of heart leading to salvation and is never to be regretted. But the grief of the world results in death."
47,7,11,"Notice this very grieving as God approves, how great earnestness resulted from it in your case, what effort to defend yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what just punishment! In everything you showed yourselves blameless in the matter."
47,7,12,"So although I wrote to you, I did it not for the sake of him who did the wrong, nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong, but that your earnestness for us might be made plain to you before God."
47,7,13,"On this account we have been encouraged. In addition to this encouragement of ours, we rejoiced very much more over the joy of Titus because his spirit has been refreshed by you all,"
47,7,14,"for if I have made any boast regarding you I have not been put to shame, but as we spoke everything in truth to you so our boasting over Titus turned out the truth."
47,7,15,"And his affections go out more strongly to you when he remembers the obedience of you all, how with reverence and trembling you received him."
47,7,16,"I am glad to be in every respect of good courage regarding you."
47,8,1,"I MUST tell you, brethren, of the grace of God that has been given to the churches of Macedonia,"
47,8,2,"that in a great trial of distress their abundant joy and their deep poverty have abounded in the wealth of their liberality."
47,8,3,"For according to their ability, I bear witness, and beyond their ability, of their own accord,"
47,8,4,"with great urgency they begged of us the favor of fellowship in the service for the holy,"
47,8,5,"and this not as we had hoped, but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us through the will of God."
47,8,6,"Therefore we encouraged Titus that as he had begun so he should complete this grace among you."
47,8,7,"But as you excel in every way, in faith and speech and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love you learned from us, be sure to excel in this grace also."
47,8,8,"I speak not by way of command, but testing the genuineness of your love by the earnestness of others."
47,8,9,"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich yet for your sake he became poor, that you by his poverty might become rich."
47,8,10,"In this I give my opinion, for this is advantageous for you, since a year ago you were first to begin not only the doing but the wanting to do anything."
47,8,11,"But now complete the doing, that as there was a readiness in willing so there may be a completion according to your means."
47,8,12,"For if there is first the readiness, a gift is acceptable according to what a man has, not according to what he has not."
47,8,13,"I do not mean that others shall have relief and you shall have trouble,"
47,8,14,"but by equality at the present time your abundance may supply their need so that their abundance may come at your need \'97 that there may be equality,"
47,8,15,"as it is written, He who gathered much had nothing over and he who gathered little had no lack."
47,8,16,"Thanks be to God who puts into the heart of Titus the same interest in you."
47,8,17,"For he welcomed our appeal, but being unusually interested comes to you of his own choice."
47,8,18,"With him we are sending the brother whose praise for service to the good news has spread through all the churches,"
47,8,19,"and not only that, but he was appointed by the churches as our fellow traveler in this gracious errand carried out by us to the glory of the Lord himself and by our own eager desire."
47,8,20,"We are taking care that no one shall blame us for our administration of this bountiful fund,"
47,8,21,"for we are providing arrangements honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men."
47,8,22,"We are sending along with them also our brother whose earnestness we have tested many times in many ways, and who is now especially earnest because of his great confidence in you."
47,8,23,"If any one asks about Titus, he is my intimate friend and fellow worker for you. If it is our brethren, they are the messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ."
47,8,24,"Show them in the sight of the churches your love and the ground of our boasting to them about you."
47,9,1,"REGARDING the service to the holy, it is superfluous for me to write to you."
47,9,2,"For I know your readiness and I am boasting about you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago, and your zeal has stimulated the most of them."
47,9,3,"I am sending the brethren that our boasting about you may not be proved in this matter an empty boast, so that you may be ready as I have said,"
47,9,4,"and if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we, not to say you, may not be made ashamed of this confidence."
47,9,5,"So I think it necessary to urge the brethren to go on in advance to you and prepare before-hand your promised gift, that it may be ready as a gift and not as if extorted."
47,9,6,"Remember this, he who sows sparingly will reap sparingly and he who sows bountifully will reap bountifully."
47,9,7,"Let each give as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly nor of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver."
47,9,8,"God is able to make every blessing abound for you so that having in everything always all that you need, you may abound in every good work,"
47,9,9,"as it is written, He scattered, he gave to the poor, his righteousness endures forever."
47,9,10,"He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and make abundant your seed and will increase the fruits of your righteousness."
47,9,11,"You will be enriched in everything so that you will have all liberality which through our agency causes thanksgiving to God."
47,9,12,"For the performance of this sacred service not only supplies the needs of the holy, but also overflows to God in many thanksgivings."
47,9,13,"By the proof afforded by this service men are led to glorify God for your fidelity to your profession of faith in the good news of Christ, and for the liberality of your contributions toward them and toward all."
47,9,14,"In their prayers in your behalf they pour out their longing love for you because of the surpassing grace of God that is upon you."
47,9,15,"Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift!"
47,10,1,"I MYSELF, Paul, beg you by the gentleness and sweet reasonableness of Christ \'97 I who to your face am humble when among you, but when absent am bold toward you \'97"
47,10,2,"I pray that I may not when present have to be bold with the confidence with which I expect to show my courage against some who think of us as living according to the flesh."
47,10,3,"For although living in the flesh we do not carry on our warfare according to the flesh,"
47,10,4,"for the weapons of our warfare are not weapons of the flesh, but powerful under God for the destruction of fortresses."
47,10,5,"We overthrow reasonings and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought into obedience to Christ"
47,10,6,"and are ready to take vengeance upon every disobedience when your obedience is complete."
47,10,7,"Look at what is right before your eyes. If any one is confident that he belongs to Christ, let him again consider this regarding himself, that just as he belongs to Christ so also do we."
47,10,8,"For if I boast somewhat excessively of our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for pulling you down, I shall not be ashamed."
47,10,9,"Let me not seem as if meaning to frighten you by letters."
47,10,10,"Because, His letters, they say, are mighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak and his speaking amounts to nothing."
47,10,11,"Let such a person consider this, that what we are in words by letters when absent such we will be in deeds when present."
47,10,12,"We do not venture to class ourselves or compare ourselves with some of those who are commending themselves. But they, measuring themselves among themselves and comparing themselves with themselves, do not understand."
47,10,13,"We will not boast beyond measure, but according to the measure of the measuring rod which God assigned to us, and that reaches as far as you."
47,10,14,"For we are not stretching ourselves, as if we did not reach to you, for we were the first to reach you with the good news of Christ."
47,10,15,"We are not boasting beyond measure in the labors of others, but we have hope that as your faith grows we may have larger influence among you according to our measure and beyond,"
47,10,16,"so that we may tell the good news to the regions lying beyond you and not boast of things already done in some other man's territory."
47,10,17,"Let him who boasts boast in the Lord."
47,10,18,"For it is not he who commends himself that is approved, but whom the Lord commends."
47,11,1,"O THAT you would bear with me in a little foolishness. Yes, bear with me."
47,11,2,"For I am jealous over you with the jealousy of God, for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ."
47,11,3,"But I fear that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts may be led away from sincerity and purity toward Christ."
47,11,4,"For if some newcomer proclaims another Jesus whom we did not proclaim, or if you receive a different kind of spirit which you did not receive, or a different good news which you did not welcome, you bear with him finely."
47,11,5,"I consider that I am in nothing inferior to the most eminent apostles."
47,11,6,"If I am an ordinary man in speaking, still I am not in knowledge, but in everything we made that altogether clear to you."
47,11,7,"Did I commit a sin when I humbled myself that you might be exalted, because I proclaimed to you the good news of God without pay?"
47,11,8,"I robbed other churches by taking wages for serving you,"
47,11,9,"and when I was with you and in need I was not a burden to any one, for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied my need. In every way I kept myself from being a burden to you, and shall keep myself so."
47,11,10,"As the truth of Christ is in me, this boast of mine shall not be stopped in the region of Achaia."
47,11,11,"Why? Because I do not love you? God knows."
47,11,12,"But what I am doing I shall do so as to cut away all ground of attack from those who wish ground, and that in what they boast of they may be found just like us."
47,11,13,"For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ."
47,11,14,"And no wonder, for Satan himself disguises himself as an angel of light."
47,11,15,"So it is no great thing if his servants too disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will be according to their deeds."
47,11,16,"I say again, let no one think me foolish. But, even if so, receive me as foolish, that I too may boast a little."
47,11,17,"What I am saying I am not saying by the Lord's command, but as it were in foolishness, in this confident boasting."
47,11,18,"Since many are boasting according to the flesh, I too will boast,"
47,11,19,"for you who are wise bear pleasantly with the foolish."
47,11,20,"You bear it if any one enslaves you, if any one devours you, if any one takes possession of you, if any one exalts himself, if any one strikes you in the face."
47,11,21,"I say it with shame as if we had been weak. But in whatever any one is bold"
47,11,22,"Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descended from Abraham? So am I."
47,11,23,"Are they servants of Christ?"
47,11,24,"From Jews five times I received forty stripes less one,"
47,11,25,"three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was ship-wrecked, a night and day I have been in the deep;"
47,11,26,"in journeys often, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own race, in perils from Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the open country, in perils on the sea, in perils among false brethren;"
47,11,27,"in toil and labor, in many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness."
47,11,28,"Aside, from other things there is that which weighs on me daily, anxiety for all the churches."
47,11,29,"Who is weak and I am not weak? Who stumbles and I am not burning?"
47,11,30,"If there must be boasting, I will boast of the things that show my weakness."
47,11,31,"The God and Father of the Lord Jesus knows, he who is blessed forever, that I am not lying."
47,11,32,"In Damascus the Governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes to arrest me,"
47,11,33,"and through a window I was lowered in a basket and escaped from his hands."
47,12,1,"I MUST boast, though it is unprofitable. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord."
47,12,2,"I know a man in Christ fourteen years ago \'97 whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not; God knows \'97 such a man caught up to the third heaven."
47,12,3,"I know such a man \'97 whether in the body or out of the body I know not; God knows \'97"
47,12,4,"that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for man to speak."
47,12,5,"Of such a one I will boast, but of myself I will not boast except of my weaknesses."
47,12,6,"Even if I choose to boast I shall not be foolish, for I shall speak the truth. But I guard myself that no one may think of me beyond what he sees me to be, or hears from me,"
47,12,7,"and because of the surpassing nature of the revelations. For this reason, that I should not be puffed up, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan, to torment me, so that I should not be puffed up."
47,12,8,"Regarding this I three times begged the Lord that it might leave me."
47,12,9,"But he has said to me,"
47,12,10,"Therefore I rejoice in weaknesses, in rough treatment, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong."
47,12,11,"I have become foolish; you made me. For I ought to have been recommended by you. For in nothing have I been inferior to the most eminent apostles, even though I am nothing."
47,12,12,"The signs of an apostle were performed among you in all patience by miracles and wonders and deeds of power."
47,12,13,"What is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the churches except that I was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong."
47,12,14,"Now this third time I am ready to come to you, and I shall not be a burden to you. For I am not seeking yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up money for the parents, but the parents for the children."
47,12,15,"And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you too much, am I loved the less?"
47,12,16,"Be that as it may, I was not a burden to you. But being crafty I caught you with cunning?"
47,12,17,"Did I take advantage of you through any one of those I sent to you?"
47,12,18,"I begged Titus to go, and I sent along with him the brother. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not act in the same spirit and walk in the same steps?"
47,12,19,"Are you thinking all this while that we are defending ourselves to you? We are speaking before God in Christ. All this, beloved, is to build you up."
47,12,20,"For I am afraid that when I come I shall not find you such as I wish, and I myself may not be found by you such as you wish. I am afraid that there may be strife, jealousy, anger, rivalry, slanders, whisperings, conceit, disorders."
47,12,21,"I am afraid that when I come again my God may humble me in your presence, and that I shall grieve over many of those who have been long sinning and have not repented of the impurity and unchastity and sensuality which they have practiced."
47,13,1,"THIS third time I am coming to you. By the evidence of two witnesses, or three, every matter shall be proved."
47,13,2,"Those who have been long sinning and all the rest I have forewarned and now forewarn, when I was present with you the second time and now when absent, that if I come again I shall not spare;"
47,13,3,"since you are eager to have a test of Christ speaking in me. He is not weak toward you, but powerful among you."
47,13,4,"He was crucified in weakness, but he is living by the power of God. And we are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God for you."
47,13,5,"Test yourselves whether you are in the faith, put yourselves to the proof. Are you not conscious that Jesus Christ is in you? He is, unless you cannot stand the test."
47,13,6,"I hope that you know that we are not unable to stand the test."
47,13,7,"I pray to God that you may do nothing evil, not in order that we may seem to stand the test, but in order that you may do the right, though we should seem unable to stand the test."
47,13,8,"For we cannot do anything against the truth; our power is for the truth."
47,13,9,"We rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. This we are praying for, your all-round character."
47,13,10,"For this reason I am writing this while absent, so that when present I may not act with severity in the use of the authority which the Lord gave me for building you up, not for pulling you down."
47,13,11,"Now, brethren, farewell. Be fully equipped; take courage; be of one mind; live in peace; then the God of love and peace will be with you."
47,13,12,"Greet one another with a holy kiss."
47,13,13,"All the holy send greetings."
47,13,14,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."
48,1,1,"PAUL an apostle \'97 not from men or through men, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead \'97"
48,1,2,"and all the brethren with me, to the churches of Galatia:"
48,1,3,"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,"
48,1,4,"who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present wicked world according to the will of our God and Father!"
48,1,5,"To him be glory through the ages of the ages! Amen."
48,1,6,"I am astonished that you are so quickly changing over from him who called you by the grace of Christ to a different kind of good news,"
48,1,7,"though it is not another good news. But there are some who are perplexing you and wishing to pervert the good news of Christ."
48,1,8,"But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should bring you any good news different from what we did bring you, let him be accursed!"
48,1,9,"As I said before, I say now again, if any one brings you good news different from what you have received, let him be accursed!"
48,1,10,"Am I now trying to please men or God? If I were still trying to please men I should not be Christ's servant."
48,1,11,"For I assure you, brethren, that the good news which I brought is not of man's devising."
48,1,12,"For neither did I receive it from man nor was I taught it through man, but through a revelation of Jesus Christ."
48,1,13,"You have heard of my former life in Judaism, that I furiously persecuted the church of God and made havoc of it,"
48,1,14,"and I went further in Judaism than many of my own age and race, being intensely zealous for the traditions of my forefathers."
48,1,15,"But when he who had appointed me when I was in my mother's womb, and had called me by his grace,"
48,1,16,"was pleased to reveal his Son in me that I might tell the good news of him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not consult with flesh and blood,"
48,1,17,"nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and came back to Damascus."
48,1,18,"Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter and stayed with him fifteen days."
48,1,19,"But I saw no other one of the apostles, though I did see James the Lord's brother."
48,1,20,"In what I am writing to you, before God I am not lying."
48,1,21,"Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia."
48,1,22,"I was not known by face to the churches of Christ in Judaea."
48,1,23,"Only they had heard that he who used to persecute us is now telling the good news of the faith of which he once made havoc,"
48,1,24,"and they glorified God on my account."
48,2,1,"THEN after fourteen years I again went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking along Titus."
48,2,2,"I went up by revelation, and I stated to them the good news which I proclaim among the Gentiles. But I did this privately before those who were most esteemed, that I might not be running, or have run, to no Purpose."
48,2,3,"But even Titus, who was with me and was a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised,"
48,2,4,"though it was suggested on account of false brethren who had been brought in, who had crept in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to enslave us."
48,2,5,"But we did not yield in subjection to them even for an hour, that the truth of the good news might continue with you."
48,2,6,"But from those who were esteemed to be something \'97 whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God does not regard the social standing of a man \'97 those who were most esteemed did not impart to me anything additional."
48,2,7,"But, on the contrary, seeing that I was entrusted with the good news for the uncircumcision as Peter was for the circumcision,"
48,2,8,"for he who had worked in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcision had worked in me for the Gentiles,"
48,2,9,"recognizing the grace given to me, James, Cephas, and John, who were regarded as pillars, gave the right hand of fellowship to me and Barnabas, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision."
48,2,10,"Only they wished us to remember the poor. This very thing I also was earnest in doing."
48,2,11,"But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he had been justly censured."
48,2,12,"For before certain persons came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision."
48,2,13,"And the rest of the Jews practiced the same hypocrisy with him, so that even Barnabas was led off with them in their hypocrisy."
48,2,14,"But when I saw that they were not walking straight according to the truth of the good news, I said to Cephas before them all, If you who are a Jew are living like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?"
48,2,15,"We who are Jews by nature and not sinners of the Gentiles,"
48,2,16,"knowing that a man is not declared righteous because of works of law, but through faith in Christ Jesus, we also have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be declared righteous because of faith in Christ, and not because of works of law, for because of works of law no human being will be declared righteous."
48,2,17,"If while seeking to be declared righteous in Christ we ourselves are found sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Never."
48,2,18,"For if I am building up again what I pulled down, I show myself as a transgressor."
48,2,19,"For I through law died to law that I might live to God."
48,2,20,"I have been crucified with Christ. I am living, yet no longer I, but Christ is living in me. The life that I am now living in flesh I am living by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."
48,2,21,"I do not make nothing of the grace of God, for if righteousness is through law, then Christ died for nothing."
48,3,1,"O THOUGHTLESS Galatians, who has bewitched you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was pictured crucified?"
48,3,2,"Only this I wish to learn from you: Was it because of works of law that you received the Spirit, or because of hearing with faith?"
48,3,3,"Are you so thoughtless? After beginning with spirit are you now finishing with flesh?"
48,3,4,"Have you suffered such things to no purpose? \'97 if it is to no purpose."
48,3,5,"He who supplies to you the Spirit and works miracles among you, is he doing it because of works of law or because of hearing with faith,"
48,3,6,"just as Abraham had faith in God and it was credited to him for righteousness?"
48,3,7,"You know, then, that those who are of faith \'97 they are children of Abraham."
48,3,8,"For the Scripture, foreseeing that God would declare the Gentiles righteous because of faith, announced the good news in advance to Abraham, In you all the Gentiles will be blessed."
48,3,9,"So then those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham."
48,3,10,"For all who are of the works of law are under a curse, for it is written, Cursed is every one who does not abide by all the precepts of the book of the Law and do them."
48,3,11,"But that by law no one is declared righteous before God is plain, because, He who is righteous by faith shall live."
48,3,12,"But the Law is not of faith, but He who does these things shall live by them."
48,3,13,"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse for our sake, for it is written, Cursed is every one who hangs on a tree,"
48,3,14,"in order that the blessing of Abraham might in Jesus Christ come on the Gentiles, that they might receive through faith the promise of the Spirit."
48,3,15,"Brethren, I am speaking humanly, a ratified covenant, although but a man's, no one can set aside or add to."
48,3,16,"But the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, and to offsprings, as meaning many, but as if meaning one, and to your offspring, who is Christ."
48,3,17,"I mean this, a covenant ratified by God, the Law that came four hundred and thirty years afterward does not annul, so as to defeat the promise."
48,3,18,"For if the inheritance is by law, it is no longer by promise. But God granted it to Abraham by promise."
48,3,19,"Why then was the Law? It was added later to make transgressions, until the Offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was arranged through angels by the hand of a mediator."
48,3,20,"A mediator does not belong to one person, but God is one."
48,3,21,"Is the Law then against the promises of God? Never! For if a law had been given which could give life, then really righteousness would have come by law."
48,3,22,"But the Scripture has shut up all under sin that the promise based on faith in Jesus Christ may be given to those who have faith."
48,3,23,"Before faith came we were guarded under law, shut up waiting for the faith that was to be revealed."
48,3,24,"Thus the Law became our tutor leading us to Christ, that we might be declared righteous by faith."
48,3,25,"Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor."
48,3,26,"You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus."
48,3,27,"All who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ."
48,3,28,"There cannot be Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female: for you all are one in Christ Jesus."
48,3,29,"If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring and heirs according to the promise."
48,4,1,"I SAY that as long as the heir is under age he differs in nothing from a slave, though he be owner of all."
48,4,2,"But he is under guardians and managers until the day appointed by the father."
48,4,3,"So we, when we were under age, were enslaved under the elementary lessons of the world;"
48,4,4,"but, when the fullness of time came, God sent forth his Son born of a woman, born under the Law,"
48,4,5,"that he might redeem those who were under Law, that we might receive the recognition as sons."
48,4,6,"Because you are sons, God has sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son crying Abba, Father."
48,4,7,"So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then also an heir, through God's act."
48,4,8,"At the time when you did not know God you were enslaved to what by nature are not gods."
48,4,9,"But now that you know God, or rather have been known by God, how are you turning back to the weak and beggarly elementary lessons to which you wish to be slaves again?"
48,4,10,"You observe days and months and seasons and years."
48,4,11,"You make me afraid that I have labored over you uselessly."
48,4,12,"Become like me, brethren, I beg of you, for I became like you. You have not wronged me in anything."
48,4,13,"You know that because of weakness of the flesh I told you the good news at first."
48,4,14,"And you did not despise or spurn what was a trial to you in my bodily condition, but welcomed me as you would an angel of God, as you would Christ Jesus."
48,4,15,"Where now is the blessing you pronounced on me? For I bear you witness that if it had been possible you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me."
48,4,16,"Have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth?"
48,4,17,"They are paying court to you, but not honorably. No, they wish to shut you out, so that you may pay court to them."
48,4,18,"It is honorable to be courted in an honorable matter always, and not only when I am with you,"
48,4,19,"my children, for whom I again am suffering birth pangs until Christ is formed in you."
48,4,20,"Would that I could be present with you now and could change my tone, for I am at a loss about you."
48,4,21,"Tell me, you who wish to be under law, do you not hear the Law?"
48,4,22,"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one born of the slave girl and one born of the free wife."
48,4,23,"But he who was born of the slave girl was born according to the flesh, while he who was born of the free wife was born by promise."
48,4,24,"This is an allegory. For these women are the two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery. This is Hagar."
48,4,25,"Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia. She represents the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery along with her children."
48,4,26,"But the Jerusalem on high is free and she is our mother."
48,4,27,"For it is written, Rejoice, O barren one, you who do not bear! Break forth and shout, you who feel no birth pangs! For many are the children of the desolate \'97 more than those of her who has a husband."
48,4,28,"But you, brethren, are, as Isaac was, children of promise."
48,4,29,"But just as then he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now."
48,4,30,"But what says the Scripture? Cast out the slave girl and her son. For the son of the slave girl shall not inherit along with the son of the free wife."
48,4,31,"Therefore, brethren, we are not children of a slave girl, but of the free wife."
48,5,1,"STAND firm, therefore, in the freedom with which Christ set us free, and do not wear any yoke of slavery."
48,5,2,"See, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no use to you."
48,5,3,"I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is under obligation to carry out the whole Law."
48,5,4,"You have put an end to Christ's work for you, you who are declared righteous by law; you have fallen away from grace."
48,5,5,"For we in the Spirit because of faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness."
48,5,6,"For in Christ Jesus neither has circumcision any value nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love."
48,5,7,"You were running finely. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?"
48,5,8,"The persuasion was not from him who called you."
48,5,9,"A little yeast sets the whole lump fermenting."
48,5,10,"I am persuaded in regard to you in the Lord that you will have no other mind. He who is troubling you must bear his condemnation, whoever he may be."
48,5,11,"But I, brethren, if I am still proclaiming circumcision, why am I persecuted? Then the offensiveness of the cross has been done away."
48,5,12,"Would that those who are troubling you would even cut off all!"
48,5,13,"For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not let your freedom be an opportunity for the flesh, but in love be servants to one another."
48,5,14,"For the whole Law is summed up in one word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
48,5,15,"But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not destroyed by one another."
48,5,16,"I say, walk in the Spirit and you will not carry out the passions of the flesh."
48,5,17,"For the flesh has passions contrary to the Spirit and the Spirit contrary to the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do whatever you wish."
48,5,18,"But if you are led by the Spirit you are not under law."
48,5,19,"The works of the flesh are obvious, such as unchastity, impurity, indecency,"
48,5,20,"idolatry, magic, hatred, strife, jealousy, anger, rivalries, dissensions, factions,"
48,5,21,"envyings, drinking bouts, revelries, and the like. Of these I tell you beforehand, as I have already told you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."
48,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, slowness to anger, kindness, benevolence, faithfulness,"
48,5,23,"gentleness, self-control; against such there is no law."
48,5,24,"Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its emotions and passions."
48,5,25,"If we are living in the Spirit let us direct our lives by the Spirit."
48,5,26,"Let us not be vainglorious, irritating one another, envying one another."
48,6,1,"BRETHREN, if a man is surprised in some sin, you who are spiritual are to restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, each looking out for himself to avoid being tempted."
48,6,2,"Bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ."
48,6,3,"If any one thinks that he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself."
48,6,4,"Let each one test his own work and then he will have his reason for boasting in himself alone and not in another."
48,6,5,"For each must bear his own load."
48,6,6,"Let him who is taught the message share with his teacher in all good things."
48,6,7,"Do not be deceived; God is not mocked; what a man sows that he will also reap."
48,6,8,"For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap decay; but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap life eternal."
48,6,9,"Let us not grow discouraged in doing what is noble, for in due time we shall reap if we do not grow faint."
48,6,10,"So then as we have opportunity let us work for the good of all men, and especially of those who belong to the household of the faith."
48,6,11,"See with what great letters I write with my own hand."
48,6,12,"All who wish to make a fair show in the flesh are trying to compel you to receive circumcision, but only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ."
48,6,13,"For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the Law, but they wish you to be circumcised in order to boast in your flesh."
48,6,14,"But let me never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world is crucified to me and I to the world."
48,6,15,"For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation."
48,6,16,"All who walk by this rule \'97 may peace and mercy be on them, and on the Israel of God!"
48,6,17,"For the future let no one trouble me; for I bear on my body the brands of Jesus."
48,6,18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits, brethren. Amen."
49,1,1,"PAUL, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the Holy who are at Ephesus, faithful in Christ Jesus:"
49,1,2,"Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
49,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly heights in Christ,"
49,1,4,"even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and spotless before him in love."
49,1,5,"He predestined us to recognition as sons to himself through Jesus Christ according to the kindness of his will,"
49,1,6,"to the praise of his glorious grace which he bestowed on us in the Beloved,"
49,1,7,"in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins, according to the wealth of his loving kindness"
49,1,8,"which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding."
49,1,9,"He has made known to us the mystery of his will according to his grace which he purposed in him"
49,1,10,"for the government of the fullness of the ages, to bring to unity all things in Christ, both things in the heavens and things on the earth."
49,1,11,"In him we were predestined according to the plan of him who works in all things according to the purpose of his will,"
49,1,12,"and we were made God's heritage in order that we might bring praise to his glory \'97 we who first have fixed our hope on Christ."
49,1,13,"In him you also, after hearing the message of the truth, the good news of your salvation, and putting your faith in him, were sealed by the promised Holy Spirit,"
49,1,14,"which is the pledge of our inheritance in anticipation of the full redemption of God's own people to the praise of his glory."
49,1,15,"For this reason I also, since hearing of your faith in Jesus and your love to all the saints,"
49,1,16,"never cease giving thanks for you when I mention you in my prayers,"
49,1,17,"that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father most glorious, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of himself,"
49,1,18,"enlightening the eyes of your heart, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the glorious wealth of his inheritance in the holy,"
49,1,19,"and what the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe according to the inworking of his vast might,"
49,1,20,"which he put forth in Christ when he raised him from the dead and made him sit at his own right hand in the heavenly heights,"
49,1,21,"far above every archangel and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this world but also in the world to come."
49,1,22,"He put all things under his feet and placed him as head over all for the church,"
49,1,23,"which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all."
49,2,1,"YOU also God raised to life when you were dead in misdeeds and sins"
49,2,2,"in which you once walked, following the ways of this age of the world, led by the Ruler of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience."
49,2,3,"Among these we all lived once in the passions of our flesh and of our thoughts, and we were by nature children of wrath like the rest."
49,2,4,"But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us,"
49,2,5,"even when we were dead in misdeeds, made us alive along with Christ \'97 by grace we have been saved \'97"
49,2,6,"and raised us up with him and made us sit with him in the heavenly heights in Christ Jesus,"
49,2,7,"that he might show in the ages to come the surpassing richness of his grace in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus."
49,2,8,"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,"
49,2,9,"not of works, that no one may boast."
49,2,10,"For we are his work, formed in Christ Jesus for good works in which God had prepared beforehand to have us live."
49,2,11,"Therefore remember that once you were Gentiles in the flesh and were called uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision in the flesh, made by hands,"
49,2,12,"and that you were then apart from Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, without hope and without God in the world."
49,2,13,"But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far have become near by the blood of Christ."
49,2,14,"For he is our peace. He has made both Jew and Gentile one and has broken down the dividing wall, the enmity."
49,2,15,"In his own flesh he has ended the force of the law of commandments in ordinances in order to make the two, in himself, into one new man, thus making peace,"
49,2,16,"and in order to reconcile both in one body to God through his cross, by slaying the enmity by it."
49,2,17,"And he came and brought the good news of peace to you who were far and peace to those who were near."
49,2,18,"For through him we, both Jews and Gentiles, have access through one Spirit to the Father."
49,2,19,"So then you are no longer strangers and resident aliens, but fellow citizens with the holy and members of the household of God,"
49,2,20,"built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the corner stone."
49,2,21,"In him all the building, framed together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord,"
49,2,22,"in whom you also are being built for a dwelling of God in the Spirit."
49,3,1,"FOR this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles, \'97"
49,3,2,"if you have heard of the gracious commission which God has given me to you,"
49,3,3,"that by revelation the mystery has been disclosed to me, as I wrote before briefly,"
49,3,4,"In reading that letter you can learn my understanding in the mystery of Christ,"
49,3,5,"a mystery which was not disclosed in other generations to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit,"
49,3,6,"namely, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, fellow sharers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the good news,"
49,3,7,"of which I became a servant according to the free grace of God which was given me by the inworking of his power."
49,3,8,"To me, the least of all the holy, has this grace been given, to proclaim to the Gentiles the good news of the unsearchable riches of Christ"
49,3,9,"and to show what is the working of the mystery which has been hidden for ages in God, who created all things"
49,3,10,"in order to disclose now to the archangels and powers in the heavenly heights, through the church, the varied wisdom of God,"
49,3,11,"according to the eternal purpose which he has accomplished by Christ Jesus our Lord,"
49,3,12,"in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in him."
49,3,13,"So I beg you not to lose heart because of the distresses that come on me for your sake. They are a high honor to you."
49,3,14,"For this reason I bow my knees to the Father"
49,3,15,"from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,"
49,3,16,"that he may grant to you according to his glorious wealth to be strengthened with might through his Spirit in the inner man,"
49,3,17,"that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, and that you, rooted and founded in love,"
49,3,18,"may be able with all the holy to comprehend what is the breadth and length and height and depth \'97"
49,3,19,"yes, to know the love of Christ, which yet surpasses knowledge, and may be filled with all the fullness of God."
49,3,20,"To him who is able to do far beyond all we ask or think by the power that works in us,"
49,3,21,"to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus through all the generations of the ages! Amen."
49,4,1,"I, THE prisoner of the Lord, beg you, then, to live worthily of the calling with which you have been called,"
49,4,2,"with all modesty and gentleness, being slow to anger, bearing with one another in love,"
49,4,3,"earnest in keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
49,4,4,"There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called with one hope that belongs to your calling,"
49,4,5,"one Lord, one faith, one baptism,"
49,4,6,"one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
49,4,7,"To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ."
49,4,8,"Therefore it says, He ascended on high; he led away captives; he gave gifts to men."
49,4,9,"What does he ascended mean, except that he had descended into the lowest parts of the earth?"
49,4,10,"He who descended is also he who ascended high above all the heavens to fill all things."
49,4,11,"And he gave to some to be apostles, some prophets, some tellers of the good news, some shepherds and teachers,"
49,4,12,"for the equipment of the saints, for the work of service, for building up the body of Christ,"
49,4,13,"until we all attain oneness in the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, and the maturity of manhood and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."
49,4,14,"Then we shall be no longer children tossed and borne about by every wind of teaching through the trickery of men and craftiness in the devices of deceit,"
49,4,15,"but speaking the truth in love we shall grow wholly into him who is the head, Christ,"
49,4,16,"from whom the whole body framed together and strengthened by what every joint supplies vigorously, in the measure of each, makes growth in building itself up in love."
49,4,17,"This then I say and solemnly protest in the Lord: that you are no longer to live as the Gentiles live in vacancy of mind,"
49,4,18,"having their understanding darkened, aliens from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, and because of the hardness of their hearts."
49,4,19,"Lost to any sense of shame they have abandoned themselves to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness."
49,4,20,"But you have not so learned Christ,"
49,4,21,"if you have heard him and have been taught in him as the truth is in Jesus,"
49,4,22,"that you should put away the old man who belonged to your former way of life and was perishing in deluding passions,"
49,4,23,"and that you should be made new in the spirit of your minds"
49,4,24,"and put on the new man formed as God approves in the righteousness and holiness of truth."
49,4,25,"Therefore put aside lying and speak truth every one to his neighbor, for we are members one of another."
49,4,26,"Be angry and do not sin. Do not let the sun go down on your wrath,"
49,4,27,"neither give place for the Devil."
49,4,28,"He who steals must steal no longer, but rather he must labor, working with his own hands something good, so as to have something to share with any one in need."
49,4,29,"Let no vile word come out of your mouth, but, if anything, a good word for needed upbuilding of character to give grace to those who hear."
49,4,30,"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you have been sealed for the day of redemption."
49,4,31,"Let all bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and abusive language be put away from you with every kind of malice."
49,4,32,"Be kind to one another, sympathetic, forgiving one another just as God in Christ has forgiven you."
49,5,1,"BE imitators of God as beloved children"
49,5,2,"and live in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself for us, an offering and sacrifice to God yielding a fragrant odor."
49,5,3,"Unchastity or any kind of impurity or greediness must not be mentioned among you, as befits holy people;"
49,5,4,"nor should there be indecent and foolish talk or jesting, which are unbecoming, but rather thanksgiving."
49,5,5,"For you know well that no unchaste or impure person, no greedy person \'97 who is an idolater \'97 has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God."
49,5,6,"Let no one deceive you with empty words; for because of these things the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience."
49,5,7,"Do not, then, be partakers with them."
49,5,8,"For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live like children of light \'97"
49,5,9,"for the fruit of light appears in all generosity and righteousness and truth \'97"
49,5,10,"testing what is pleasing to the Lord,"
49,5,11,"and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them,"
49,5,12,"for the things that they do in secret it is shameful even to speak of."
49,5,13,"But all things when reproved are shown truly by the light, for everything shown truly is light."
49,5,14,"Therefore it says, Wake, O sleeper, and rise from the dead and Christ will give you light."
49,5,15,"Be strictly careful, then, how you live, not as unwise but as wise."
49,5,16,"Buy up the opportunity, because these are evil days."
49,5,17,"Therefore do not be thoughtless, but understand what is the Lord's will."
49,5,18,"Do not be drunk with wine, in which there is profligacy, but be full of the Spirit,"
49,5,19,"speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and playing the harp heartily to the Lord,"
49,5,20,"giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father."
49,5,21,"Be subject to one another in reverence for Christ,"
49,5,22,"wives to their own husbands as in the Lord,"
49,5,23,"because a man is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body."
49,5,24,"But as the church is subject to Christ, so wives are to their husbands in everything."
49,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it,"
49,5,26,"that he might make it holy, cleansing it by the washing with water according to his word,"
49,5,27,"that he might present to himself the church glorious, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and faultless."
49,5,28,"Thus ought men to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself,"
49,5,29,"for no one ever hates his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church,"
49,5,30,"for we are members of his body."
49,5,31,"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh."
49,5,32,"This mystery is great, but I am speaking of Christ and the church."
49,5,33,"But each one of you must love his own wife as himself, and the wife must reverence her husband."
49,6,1,"CHILDREN, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right."
49,6,2,"Honor your father and your mother. This is the first commandment with a promise,"
49,6,3,"That it may go well with you and you may be long-lived in the land."
49,6,4,"And you, fathers, do not irritate your children, but bring them up in the education and admonition of the Lord."
49,6,5,"Slaves, obey those who according to the flesh are your masters, with reverence and awe in singleness of your hearts as to Christ,"
49,6,6,"not with eye service as pleasers of men, but as Christ's slaves, doing the will of God in a whole-souled way,"
49,6,7,"giving service with cheerfulness as to the Lord and not to men,"
49,6,8,"knowing that whatever good thing each one does that he will be rewarded for by the Lord, whether he be slave or free."
49,6,9,"And you, masters, do the same by them, avoiding threats, knowing that the Master both of them and of you is in the heavens, and there is no partiality for rank with him."
49,6,10,"To conclude: Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might."
49,6,11,"Put on the complete armor of God so that you may be able to stand against the cunning arts of the Devil."
49,6,12,"For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the arch-angels, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly heights."
49,6,13,"Therefore take the complete armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and, after going through everything, to stand."
49,6,14,"Stand, then, belted with truth, wearing the breastplate of righteousness,"
49,6,15,"shod with the readiness of the good news of peace."
49,6,16,"In every event take up the shield of faith by which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the Evil One,"
49,6,17,"and accept the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."
49,6,18,"Pray at all times in the Spirit with all manner of prayer and entreaty; be awake to this with all intentness and with prayer for all the holy"
49,6,19,"and in my behalf, that words may be given to me when I open my month to make known with fearlessness the mystery of the good news,"
49,6,20,"for which I am an ambassador in chains, that I may tell it fearlessly as I ought."
49,6,21,"That you also may know my situation, what I am doing, Tychicus the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord,"
49,6,22,"whom I am sending to you for this very purpose, will tell you everything, so that you may know the news of me and he may encourage your hearts."
49,6,23,"Peace to the brethren and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
49,6,24,"Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with undying love!"
50,1,1,"PAUL and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the Holy in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with Bishops and Deacons:"
50,1,2,"Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
50,1,3,"I thank my God for all your remembrance of me,"
50,1,4,"always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy"
50,1,5,"for your fellowship in spreading the good news from the first day until now,"
50,1,6,"being confident of this very thing, that he who has begun the good work in you will carry it on to completion on the day of Christ Jesus."
50,1,7,"So it is right for me to think of you all, because you have me in your hearts, and in my chains and in my defense and in establishing the good news you are all sharers in my privilege."
50,1,8,"For God is my witness how much I long for you all in the affections of Christ Jesus."
50,1,9,"And this is my prayer that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all insight,"
50,1,10,"so that you may discriminate between the things that differ, that you may be pure and blameless in the day of Christ,"
50,1,11,"filled with the fruit of knowledge through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God."
50,1,12,"I wish you to know, brethren, that my affairs have turned out rather to the furtherance of the good news,"
50,1,13,"so that my chains have become well known as for Christ to the whole Praetorian Guard and to all the rest,"
50,1,14,"and the most of the brethren in the Lord, made confident by my chains, are unusually brave in speaking the message fearlessly."
50,1,15,"Some indeed proclaim Christ because of envy and rivalry, some also because of good will."
50,1,16,"Some announce Christ from love, knowing that I am placed for the defense of the good news,"
50,1,17,"but others out of partisanship, thinking to add distress to my chains."
50,1,18,"What then? Still in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed and in that I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice."
50,1,19,"For I know that this will make for my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,"
50,1,20,"according to my earnest expectation and hope that I may be put to shame in nothing, but with all courage, as always, so now Christ may be honored in my body, whether by my life or by my death."
50,1,21,"For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain."
50,1,22,"If it is to be life in the flesh, that means fruitful work for me. I know not which to choose."
50,1,23,"I am under pressure both ways, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for it is far better,"
50,1,24,"yet that I should stay in the flesh is more needful on your account."
50,1,25,"And this I confidently know, that I shall stay and stay near you all for your advancement and joy of faith,"
50,1,26,"that your exultation in Christ Jesus may overflow on my account, because of my presence again with you."
50,1,27,"Only exercise your citizenship in a manner worthy of the good news of Christ, so that, whether I come and see you or in absence hear news of you, I may know that you are standing in one spirit, with one mind wrestling in the faith of the good news"
50,1,28,"and not frightened in anything by your adversaries, which for them is a sign of ruin, but for you of salvation, and that from God;"
50,1,29,"because it has been graciously allowed you not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for his sake,"
50,1,30,"and you have the same struggle that you saw in me and now hear of in me."
50,2,1,"IF there is any encouragement in Christ, any persuasive power in love, any fellowship in the Spirit, any sympathies and compassions,"
50,2,2,"fill up my joy by having the same love, being of the same mind, thinking the same thing,"
50,2,3,"doing nothing in a partisan or vainglorious way, but each modestly regarding the others as of more account than himself."
50,2,4,"Do not be each intent on his own interests, but also on the interests of others."
50,2,5,"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,"
50,2,6,"who, though he was in the form of God, did not think that equality with God was something to be grasped,"
50,2,7,"but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant and coming into the likeness of men,"
50,2,8,"and when found in the condition of a man he humbled himself by becoming obedient even to death \'97 death on the cross."
50,2,9,"Therefore, God has highly exalted him and has graciously given him the name which is above every name,"
50,2,10,"that at the name of Jesus every knee may bow, of beings in heaven and those on earth and those under the earth,"
50,2,11,"and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
50,2,12,"So then, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with reverence and awe."
50,2,13,"For it is God who is working in you both the willing and the doing because of his kindness."
50,2,14,"Do everything without murmurings or disputings"
50,2,15,"that you may be blameless and pure, children of God, spotless in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you shine as lights in the world,"
50,2,16,"holding forth the message of life, so that on the day of Christ I can boast that I did not run in vain or labor in vain."
50,2,17,"But if I am poured out as a libation on your sacrificial offering of faith, I rejoice and share the joy of you all."
50,2,18,"In the same way you must rejoice and share my joy."
50,2,19,"But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I may be cheered by knowing about you."
50,2,20,"For I have no one likeminded with him who will so sincerely care for your interests."
50,2,21,"For all pursue their own aims, not those of Christ Jesus."
50,2,22,"But you know how he has been tested and how like a child with a father he has served with me in spreading the good news."
50,2,23,"So I hope to send him at once when I see how my affairs are going."
50,2,24,"And I trust in the Lord that I myself shall come quickly."
50,2,25,"I think it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my needs,"
50,2,26,"since he longs for you all and is troubled because you have heard that he was sick."
50,2,27,"Indeed he was sick and near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not on him alone, but also on me, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow."
50,2,28,"I send him the more readily that you may see him and rejoice again and I be less sorrowful."
50,2,29,"Receive him in the Lord with all joy and hold such men in honor,"
50,2,30,"because for the work of Christ he was near to death, hazarding his life to complete the service you were not here to do for me."
50,3,1,"TO conclude, my brethren: rejoice in the Lord. To repeat to you the same things is not tiresome to me and it is safe for you."
50,3,2,"Beware of the dogs, beware of the bad workmen, beware of the excision."
50,3,3,"For we are the circumcision, we who worship in the Spirit of God and exult in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh,"
50,3,4,"though I have ground for confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has ground for confidence in the flesh, I have more \'97"
50,3,5,"circumcised the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, as to the Law a Pharisee,"
50,3,6,"as to zeal persecuting the church, as to the righteousness of the Law blameless."
50,3,7,"But the things that were gain to me, those I have counted loss for Christ."
50,3,8,"Yes, I count all to be loss because of the surpassing worth of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but refuse, that I may gain Christ"
50,3,9,"and be found in him, not having my own righteousness that was from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God and rests on faith,"
50,3,10,"that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming like him in death,"
50,3,11,"if possibly I may attain to the resurrection from the dead."
50,3,12,"Not that I have already obtained it or have already been made perfect, but I press on to lay hold of that for which I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus."
50,3,13,"Brethren, I do not consider myself yet to have laid hold of it. But one thing I do: forgetting what is behind and stretching forward to what is in front"
50,3,14,"I press toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus."
50,3,15,"Let us all who are full grown think in this way. If in anything you think differently, even that God will reveal to you,"
50,3,16,"but so far as we have attained let us walk in the same path."
50,3,17,"Unite in imitating me, brethren, and watch those who are living according to our example."
50,3,18,"For many are living as I used often to tell you and now say even weeping that they are enemies of the cross of Christ."
50,3,19,"Their end is ruin, their God is their stomach, their glory is in their shame, they think earthly thoughts."
50,3,20,"For the state of which we are citizens is in the heavens and from there we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ."
50,3,21,"He will transform the body we have in our low estate into the likeness of the body he has in glory by the power by which he can subject all things to himself."
50,4,1,"SO, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, beloved."
50,4,2,"I beg Euodia and I beg Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord."
50,4,3,"Yes, I ask you, true yokefellow, help them, since they struggled in spreading the good news along with me and Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life."
50,4,4,"Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I say rejoice."
50,4,5,"Let your fairness be known to all men. The Lord is near."
50,4,6,"Do not worry, but in everything by prayer and entreaty with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God."
50,4,7,"And the peace of God which passes all understanding will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus."
50,4,8,"To conclude, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is dignified, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovable, whatever is highly spoken of \'97 if there is any virtue or any praise \'97 think of that."
50,4,9,"What you learned and accepted and heard and saw in me \'97 practice that. And the God of peace will be with you."
50,4,10,"I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length your thoughtfulness for me had revived. You were thoughtful for me all along, but lacked opportunity."
50,4,11,"Not that I am speaking because of want; for I have learned how to be content in whatever circumstances I am."
50,4,12,"I know how to live humbly and I know how to enjoy abundance. In each and every situation I have been initiated into the secret both of being well fed and of going hungry, both of having abundance and of bearing want."
50,4,13,"I can do all things through him who gives me strength."
50,4,14,"Yet you did nobly in sharing with me in my distress."
50,4,15,"You Philippians know that at the beginning of the good news, when I came away from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only,"
50,4,16,"and that in Thessalonica you sent once, yes, twice, for my need."
50,4,17,"Not that I am seeking for the gift, but I am seeking for the fruit that increases to your credit."
50,4,18,"I have enough of everything and more than enough. I am fully supplied since receiving from Epaphroditus the things from you, a fragrant odor, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God."
50,4,19,"My God will supply every need of yours according to his wealth in glory in Christ Jesus."
50,4,20,"To God our Father be glory for the ages of the ages! Amen."
50,4,21,"Greet every holy one in Christ Jesus. The brethren with me send greetings to you."
50,4,22,"All the holy send greetings to you, especially those of Caesar's household."
50,4,23,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits!"
51,1,1,"PAUL, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,"
51,1,2,"to the holy and faithful brethren in Christ in Colossae: Grace be to you and peace from God our Father!"
51,1,3,"We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, in praying for you,"
51,1,4,"because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love that you have to all the holy"
51,1,5,"because of the hope laid up for us in heaven. Of this you have already heard in the true message of the good news"
51,1,6,"which has come to you. Just as in all the world it is bearing fruit and growing, so also it is among you since the day that you heard and learned of the grace of God in truth."
51,1,7,"So you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ in your behalf,"
51,1,8,"and who has told us of your love in the Spirit."
51,1,9,"For this reason we also, from the day we heard it, never cease praying for you and asking that you may have full knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual insight,"
51,1,10,"and that you may live lives worthy of the Lord and please him in every way. May you bear fruit in every good work and grow in the knowledge of God."
51,1,11,"May you be strengthened with all strength according to his glorious power, so as to have all patience and endurance."
51,1,12,"May you joyfully give thanks to the Father who has made you fit to share in the inheritance of the holy in light."
51,1,13,"He has saved us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son,"
51,1,14,"in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of our sins."
51,1,15,"He is the image of the invisible God, the first born of all creation;"
51,1,16,"for in him were created all things in heaven and on earth, both visible and invisible, whether thrones or lordships or archangels or powers \'97 all things have been created through him and for him,"
51,1,17,"and he is before all things and in him all things unite."
51,1,18,"And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that he may be first in all things,"
51,1,19,"because it pleased God to have all his fullness dwell in him"
51,1,20,"and to reconcile all things to himself through him, making peace through the blood of his cross \'97 all things, I say, whether on earth or in heaven."
51,1,21,"And you who were once alienated and enemies in your minds, living in wicked works, he has reconciled"
51,1,22,"by his body of flesh through death, to present you holy and spotless and blameless before him,"
51,1,23,"if you remain in the faith, firm and steadfast, never moving from the hope of the good news which you have heard and which has been proclaimed in all the creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a servant."
51,1,24,"Now I rejoice in what I suffer for your sake, and in my turn am filling up in my flesh what was lacking in the afflictions of Christ for the sake of his body, that is, the church."
51,1,25,"I became a servant of the church according to the commission from God given to me for you, to deliver fully God's message,"
51,1,26,"the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now made plain to his holy ones,"
51,1,27,"to whom God willed to make known what is the glorious wealth of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you the hope of glory."
51,1,28,"And we are announcing him, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom in order that we may present every man complete in Christ."
51,1,29,"For this also I labor, wrestling with the energy of him who works powerfully within me."
51,2,1,"FOR I wish you to know how I am wrestling for you and for those in Laodicea and for all who have not seen my face in the flesh,"
51,2,2,"that your hearts may be encouraged and that joined together in love you may reach all the wealth of the full assurance of insight into the knowledge of the mystery of God, which is Christ."
51,2,3,"In him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge lie hidden."
51,2,4,"I say this that no one may deceive you by plausible arguments."
51,2,5,"For even though I am absent in the flesh, yet in the spirit I am with you, rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ."
51,2,6,"Since, then, you have received Christ Jesus as Lord, live in him,"
51,2,7,"rooted and built up in him, growing strong in the faith as you have been taught, and overflowing with thanksgiving."
51,2,8,"Beware that no one carries you away captive by his philosophy and empty deceit according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary teachings of the world and not according to Christ."
51,2,9,"For in him dwells all the fullness of God in bodily form,"
51,2,10,"and you have been filled in him. He is the head of every archangel and authority."
51,2,11,"In him you were circumcised with a circumcision not done by hands, by laying aside your fleshly body in the circumcision of Christ."
51,2,12,"You were buried with him in baptism and raised again through faith in the inworking of God who raised him from the dead."
51,2,13,"You who were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh God has made alive with him, and has forgiven us all our sins."
51,2,14,"He erased the writing that was against us in the rules, the writing that was opposed to us. He has taken it out of the way by nailing it to his cross."
51,2,15,"He despoiled the archangels and authorities and fearlessly made an example of them when he triumphed over them on the cross."
51,2,16,"Let no one then judge you in the matter of food or drink or in regard to a festival or new moon or Sabbath."
51,2,17,"These were a shadow of coming things, but the body is Christ's."
51,2,18,"Let no one as umpire defraud you of your prize, if he delights in excessive humility and ceremonial worship of the angels, searching into his own visions, emptily puffed up by his fleshly mind"
51,2,19,"and not holding to the Head, from whom the whole body, supplied and held together by joints and bands, grows as God gives it growth."
51,2,20,"If you died with Christ to the elementary teachings of the world, why do you, as if still living in the world, have such rules as,"
51,2,21,"Do not touch, Do not taste, Do not handle"
51,2,22,"referring to things that perish when used?"
51,2,23,"These rules follow the commandments and teachings of men. They have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed ceremonial and excessive humility and severity to the body, but have no value against the indulgence of the flesh."
51,3,1,"IF then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God."
51,3,2,"Have your minds on the things above and not on the things on the earth."
51,3,3,"For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God."
51,3,4,"When Christ, our life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory."
51,3,5,"Treat the members of your earthly bodies as dead \'97 dead to unchastity, impurity, passion, evil desire, and avarice, which is idolatry."
51,3,6,"On account of these things comes the wrath of God."
51,3,7,"To them you also were once habituated when you lived in them."
51,3,8,"But now you also must put away all wrath, anger, malice, abusive language. Vile talk must not be in your mouths."
51,3,9,"Do not lie to one another. You have stripped off the old self with his practices"
51,3,10,"and have clothed yourselves with the new self, which is being renewed into knowledge in the image of its Creator."
51,3,11,"Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave or freeman, but Christ is all and in all."
51,3,12,"Put on, then, as the chosen of God, holy and beloved, sympathies, compassions, kindness, humility, gentleness, slowness to anger,"
51,3,13,"bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if any one has a grievance against any. Just as the Lord forgave you, so must you forgive."
51,3,14,"Above all these, clothe yourselves with love, which is the perfect bond of union."
51,3,15,"Let the peace of Christ be umpire in your hearts. For this you were called into one body. And be thankful."
51,3,16,"The message of Christ must dwell in you richly, as you teach in all wisdom and admonish one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and sing with grace in your hearts to God."
51,3,17,"And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him."
51,3,18,"Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord."
51,3,19,"Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh toward them."
51,3,20,"Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing in the Lord."
51,3,21,"Fathers, do not irritate your children, for they may lose heart."
51,3,22,"Slaves, obey in everything your masters in the flesh, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, because you reverence the Lord."
51,3,23,"Whatever you do, do it heartily as for the Lord and not for men,"
51,3,24,"for you know that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. You are slaves to the Lord Christ."
51,3,25,"He who does wrong will be repaid for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality."
51,4,1,"MASTERS, give to your slaves what is just and equal, for you know that you have a Master in heaven."
51,4,2,"Be earnest and constant in prayer. Be thankfully watchful in it."
51,4,3,"Pray along with us and for us that God may open for us a door for the message, so that I may tell the mystery of Christ for the sake of which I am in chains \'97"
51,4,4,"so that I may make it clear, as I ought."
51,4,5,"Behave wisely towards outsiders, buying up the opportunity."
51,4,6,"Let what you say be always with grace, seasoned with salt. Know how you should answer each one."
51,4,7,"Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful worker and fellow servant in the Lord, will tell you everything about me."
51,4,8,"I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know my situation and that he may encourage your hearts."
51,4,9,"And with him I am sending Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you all about affairs here."
51,4,10,"Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends his greetings, and so does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas"
51,4,11,"and so does Jesus who is called Justus. These alone of those who are circumcised are my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me."
51,4,12,"Epaphras, the servant of Christ Jesus, who is one of you, sends his greetings to you. He always wrestles in prayer on your behalf that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God."
51,4,13,"I bear witness to the burden that he carries for you and for those in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis."
51,4,14,"Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas send you their greetings."
51,4,15,"Give our greeting to the brethren in Laodicea and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house."
51,4,16,"When this letter has been read among you, have it read in the church of the Laodiceans, and you are to read the letter that will come from Laodicea."
51,4,17,"Say to Archippus, See to it that you fully perform the service which you have accepted in the Lord."
51,4,18,"The greeting of Paul, by my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you."
52,1,1,"PAUL and Silvanus and Timothy, to the Church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace."
52,1,2,"We thank God always for you all when we mention you in our prayers,"
52,1,3,"unceasingly remembering your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ before God our Father."
52,1,4,"We know, brethren beloved by God, that he has chosen you"
52,1,5,"and that our good news came to you not in word only but in power and in the Holy Spirit and in great assurance, just as you know we acted among you for your benefit."
52,1,6,"You became imitators of us and of the Lord, receiving the message in great affliction with joy which the Holy Spirit gave,"
52,1,7,"so that you became a pattern for all believers in Macedonia and in Achaia."
52,1,8,"For the message of the Lord sounded forth from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith toward God has gone abroad, so that there is no need for us to speak a word."
52,1,9,"For the people themselves are telling about us, what a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God"
52,1,10,"and to wait for his Son from heaven \'97 his Son Jesus whom he raised from the dead and who is saving us from the coming wrath."
52,2,1,"YOU yourselves know, brethren, what a reception we had from you, that it was not without result,"
52,2,2,"but after we had suffered and been roughly treated, as you know, in Philippi, we made bold in our God to speak to you the good news of God with great wrestling."
52,2,3,"For our appeal springs not from deception, nor from impure motives, nor from cunning,"
52,2,4,"but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak, not as if we were pleasing men, but God, who tests our hearts."
52,2,5,"Nor did we ever fall into flattering talk, as you know, nor use any pretext for self-enrichment \'97 God is witness \'97"
52,2,6,"nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or others, although we could have claimed the dignity of Christ's apostles."
52,2,7,"But we became gentle in the midst of you like a nursing mother cherishing her own children."
52,2,8,"Yearning over you so, we would gladly have imparted to you not only God's good news but our own lives as well, because you had become dear to us."
52,2,9,"For you remember, brethren, our toil and labor as we worked night and day so as not to burden any one of you while we proclaimed to you the good news of God."
52,2,10,"You are witnesses \'97 and God is witness \'97 how purely and justly and blamelessly we acted toward you who believe."
52,2,11,"You know that just like a father toward his own children we encouraged each one of you, and warned and conjured you"
52,2,12,"to live lives worthy of the God who is calling you into his own kingdom and glory."
52,2,13,"For this reason we unceasingly give thanks to God that when you received from us the report of the message of God you accepted it not as the message of men, but, as it truly is, the message of God, which also is doing its work in you who believe."
52,2,14,"For you became imitators, brethren, of the churches of God that are in Judaea in Christ Jesus, because you too suffered the same things from your fellow countrymen that they did from the Jews,"
52,2,15,"who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out and do not please God and are enemies to all men,"
52,2,16,"trying to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. All this goes always to fill up the measure of their sins. But God's fiercest wrath has overtaken them."
52,2,17,"But we, brethren, when bereft of you for a little while, out of sight not out of mind, endeavored more earnestly to see your faces, with great longing."
52,2,18,"For that reason we determined to come to you, yes, I, Paul, more than once: but Satan hindered us."
52,2,19,"For what is our hope or joy or crown to boast of before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you?"
52,2,20,"You are our glory and joy."
52,3,1,"SO when we could no longer endure the anxiety, we chose to be left at Athens alone"
52,3,2,"and sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in the good news of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,"
52,3,3,"that no one might be disturbed in these trials. For you yourselves know that we are destined to this."
52,3,4,"For when we were with you we told you in advance, We shall soon have trouble. And so it came to pass, as you know."
52,3,5,"Therefore, when I could no longer endure the anxiety, I sent to know about your faith for fear that the tempter had tempted you and our labor had gone for nothing."
52,3,6,"But now that Timothy has come to us from you and has brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always keep us well in mind and long to see us, just as we long to see you,"
52,3,7,"we have been cheered, brethren, in regard to you, in all our straits and distresses by your faith."
52,3,8,"Now we are living, since you are standing firm in the Lord."
52,3,9,"For how can we be grateful enough to God for you in view of all the joy we have because of you,"
52,3,10,"while we pray beyond measure night and day that we may see your faces and make good whatever lacks there may be in your faith?"
52,3,11,"May our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus Christ open the way for us to come to you."
52,3,12,"The Lord make you to abound and overflow in love toward one another and toward all men, just as we do toward you,"
52,3,13,"that your hearts may be made firm and you may be blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones."
52,4,1,"TO conclude, brethren, we beg of you and urge you in the Lord Jesus that, as you learned from us how you ought to live to please God, and are living, you will excel still more."
52,4,2,"For you know what directions we have given you through the Lord Jesus."
52,4,3,"For this is the will of God: to have you become holy and have you shun unchastity;"
52,4,4,"to have each of you know how to take a wife for himself in holiness and honor,"
52,4,5,"not in the passion of lust, as the Gentiles do who know not God;"
52,4,6,"to have no one trespass or take advantage of his brother in this matter; for the Lord is the punisher of all such, as we have already told you and solemnly warned you."
52,4,7,"God has not called us to live in impurity, but in holiness."
52,4,8,"Therefore he who disregards this disregards not man, but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you."
52,4,9,"Regarding brotherly love you have no need for me to write to you. For you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another,"
52,4,10,"and you do the same to all the brethren in the whole of Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, to excel still further"
52,4,11,"and to be ambitious to lead a quiet life and to mind each his own business and to work with your hands, as we instructed you."
52,4,12,"Thus you will live becomingly in the sight of outsiders and will have need of nothing."
52,4,13,"We do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, regarding those who are sleeping, that you may not sorrow as the rest of men who have no hope."
52,4,14,"For since, as we believe, Jesus died and rose, so too God will through Jesus bring with him those who have fallen asleep."
52,4,15,"This we tell you by the word of the Lord: We, the living, who have been left until the coming of the Lord, will not have the start of those who have fallen asleep."
52,4,16,"For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel and with God's trumpet-call, and first the dead in Christ will rise."
52,4,17,"Then we, the living, who are left, will be caught up along with them into the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall forever be with the Lord."
52,4,18,"So encourage one another with these words."
52,5,1,"BUT regarding times and dates, brethren, you do not need to have me write to you."
52,5,2,"For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night."
52,5,3,"When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction is upon them, like the pangs upon a woman with child, and they will not escape."
52,5,4,"But you, brethren, are not in darkness so that the day can take you like a thief."
52,5,5,"You are all sons of light and sons of day. We do not belong to night or to darkness."
52,5,6,"Then let us not be sleeping like the rest of men, but let us watch and be sober."
52,5,7,"For those who sleep sleep in the night and those who drink drink in the night."
52,5,8,"But let us who are of the day be sober. Let us put on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation."
52,5,9,"For God has not destined us to wrath, but to the winning of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
52,5,10,"who died for us that whether we are waking or sleeping we may live in company with him."
52,5,11,"Therefore encourage one another and build up one another, as indeed you are doing."
52,5,12,"We beg you, brethren, to regard those who are laboring among you and who preside over you in the Lord and give you counsel,"
52,5,13,"and to esteem them very highly in love on account of their work. Be at peace among yourselves."
52,5,14,"We urge you, brethren, to warn the disorderly, encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, be patient with all."
52,5,15,"Take care that no one repays evil with evil, but always seek eagerly what is good in dealing with one another and with every one."
52,5,16,"Always be joyful."
52,5,17,"Pray without ceasing."
52,5,18,"In everything give thanks, for this is God's will in Christ for you."
52,5,19,"Do not quench the Spirit."
52,5,20,"Do not despise prophecies."
52,5,21,"Test all things; hold fast the good."
52,5,22,"Avoid every kind of evil."
52,5,23,"May the God of peace himself make you completely holy, and may your spirits and souls and bodies be kept faultless and blameless for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
52,5,24,"He is faithful who calls you and he will do it."
52,5,25,"Brethren, pray for us."
52,5,26,"Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss."
52,5,27,"I solemnly charge you in the Lord's name to have this letter read to all the brethren."
52,5,28,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."
53,1,1,"PAUL and Silvanus and Timothy to the Church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
53,1,2,"Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,1,3,"We ought always to thank God for you, brethren, as is fitting, since your faith is growing greatly and the love of each and all of you toward one another is increasing,"
53,1,4,"so that we ourselves glory in you among the churches of God because of your endurance and faith in all of your persecutions and in the distresses you are bearing."
53,1,5,"This is a proof of God's righteous judgment. It is to make you worthy of God's kingdom, on behalf of which you are suffering,"
53,1,6,"since it is just on God's part to repay with trouble those who are troubling you,"
53,1,7,"and to repay to you, who are being troubled, rest with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels."
53,1,8,"With flaming fire he will inflict vengeance on those who do not know God and do not obey the good news of our Lord Jesus."
53,1,9,"They will suffer the penalty of eternal destruction and be sent away from the face of the Lord and from his glorious power,"
53,1,10,"when he comes to be glorified among his holy ones and to be wondered at on that day among all believers \'97 for our testimony to you was believed."
53,1,11,"To this end we are always praying for you that our God will make you worthy of the call, and will by his power bring to completion every one of your kind purposes and works of faith,"
53,1,12,"that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,1,"WITH regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to meet him, I beg you, brethren,"
53,2,2,"not to be quickly unsettled in mind nor excited by either a revelation or by a message or a letter supposed to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is close at hand."
53,2,3,"Let no one lead you astray in any way, because it will not come until the Apostasy has first come and the Man of Lawlessness has been revealed \'97 the Son of Perdition,"
53,2,4,"who opposes and exalts himself above everything called God and every object of worship, so that he enters the Temple of God and seats himself there, declaring that he himself is God."
53,2,5,"Do you not remember that while I was still with you I used to tell you this?"
53,2,6,"And now you know what is restraining him until he is revealed at his appointed time."
53,2,7,"For the mystery of lawlessness is already working, only there is just now one who is restraining it until he passes out of the way."
53,2,8,"And then the Lawless One will be revealed. But the Lord Jesus will sweep him away with the breath of his mouth and will make him powerless by the splendor of his coming."
53,2,9,"For his coming will be when Satan is active in every sort of power and in false signs and wonders"
53,2,10,"and in every kind of wicked deception of those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth so that they might be saved."
53,2,11,"For this reason God sends to them a deceptive influence so that they believe a lie,"
53,2,12,"that all who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness may be condemned."
53,2,13,"We ought always to thank God for you, brethren, beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through the Spirit's making you holy and your own faith in the truth."
53,2,14,"To this he called you through the good news that we brought, so that you may share the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,15,"Now then, brethren, stand firm and hold fast the teachings that you have been taught whether by our words or by our letter."
53,2,16,"May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal encouragement and good hope through grace,"
53,2,17,"encourage your hearts and make you strong in every good word and work."
53,3,1,"IN conclusion, brethren, pray for us, that the Lord's message may run and be glorified, as among you,"
53,3,2,"and that we may be saved from the unreasonable and wicked men, for faith does not belong to all."
53,3,3,"But the Lord is faithful and he will strengthen you and guard you from evil."
53,3,4,"We are persuaded in the Lord in regard to you that you are doing and will do what we direct."
53,3,5,"The Lord guide your hearts in the love of God and the patience of Christ."
53,3,6,"We charge you, brethren, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to stand aloof from every brother who is living in a disorderly way and not according to the teaching that you received from us."
53,3,7,"For you yourselves know that you should imitate us, for we were not disorderly when among you,"
53,3,8,"nor did we eat bread with any one without paying, but with labor and toil night and day we worked in order not to burden any one of you."
53,3,9,"Not that we have not the authority, but in order to give you ourselves as an example for you to imitate."
53,3,10,"For when we were with you we gave you this command, If any one will not work, neither is he to eat."
53,3,11,"For we hear that some among you are leading disorderly lives, busy about nothing and yet busybodies."
53,3,12,"Such we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and eat their own bread."
53,3,13,"But you, brethren, must not become discouraged in doing well."
53,3,14,"If any one does not obey our words in this letter, mark that man and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed."
53,3,15,"Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother."
53,3,16,"The Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all."
53,3,17,"The greeting of Paul by my own hand, which is the sign in every letter. This is my handwriting."
53,3,18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you."
54,1,1,"PAUL, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the appointment of God, our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope,"
54,1,2,"to Timothy my true child in faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
54,1,3,"As I begged you to stay in Ephesus when I was leaving for Macedonia, that you might charge some not to teach new and strange doctrines"
54,1,4,"nor give attention to myths and endless genealogies, which promote disputes rather than God's plan in the faith, so I beg you now."
54,1,5,"The aim of the commandment is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith."
54,1,6,"Some missing these have turned aside to empty talk,"
54,1,7,"wishing to be teachers of the Law, but not understanding either what they are saying or what the things are that they are so positive about."
54,1,8,"We know that the Law is excellent, if any one uses it lawfully."
54,1,9,"But we know this: that law is not laid down for a righteous man, but for the lawless and the insubordinate, the ungodly and sinners, the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"
54,1,10,"for the unchaste, for those who practice unnatural vices, for slave-dealers, liars, perjurers, and for whatever else is contrary to wholesome teaching"
54,1,11,"such as accords with the glorious good news of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted."
54,1,12,"I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has given me strength, because he thought me faithful and put me into his service,"
54,1,13,"though before that I spoke profanely and was a persecutor and insolent in outrages. But I received mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief."
54,1,14,"And the grace of our Lord overflowed in me with faith and love in Christ Jesus."
54,1,15,"The saying is trust-worthy and deserving of full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost."
54,1,16,"But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might show all of his long-suffering for an example for those who are to believe in him and gain life eternal."
54,1,17,"To the King of the ages, the immortal, invisible, only God, be honor and glory for the ages of the ages! Amen."
54,1,18,"This command I lay down for you, my child Timothy, in accordance with the prophecies that came in advance regarding you, in order that armed with them you may wage the noble war,"
54,1,19,"holding to faith and a good conscience, which some have cast aside and thus made shipwreck of their faith."
54,1,20,"Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, that they may learn not to speak profanely."
54,2,1,"I BEG, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, supplications, and thanksgivings be made in behalf of all men,"
54,2,2,"in behalf of kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all piety and sobriety."
54,2,3,"This is excellent and pleasing in the sight of God, our Savior,"
54,2,4,"who wishes all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth."
54,2,5,"For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus,"
54,2,6,"who gave himself as a ransom for all, a fact to be witnessed to at the fitting time."
54,2,7,"To this I was appointed a herald and an apostle \'97 I am telling the truth, I am not lying \'97 a teacher of Gentiles in faith and truth."
54,2,8,"I wish, then, that the men offer prayer in every place, lifting up holy hands without wrath or debate."
54,2,9,"Also that the women adorn themselves in becoming dress modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothes,"
54,2,10,"but \'97 as is becoming for women professing piety \'97 with good deeds."
54,2,11,"A woman is to learn in all subjection."
54,2,12,"I do not permit a woman to teach or to usurp authority over a man, but she must remain silent."
54,2,13,"Adam was first formed, then Eve."
54,2,14,"And Adam was not deceived; the woman was deceived and fell into sin."
54,2,15,"But they will be saved through child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control."
54,3,1,"THE saying is trustworthy: If any one aspires to the office of a bishop, he desires a noble work."
54,3,2,"A bishop, then, should be above reproach, true to one woman, temperate, self-controlled, dignified, hospitable, with a gift for teaching,"
54,3,3,"not given to wine or to blows, but fair-minded, averse to strife, not a lover of money,"
54,3,4,"presiding well over his own house, with children obedient and respectful."
54,3,5,"But if any one does not know how to preside over his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?"
54,3,6,"He must not be a new convert, for fear he may be blinded by pride and fall into the condemnation of the Devil."
54,3,7,"He must have a good reputation with outsiders so as not to fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil."
54,3,8,"Deacons, in the same way, must be dignified, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not eager for base gain,"
54,3,9,"holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience."
54,3,10,"They must first be tested, and then let them fill the office of deacon if there is nothing against them."
54,3,11,"Women, in the same way, must be dignified, not slanderers, temperate, trustworthy in everything."
54,3,12,"Deacons must be men true to one woman, presiding well over their children and their own houses."
54,3,13,"Those who have filled the office of deacon well win for themselves a high standing and great boldness in the faith in Christ Jesus."
54,3,14,"I am writing these things to you, although I hope to come to you soon,"
54,3,15,"but so that if I am delayed you may know how people should conduct themselves in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth."
54,3,16,"Confessedly great is the mystery of godliness: Who was manifested in flesh, declared righteous in spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up in glory."
54,4,1,"THE Spirit says distinctly that in later times some will desert from the faith, giving attention to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons,"
54,4,2,"through the hypocrisy of men who teach falsely, branded in their own consciences,"
54,4,3,"forbidding marriage, and insisting on abstinence from certain kinds of food which God made to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who are faithful and know the truth."
54,4,4,"For everything made by God is excellent and nothing is to be rejected if taken with thanksgiving."
54,4,5,"For it is made holy through God's message and through prayer."
54,4,6,"In teaching this to the brethren you will be a noble servant of Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of the faith and of the excellent teaching which you have followed."
54,4,7,"But avoid profane and old-womanish myths. Exercise yourself in godliness."
54,4,8,"Bodily exercise is useful to a small degree, but godliness is useful for everything. It has the promise of the present life and of the life that is to come."
54,4,9,"This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance."
54,4,10,"For to this end we are laboring and wrestling, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers."
54,4,11,"Command and teach these things."
54,4,12,"Let no one look down on you because you are young, but be an example to believers in speech, in the life you lead, in love, in faith, in purity."
54,4,13,"Until I come give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching."
54,4,14,"Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership."
54,4,15,"Be careful about these things, be fully occupied with them, that your progress may be plain to all."
54,4,16,"Be thoughtful about yourself and your teaching. Persevere in this; for in doing so you will save yourself and those who hear you."
54,5,1,"Do not rebuke an older man, but entreat him as a father, the younger men as brothers,"
54,5,2,"the older women as mothers and the younger women as sisters, in all purity."
54,5,3,"Honor widows if they are really widows."
54,5,4,"If any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to act piously toward their own family and to repay what they owe to their parents and grandparents. For this is pleasing in the sight of God."
54,5,5,"A real widow who is left alone has set her hope on God and devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day."
54,5,6,"But the pleasure-loving widow, though living, is already dead."
54,5,7,"Give these commands that they may be free from reproach."
54,5,8,"If any one does not provide for his own, and especially those of his own household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
54,5,9,"A widow is to be put on the list if she has reached the age of not less than sixty years, if she has been true to one husband,"
54,5,10,"has a reputation for good deeds, has brought up children, has entertained strangers, has washed the feet of the holy, has ministered to people in distress, has been active in every good work."
54,5,11,"But younger widows refuse, for when wanton desires lead them away from Christ they wish to marry"
54,5,12,"and thus they incur condemnation for breaking their first promise."
54,5,13,"At the same time they learn to be idle, going around from house to house, and not only idle, but gossips, and busybodies, saying what they should not."
54,5,14,"I would, therefore, have the younger widows marry, bear children, keep house, give no occasion to our enemies for slander."
54,5,15,"For already some have turned aside after Satan."
54,5,16,"If any woman who is a believer has widows, she must provide for them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may provide for those who are really widows."
54,5,17,"The elders who preside well should be thought worthy of double salary, especially those who labor in speaking and teaching."
54,5,18,"For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox while he is treading out the grain, and"
54,5,19,"Against an elder do not receive an accusation unless on the testimony of two or three witnesses."
54,5,20,"Those who are going on in sin rebuke before all, that the rest may fear."
54,5,21,"I charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels to observe these directions without prejudice, doing nothing through partiality."
54,5,22,"Do not lay hands of ordination upon any one hastily. Have no share in the sins of other men. Keep yourself pure."
54,5,23,"Do not keep on being a water-drinker, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and because of your frequent ailments."
54,5,24,"Some men's sins are conspicuous and go on before to condemnation, but the sins of some men follow after them."
54,5,25,"Just so noble deeds are conspicuous and those that are otherwise cannot be hid."
54,6,1,"ALL who are slaves under the yoke must regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be profanely slandered."
54,6,2,"Those who have believing masters must not despise them because they are brothers, but rather work as slaves for them because those who are benefited by their good work are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these things."
54,6,3,"If any one teaches otherwise and does not agree to wholesome words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to religious teaching,"
54,6,4,"he is conceited, knowing nothing, but morbidly fond of disputes and controversies from which come envy, strife, abusive language, wicked suspicions,"
54,6,5,"and wranglings of men of depraved minds who are destitute of the truth. They think of religion as a source of gain."
54,6,6,"Religion with contentment is a great source of gain."
54,6,7,"For we brought nothing into the world and we cannot carry anything out."
54,6,8,"If we have food and clothing we will be content with these."
54,6,9,"But those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and injurious passions which plunge men into destruction and ruin."
54,6,10,"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some men grasping for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pangs."
54,6,11,"But you, O man of God, must shun this. Pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, gentleness."
54,6,12,"Play the grand hard game of the faith. Lay hold on life eternal, to which you have been called and have made the noble confession before many witnesses."
54,6,13,"I charge you in the presence of God who gives life to all, and Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate made the noble confession,"
54,6,14,"to keep the commandment stainless and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
54,6,15,"which in due time he will show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,"
54,6,16,"who alone has immortality, who dwells in light unapproachable, whom no man has seen or can see. To him be honor and power eternal! Amen."
54,6,17,"Command those who are rich in this world not to be haughty nor to fix their hope on uncertain wealth, but on God who provides all things richly for our enjoyment."
54,6,18,"They must do good work, be rich in noble deeds, be generous, ready to share,"
54,6,19,"treasuring up for themselves a good fund for the future, that they may lay hold on the life that is real."
54,6,20,"O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, turning away from profane and empty talk and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge."
54,6,21,"Some while professing it have gone astray as regards the faith. Grace be with you all."
55,1,1,"PAUL, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,"
55,1,2,"to Timothy my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord."
55,1,3,"I thank God whom, I serve, following in the steps of my forefathers, with a pure conscience, while I constantly mention you in my prayers night and day,"
55,1,4,"remembering your tears and longing to see you, that I may be filled with joy."
55,1,5,"I remember the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and then in your mother Eunice, and I am confident that it lives in you also."
55,1,6,"For this reason let me remind you to kindle anew the gift of God that is in you by the laying on of my hands."
55,1,7,"For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and self-control."
55,1,8,"Do not be ashamed to testify for our Lord or for me his prisoner, but join in suffering hardships for the good news as God gives power."
55,1,9,"It is he who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our deeds but according to his own purpose and grace, given to us in Christ Jesus ages ago"
55,1,10,"but now manifested by the appearance of our Savior Christ Jesus, who has defeated death and brought to light life and immortality by the good news."
55,1,11,"For this I was made a herald and an apostle and a teacher,"
55,1,12,"and for this reason I am suffering these things. But I am not ashamed, for I know in whom I have put my faith, and am confident that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day."
55,1,13,"Hold to the example of wholesome words which you heard from me in faith and love in Christ Jesus."
55,1,14,"Guard through the Holy Spirit which dwells in us the precious trust committed to you."
55,1,15,"You know that all of those in Asia have deserted me. Among them are Phygelus and Hermogenes."
55,1,16,"The Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, for he often cheered me and was not ashamed of my chain;"
55,1,17,"but when he came to Rome he looked me up eagerly and found me."
55,1,18,"The Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day! And in how many ways he served me in Ephesus you know better still."
55,2,1,"YOU, therefore, my child, must be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus,"
55,2,2,"and the things you heard from me, which came through many witnesses, you must commit to trustworthy men who will be able to teach others also."
55,2,3,"Take your share of hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus."
55,2,4,"No one while serving as a soldier entangles himself in the affairs of life, for the soldier must please him who enlisted him."
55,2,5,"And if any one enters an athletic contest, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules."
55,2,6,"The farmer who does the labor ought first to have his share of the fruits."
55,2,7,"Think over what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight in all things."
55,2,8,"Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David, as my good news teaches."
55,2,9,"In telling it I am suffering hardships even to chains, as if I were an evildoer, but God's message is not chained."
55,2,10,"For this reason I am enduring all for the sake of the chosen, that they may gain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
55,2,11,"Trustworthy is the saying, For if we have died with him we shall also live with him;"
55,2,12,"if we endure we shall also be kings with him; if we disown him, he will disown us;"
55,2,13,"if we are faithless, he remains faithful; for he cannot disown himself."
55,2,14,"Remind them of these things, charging them before God not to engage in controversy to no profit, but to the ruin of the hearers."
55,2,15,"Be earnest in presenting yourself to God as a tested man, a workman who has no cause to be ashamed, rightly handling the message of truth."
55,2,16,"But shun profane and empty talk. It will grow into greater impiety,"
55,2,17,"and its teachings will spread like a gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort."
55,2,18,"They have gone astray as to the truth, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they are overthrowing the faith of some."
55,2,19,"However, God's solid foundation stands, with this inscription, The Lord knows his own, and, Let every one who names the Lord's name turn from wickedness."
55,2,20,"In a great house there are not only utensils of gold and silver, but also of wood and earthenware, and some are for honorable and others for dishonorable uses."
55,2,21,"If any one keeps himself pure from these errors, he will be ready for honorable use, holy, fit for the master's service, prepared for every good work."
55,2,22,"But flee the passions of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, in the company of those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
55,2,23,"Avoid foolish disputes of the uneducated, knowing that they give rise to quarrels,"
55,2,24,"and the servant of the Lord must not quarrel, but be courteous to all, skillful in teaching, forbearing,"
55,2,25,"instructing opponents with gentleness, for God may give them a change of heart which will lead them to knowledge of the truth,"
55,2,26,"and they may return to soberness and escape the snare of the Devil when captured by the Lord's servant to do the Lord's will."
55,3,1,"I WOULD have you know this, that in the last days trying times will come;"
55,3,2,"for people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters, haughty, abusive, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, profane,"
55,3,3,"without family affection, relentless, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, haters of good,"
55,3,4,"treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God."
55,3,5,"They will have a form of religion, but will cast off its power. Avoid such people."
55,3,6,"For of this class are those who make their way into houses and take captive weak women loaded with sins, led by varying passions,"
55,3,7,"always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."
55,3,8,"Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men oppose the truth, depraved in mind, proved to be worthless as regards the faith."
55,3,9,"But they will go no further, for their folly will be manifest to all as that of Jannes and Jambres became."
55,3,10,"But you have kept track of my teaching, my course of life, my purpose, my faith, my slowness to anger, my love, my patience,"
55,3,11,"my persecutions, my sufferings \'97 what happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, what persecutions I underwent. But the Lord delivered me out of all of them."
55,3,12,"And all who are determined to live religiously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."
55,3,13,"Wicked men and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived."
55,3,14,"But you must stand by what you learned and were persuaded of, knowing from whom you learned it"
55,3,15,"and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which can give you wisdom to gain salvation through faith in Christ Jesus."
55,3,16,"All Scripture is divinely inspired and is useful for teaching, for proof, for correction of error, for education in righteousness,"
55,3,17,"that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work."
55,4,1,"I CHARGE you before God and Christ Jesus, who will soon judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:"
55,4,2,"proclaim the message, be at it in season and out of season, convince, rebuke, encourage, with all patience in teaching."
55,4,3,"For there will be a time when they will not endure wholesome teaching, but following their own fancies and wishing to have their ears tickled, they will get a crowd of teachers."
55,4,4,"They will turn their ears away from the truth and give attention to myths."
55,4,5,"But you must be calm in all circumstances, suffer hardships, do the work of a bringer of the good news, carry out fully all the duties of your office."
55,4,6,"For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time of my departure is near."
55,4,7,"I have played the grand hard game, I have finished my race, I have kept the faith."
55,4,8,"Now the crown of righteousness is awaiting me. The Lord the righteous judge will give it to me on that day, and not only to me but to all those who have loved his appearing."
55,4,9,"Make haste to come to me quickly."
55,4,10,"For Demas deserted me because he loved the present world and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia."
55,4,11,"Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in service."
55,4,12,"I sent Tychicus to Ephesus."
55,4,13,"When you come, bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, and particularly the parchments."
55,4,14,"Alexander the coppersmith showed much ill will toward me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds."
55,4,15,"Be on your guard against him, for he strongly opposed our teachings."
55,4,16,"At my first defense no one came to my help; all deserted me. May it not be laid up against them!"
55,4,17,"But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me so that through me the proclamation might be fully published and all the Gentiles might hear it, and I was saved from the mouth of the lion."
55,4,18,"The Lord will rescue me from every wicked attack and will keep me safe for his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for the ages of the ages! Amen."
55,4,19,"Give my greetings to Prises and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus."
55,4,20,"Erastus stayed at Corinth. Trophimus I left at Miletus, sick."
55,4,21,"Try to come before winter. Eubulus and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren send their greetings to you."
55,4,22,"The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all."
56,1,1,"PAUL, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to promote the faith of God's chosen and their knowledge of the truths of religion,"
56,1,2,"in hope of life eternal, which the God who never lies promised ages ago"
56,1,3,"but in due time made known as his message through the proclamation with which I was entrusted by the commission of God our Savior,"
56,1,4,"to Titus my true child in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus, our Savior."
56,1,5,"For this reason I left you in Crete: to arrange the things that are lacking and appoint elders in every city as I directed you,"
56,1,6,"wherever there is a man of irreproachable character, true to one woman, with believing children who are not charged with dissolute conduct and not unruly."
56,1,7,"For a bishop, as God's steward, must be above reproach, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not given to blows, not eager for base gain,"
56,1,8,"but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, just, holy, temperate,"
56,1,9,"holding to the trustworthy message which is according to the teaching, so that he may be able also to encourage others by wholesome teaching and to refute opposers."
56,1,10,"For there are many insubordinate persons, foolish talkers and deceivers, especially those who are of the circumcision,"
56,1,11,"who ought to be silenced, for they are upsetting whole house-holds, teaching what they should not, merely for the sake of base gain."
56,1,12,"One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, base brutes, lazy gluttons."
56,1,13,"This testimony is true. For this reason rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,"
56,1,14,"not giving attention to Jewish myths and rules laid down by men who are turning away from the truth."
56,1,15,"To the pure all things are pure; but to the polluted and unbelieving nothing is pure. Even their minds and consciences are polluted."
56,1,16,"They profess to know God, but by their deeds they disown him. They are detestable, disobedient, and worthless for any good work."
56,2,1,"YOU must speak to them of the matters which should have a place in wholesome teaching."
56,2,2,"Tell the older men to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, in patience."
56,2,3,"Tell the older women, in the same way, to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is noble,"
56,2,4,"that they may train the young women to be loving wives and loving mothers,"
56,2,5,"self-controlled, pure, home-workers, kind, submissive to their own husbands, that God's message may not be slandered."
56,2,6,"Urge the younger men, in the same way, to practice self-control in everything."
56,2,7,"Make yourself an example of good works, sincerity in teaching, dignified behavior"
56,2,8,"and wholesome talk that is above censure, that our opponents may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say about us."
56,2,9,"Tell slaves to be submissive to their own masters in all things and to try to please them, not answering back,"
56,2,10,"not pilfering, but showing all kindly fidelity, so as to make the teaching about God our Savior seem beautiful in all respects."
56,2,11,"For the grace of God has appeared bringing salvation to all men,"
56,2,12,"teaching us to renounce all irreligion and worldly passions and to live soberly, justly and piously in this present world,"
56,2,13,"waiting for the blessed hope, the glorious appearing of the great God and of our Savior Christ Jesus,"
56,2,14,"who gave himself for us to redeem us from all sin and purify us as his own people earnest in honorable work."
56,2,15,"Tell them these things, urge, convince with all authority; let no one slight you."
56,3,1,"REMIND them to be submissive to ruling authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,"
56,3,2,"to speak abusively to no one, to be peaceable, to be fair, showing all gentleness toward all men."
56,3,3,"For we ourselves were once thoughtless, disobedient, astray, enslaved to passions and various pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another."
56,3,4,"But when the kindness of our Savior, God, and his love to men appeared,"
56,3,5,"not because of works that we had done in righteousness, but out of his own mercy he saved us through the bath of the new birth and the renewing of the Holy Spirit"
56,3,6,"which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,"
56,3,7,"that we might be declared righteous by his grace and become heirs with the hope of life eternal."
56,3,8,"That is a trustworthy saying. I wish you to insist on these things so that those who have put their faith in God may give earnest attention to honorable work. These things are honorable and also useful to men."
56,3,9,"But avoid foolish disputes and genealogies and strife and quarrels about the Law; for they are unprofitable and futile."
56,3,10,"If a man is factious, after one or two warnings, have nothing more to do with him,"
56,3,11,"knowing that such a one is perverted and goes on sinning though self-condemned."
56,3,12,"When I send Artemas to you or Tychicus, try to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to pass the winter there."
56,3,13,"Do your best in helping Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos forward on their journey so that they may lack nothing."
56,3,14,"Our people too must learn to give attention to honorable work, so as to be able to meet pressing needs, that they may not be fruitless."
56,3,15,"All who are with me send you their greetings. Give our greetings to those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you."
57,1,1,"PAUL, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,"
57,1,2,"and to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the Church that meets at your house:"
57,1,3,"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
57,1,4,"I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers,"
57,1,5,"for I hear of the love and the loyalty that you have to the Lord Jesus Christ and to all the holy."
57,1,6,"I pray that your fellowship in the faith may become effective in the knowledge of all the good there is in us in our relation to Christ."
57,1,7,"For I have had great joy and encouragement in your love, because the hearts of the holy have been refreshed by you, brother."
57,1,8,"Therefore, though I might have great boldness in Christ to command you what is fitting,"
57,1,9,"I beg you rather for love's sake, as Paul the old man and now the prisoner of Christ Jesus \'97"
57,1,10,"I beg you in behalf of my child Onesimus, born to me in my chains,"
57,1,11,"who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me."
57,1,12,"I am sending him back to you, though he is my very heart."
57,1,13,"I should like to have him for my own, to serve me in my chains for the good news, as your representative,"
57,1,14,"but without your consent I am unwilling to do anything, so that your goodness may not be of necessity but of free will."
57,1,15,"Perhaps it was for this that he was separated from you for a time, that you might have him back for ever,"
57,1,16,"no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord."
57,1,17,"If then you hold me for a partner, receive him as you would me."
57,1,18,"If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account."
57,1,19,"I, Paul, write it with my own hand. I will pay it \'97 not to mention to you that you owe me your own self besides."
57,1,20,"Yes, brother, let me have this help from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ."
57,1,21,"I am writing to you confident of your obedience and knowing that you will do more than I say."
57,1,22,"At the same time I want you to prepare a lodging for me, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given back to you."
57,1,23,"Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus,"
57,1,24,"and Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers, send you their greetings."
57,1,25,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits."
58,1,1,"MANY times and in many ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets;"
58,1,2,"but at the end of these days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things and through whom he made the world,"
58,1,3,"who is the reflection of his glory and the expression of his nature and sustains all things by his word of power, and who, when he had made purification from sins, took his seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high,"
58,1,4,"having become as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited surpasses theirs."
58,1,5,"For to which of the angels did he ever say, Thou art my son; I have to-day become thy Father? and again, I will be to him a Father and he shall be to me a Son?"
58,1,6,"And again when he brings his first-born into the world of men he says, And let all the angels of God bow down to him."
58,1,7,"Referring to the angels he says, He makes his angels winds, his servants a flame of fire."
58,1,8,"But regarding the Son he says, Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever. Thy royal scepter is a scepter of justice."
58,1,9,"Thou lovest righteousness and hatest lawlessness, therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness beyond thy companions."
58,1,10,"And, Thou, in the beginning, O Lord, didst found the earth, and the heavens are works of thy hands."
58,1,11,"They will perish, but thou wilt endure. They all will grow old like a garment"
58,1,12,"and like a mantle thou wilt roll them up. But thou art the same and thy years will never end."
58,1,13,"To which of the angels did he ever say, Sit at my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool?"
58,1,14,"Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth for service in behalf of those who are to inherit salvation?"
58,2,1,"FOR this reason we should give special attention to the things that we have heard, so as not to drift away from them."
58,2,2,"For if the message spoken through angels was sure and every violation and disobedience received merited punishment,"
58,2,3,"how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at the beginning was spoken by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him,"
58,2,4,"while God added his testimony by signs and wonders and many kinds of miracles and impartation of the Holy Spirit according to his will?"
58,2,5,"For he has not subjected to angels the coming world of which we speak."
58,2,6,"But somewhere one says, What is man that thou rememberest him? Or the son of man that thou carest for him?"
58,2,7,"Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels. With glory and honor thou hast crowned him."
58,2,8,"All things thou hast put under his feet. When he put all things under him he left nothing that was not put under him. We do not yet see all things put under him,"
58,2,9,"but we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death that by the grace of God he might taste of death for every man, now crowned with glory and honor."
58,2,10,"For it was fitting that he through whom are all things and for whom are all things, when leading many sons to glory, should make the great Leader of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
58,2,11,"For he who makes holy and they who are made holy are all of one. For this cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,"
58,2,12,"saying, I will tell thy name to my brothers. In the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to thee,"
58,2,13,"and again, I will trust in him, and again, Here am I and the children whom God has given me."
58,2,14,"Since then the children share in blood and flesh, he himself in the same way shared in them, in order that through death he might defeat him who had the power of death, that is, the Devil,"
58,2,15,"and set free all those who through fear of death were all their lives doomed to slavery."
58,2,16,"For he does not come to the help of angels, but he comes to the help of the descendants of Abraham."
58,2,17,"And for that reason he had to be made like his brethren in everything, so as to be a compassionate and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people."
58,2,18,"For since he himself has suffered when tempted he is able to help those who are tempted."
58,3,1,"THEREFORE, holy brethren, sharers in a heavenly call, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus,"
58,3,2,"who was faithful to him who made him as also Moses was in all God's house."
58,3,3,"For he has been thought worthy of more glory than Moses, just as he who has built a house has more honor than the house."
58,3,4,"For every house is built by some one, but he who built all things is God."
58,3,5,"Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant for a testimony to the things that were to be spoken,"
58,3,6,"but Christ as a Son over his own house. We are his house if we hold firmly to the end our confidence and the hope of which we boast."
58,3,7,"Wherefore, as the Holy Spirit says, To-day if you will hear his voice,"
58,3,8,"do not harden your hearts as when they made me angry on the day when they tried me in the desert,"
58,3,9,"when your fathers put me to a test and saw my deeds for forty years."
58,3,10,"Therefore I was much displeased with that generation and said, 'They always go astray in their hearts and they do not know my paths.'"
58,3,11,"So I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter into my rest.'"
58,3,12,"See to it, brethren, that there shall not be in any one of you a wicked, unbelieving heart ready to forsake the living God,"
58,3,13,"but encourage one another daily while it is called to-day, that no one may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
58,3,14,"For we become sharers with Christ if we hold firmly to the end the assurance with which we began."
58,3,15,"When it is said, To-day if you will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as when they made me angry \'97"
58,3,16,"who when they heard made him angry? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt with Moses?"
58,3,17,"With whom was he much displeased for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?"
58,3,18,"To whom did he swear that they should not enter his rest, except to those who had no faith?"
58,3,19,"We see that they were unable to enter because of their lack of faith."
58,4,1,"LET us, then, be afraid that, though the promise of entering his rest is still left, some one of you may seem to have missed it."
58,4,2,"For we have received the good news just as they did, but the message that was heard did not benefit them, since it did not meet with faith in the hearers."
58,4,3,"For we who have faith are entering into the rest, as he said, As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter into my rest,'  although his works had been finished since the creation of the world."
58,4,4,"For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day thus, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,"
58,4,5,"and in this place again, They shall not enter into my rest."
58,4,6,"Since, then, it remains for some to enter into it, and those who first received the good news did not enter because of lack of faith \'97"
58,4,7,"again he indicates a day, to-day, saying in David so long after, as has been already quoted, To-day if you will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."
58,4,8,"For if Joshua had given them rest he would not be speaking of another day after that."
58,4,9,"Therefore there still remains a rest for the people of God."
58,4,10,"For he who has entered into God's rest has rested from his works as God did from his."
58,4,11,"Let us endeavor then to enter into that rest so that no one shall fall, after that example of lack of faith."
58,4,12,"For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any two-edged sword, and it pierces until it divides soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and it judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart."
58,4,13,"There is not a creature invisible to him, but all things are naked and defenseless before the eyes of him to whom we must account."
58,4,14,"Since, then, we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession."
58,4,15,"For we have not a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, for he has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet without sin."
58,4,16,"Therefore let us come with confidence to the throne of grace and receive compassion and find grace for timely help."
58,5,1,"FOR every high priest taken from among men is appointed in behalf of men in things relating to God to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins."
58,5,2,"He is able to sympathize with the ignorant and the erring, since he himself is beset with weaknesses."
58,5,3,"For this reason he must bring an offering for his own sins, just as he does for those of the people."
58,5,4,"And no one takes this honor upon himself unless called by God, as Aaron was."
58,5,5,"So too Christ did not take for himself the glory of becoming a high priest, but he who said to him, Thou art my Son, to-day I have become thy Father,"
58,5,6,"and who says in another place, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."
58,5,7,"Christ, in the days of his flesh, offered prayers and supplications to him who was able to save him from death, with strong outcries and tears, and was heard and saved from his terrors."
58,5,8,"Although he was a Son he learned obedience from his sufferings,"
58,5,9,"and being thus made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him,"
58,5,10,"and was proclaimed by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek."
58,5,11,"Regarding Melchizedek we have much to say that is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing."
58,5,12,"For when, considering the time, you ought to be teachers you need to have some one teach you again the first principles of the revelations of God. You have come to need milk and not solid food."
58,5,13,"For every one who takes milk is inexperienced in the doctrine of righteousness, for he is a child."
58,5,14,"But solid food is for adults who through practice have their senses exercised in distinguishing good and bad."
58,6,1,"THEREFORE let us leave elementary teaching about Christ and hasten on to what is advanced, not laying again a foundation \'97 change of heart from dead works, faith in God,"
58,6,2,"the teaching about baptisms, the laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment."
58,6,3,"This we will do if God permits."
58,6,4,"For it is impossible for those who have been once for all enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift and have become sharers in the Holy Spirit"
58,6,5,"and have tasted God's word and the powers of the coming world,"
58,6,6,"and then have fallen away, to have again a change of heart, since they are crucifying for themselves afresh the Son of God and putting him to open shame."
58,6,7,"For ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it and bears plants useful to those for whom it is farmed shares in God's blessing;"
58,6,8,"but if it bears thorns and thistles it is judged worthless and is near to being cursed. In the end it will be burnt over."
58,6,9,"But we are persuaded of better things regarding you, beloved, things that belong with salvation, though we thus speak."
58,6,10,"For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love that you have shown to his name as you have served and are still serving the holy."
58,6,11,"But we desire to have each one of you show to the end the same earnestness for the fulfillment of our hope,"
58,6,12,"that you may not be dull, but imitators of those who through faith and patience are inheriting the promises."
58,6,13,"For God, when making the promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, swore by himself,"
58,6,14,"saying, Surely, I will greatly bless you and greatly multiply you."
58,6,15,"And so after patient waiting Abraham obtained what was promised."
58,6,16,"For men swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them the end of all dispute."
58,6,17,"In this case God being abundantly willing to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable purpose of his will gave the surety of an oath,"
58,6,18,"that by two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible for God to be false, we might have strong encouragement, we who have fled to lay hold on the hope that lies before us."
58,6,19,"We have this hope as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and it enters into the tent within the curtain"
58,6,20,"where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered in our behalf, becoming forever a high priest after the order of Melchizedek."
58,7,1,"FOR, this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham when he was returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,"
58,7,2,"and to whom Abraham gave a tenth of all"
58,7,3,"without father, without mother, without ancestors, without either birthday or end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest permanently."
58,7,4,"But see how great this man was, since Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of his choicest spoils."
58,7,5,"And even those of the sons of Levi who attain the priesthood have command according to the Law to take a tenth from the people, their own brethren, although these have sprung from the loins of Abraham."
58,7,6,"But he who had no genealogy from these took a tenth from Abraham and pronounced a blessing on him who had the promises."
58,7,7,"Without dispute the less is blessed by the greater."
58,7,8,"And here mortal men receive tenths, but there one of whom the witness is that he is living."
58,7,9,"And, to put it frankly, Levi, who receives the tenths, was made to pay a tenth through Abraham."
58,7,10,"For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met Abraham."
58,7,11,"If, then, perfection had been through the Levitical priesthood, \'97 for on the basis of that the people received the Law \'97 what need was there for another kind of priest to arise and not be called of the order of Aaron?"
58,7,12,"For when the priesthood has been changed there comes of necessity also a change of law."
58,7,13,"For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has ever had anything to do with the altar."
58,7,14,"For it is plain that our Lord has arisen from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests."
58,7,15,"And this is yet more abundantly evident if after the order of Melchizedek there arises a priest of a different kind"
58,7,16,"who has become such, not according to the law of a commandment made for the flesh, but according to the power of unending life."
58,7,17,"For it is affirmed of him, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."
58,7,18,"There is a setting aside of the earlier commandment because of its weakness and uselessness \'97"
58,7,19,"for the Law brought nothing to perfection \'97 and there is the bringing in of a better hope through which we draw near to God."
58,7,20,"And just as it was not without an oath \'97"
58,7,21,"for those men have become priests without an oath, but he with an oath from him who said to him, The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: thou art a priest forever \'97"
58,7,22,"by so much better is the covenant of which Jesus has become surety."
58,7,23,"And many of them became priests because they were prevented by death from continuing,"
58,7,24,"but he, because he continues forever, has an unending priesthood."
58,7,25,"And so he is able to save perfectly those who come to God through him, since he is forever living to intercede for them."
58,7,26,"For such was the High Priest that we needed, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens."
58,7,27,"He has not the daily need, like the other priests, first to offer sacrifices for his own sins and then for those of the people. This latter he did once for all when he offered himself."
58,7,28,"For the Law makes high priests of men who have infirmities, but the word of the oath, which comes after the Law, makes High Priest of a Son who is perfected forever."
58,8,1,"THE chief point of what I have been saying is this: we have such a High Priest who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens,"
58,8,2,"and who ministers in the holy place and in the true Tent set up by the Lord, not by man."
58,8,3,"Now every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. Whence it is necessary for this one to have something to offer."
58,8,4,"If he were upon the earth he would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law."
58,8,5,"They minister as an example and shadow of the things in heaven, just as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the Tent. See, it was said, that you make everything according to the model shown you on the mountain."
58,8,6,"But now Christ has obtained a ministry as much more excellent as the covenant of which he is mediator is better and based upon better promises."
58,8,7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless a place would not have been sought for a second."
58,8,8,"But finding fault with it he says, The days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah a new covenant,"
58,8,9,"not in the manner of the covenant which I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. For they did not abide by my covenant and I ceased to care for them, says the Lord."
58,8,10,"This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their minds and will write them upon their hearts and I will be their God and they will be my people."
58,8,11,"They shall not teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother saying, 'Know the Lord'; for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them,"
58,8,12,"and I will be merciful to their wrong-doings and their sins I will remember no more."
58,8,13,"In saying new he has pronounced the first covenant old. But what grows old and decadent is near to disappearance."
58,9,1,"THE first covenant had regulations of worship and its holy building in this world."
58,9,2,"For a Tent was erected, in the first part of which were the lampstand and the table and the consecrated bread. This was called the Holy Place."
58,9,3,"Behind the second curtain was the part called the Holy of Holies."
58,9,4,"It had the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant all covered with gold. In this was a golden jar with the manna and Aaron's rod that sprouted and the tablets of the covenant."
58,9,5,"Above it were cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of propitiation. Regarding these things it is not now possible to speak in detail."
58,9,6,"But these things being thus arranged, the priests go constantly into the first part of the Tent, performing their services,"
58,9,7,"but into the second part the High Priest alone goes once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins ignorantly committed by the people."
58,9,8,"The Holy Spirit shows this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been made plain while the first Tent is standing."
58,9,9,"That is a symbol, for the time being, in accordance with which gifts and sacrifices are offered, though they cannot make the worshiper perfect in his conscience,"
58,9,10,"since they consist only of foods and drinks and various baths \'97 rules respecting the flesh, imposed until the time of reformation."
58,9,11,"But when Christ came as High Priest of the good things that have come, he entered once for all through the greater and more perfect Tent not made by hands \'97 that is, not of this creation \'97"
58,9,12,"and not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, into the holy place, and thereby found eternal redemption."
58,9,13,"For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the defiled, makes them holy as regards purity of their flesh,"
58,9,14,"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through an eternal Spirit offered himself an unblemished sacrifice to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works for the service of the living God."
58,9,15,"For this reason he is the mediator of a better covenant that, a death having taken place for redemption from sins under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the eternal inheritance promised to them."
58,9,16,"For where there is a last will and testament the death of the testator must be put in evidence."
58,9,17,"For a will is valid in the case of the dead: it never has any force while the testator is living."
58,9,18,"Hence the first covenant was not introduced without blood."
58,9,19,"When all the commands of the Law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled it on the book and on all the people,"
58,9,20,"saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded for you."
58,9,21,"And the Tent and all the things used in worship he likewise sprinkled with blood."
58,9,22,"Almost everything is cleansed with blood, according to the Law, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness."
58,9,23,"It was necessary, then, that the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."
58,9,24,"For Christ did not enter into a holy place made by hands, a copy of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God in our behalf."
58,9,25,"Nor was it to offer himself often, as the High Priest enters into the holy place every year with blood not his own;"
58,9,26,"then he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now, once for all, at the end of the ages, he has appeared to do away with sin by his sacrifice."
58,9,27,"And as it is appointed for men once for all to die and after this comes judgment,"
58,9,28,"so Christ was once for all offered to bear the sins of many and will appear the second time, apart from sin, to those who are looking for him, and bring them salvation."
58,10,1,"FOR the Law with a shadow of the good things that are coming, but not the very likeness of the things, cannot, by the same sacrifices which they offer constantly every year, ever make perfect those who come,"
58,10,2,"since would they not have ceased offering them? Because the worshipers, once for all cleansed, would have had no consciousness of sins."
58,10,3,"But in the sacrifices these are called to mind every year."
58,10,4,"For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to take away sins."
58,10,5,"Therefore on coming into the world he says, Sacrifice and offering thou dost not desire: a body thou hast prepared for me."
58,10,6,"Whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou dost not delight in."
58,10,7,"Then I said, 'Here I have come \'97 in the roll of the book it is written of me \'97 to do thy will, O God.' "
58,10,8,"He first says, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou dost not desire nor delight in, such as are offered according to the Law,"
58,10,9,"and then he says, Here I have come to do thy will. He takes away the first to establish the second."
58,10,10,"By this will we are made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."
58,10,11,"Every priest stands daily doing service and offering many times the same sacrifices, although they never can take away sins."
58,10,12,"But this Priest after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, took his seat at the right hand of God,"
58,10,13,"for the future only waiting until his enemies are made his footstool."
58,10,14,"For by one offering he has forever perfected those who are made holy."
58,10,15,"The Holy Spirit testifies this to us; for after having said,"
58,10,16,"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts and on their minds I will write them, he adds,"
58,10,17,"and their sins and their law-breakings I will remember no more."
58,10,18,"But where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin."
58,10,19,"Since we have, then, brethren, confidence in entering the holy place through the blood of Jesus,"
58,10,20,"by the new and living way which he has made for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh,"
58,10,21,"and since we have a great Priest over the house of God,"
58,10,22,"let us come with true hearts in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies bathed in pure water."
58,10,23,"Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful who has promised,"
58,10,24,"and let us keep watch to incite one another to love and noble deeds,"
58,10,25,"not neglecting to assemble yourselves, as some do, but encouraging one another, and so much the more, as you see the day drawing near."
58,10,26,"For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there remains no longer any sacrifice for sins,"
58,10,27,"but a dreadful expectation of doom and a fury of fire that will devour the opposers."
58,10,28,"Any one who sets aside a law of Moses dies without pity on the testimony of two or three witnesses."
58,10,29,"Of how much worse punishment do you think he will be judged worthy who has trampled on the Son of God, who has thought the blood of the covenant, by which it was made holy, an unholy thing, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?"
58,10,30,"For we know him who said, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, and again, The Lord will judge his people."
58,10,31,"It is dreadful to fall into the hands of the living God."
58,10,32,"Remember the early days in which, after being enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings,"
58,10,33,"at one time made a public spectacle by reproaches and distresses, at another time making common cause with those who were thus treated."
58,10,34,"For you even suffered with the prisoners and accepted the plundering of your property with joy, knowing that you had a better and enduring possession."
58,10,35,"Do not, then, cast away your confidence, for it will have a great reward."
58,10,36,"You have need of patience so that after doing the will of God you may gain the promised blessing."
58,10,37,"For yet a little, very little, while, and he who is coming will come and will not delay."
58,10,38,"My righteous man will live by faith; but if he shrinks back, my soul has no delight in him."
58,10,39,"But we are not of those who shrink back and perish, but of those who have faith and will win their souls."
58,11,1,"FAITH is an assurance of things hoped for, a conviction of things not seen."
58,11,2,"By this the men of old won their fame."
58,11,3,"By faith we understand that the worlds came into order at the word of God, so that what is now seen did not come out of things that are visible."
58,11,4,"By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, for which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God testifying to his gifts, and by it, though dead, he still speaks."
58,11,5,"By faith Enoch was taken from the earth so that he did not see death, and he was not found because God had taken him. For before being taken he had this testimony that he had pleased God."
58,11,6,"But without faith it is impossible to please him. For he who comes to God must have faith that he exists and that he becomes the rewarder of those who seek him."
58,11,7,"By faith Noah, after receiving a divine warning regarding things as yet unseen, reverently built an ark for the saving of his household. Thus he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness of faith."
58,11,8,"By faith Abraham when called obeyed and came out into the place which he was to obtain for an inheritance. He came out not knowing where he was coming."
58,11,9,"By faith he made his home in the promised land as in a foreign country, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise."
58,11,10,"For he was looking for the city that has the foundations, whose architect and builder is God."
58,11,11,"By faith Sarah received power to conceive a child even when past the natural time of life, since she thought him trustworthy who had given the promise."
58,11,12,"And so from just one man, already dead in that respect, there sprang descendants as the stars of heaven in multitude and as the sand on the seashore innumerable."
58,11,13,"These all died in faith, not having obtained the promised blessings, but they saw them and greeted them afar and confessed that they were strangers and foreigners in the land."
58,11,14,"For those who say such things make it plain that they are seeking a fatherland."
58,11,15,"And if they had been thinking of that land from which they came they would have had opportunity to return."
58,11,16,"But now they desire a better land, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them \'97 of being called their God; for he has prepared for them a city."
58,11,17,"By faith Abraham when he was tested offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises began offering his only son"
58,11,18,"regarding whom it had been said, Those only whose descent is through Isaac shall be called your descendants."
58,11,19,"He reasoned that God was able to raise him even from the dead, and figuratively he did win him back from the dead."
58,11,20,"By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau and spoke of things to come."
58,11,21,"By faith Jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped leaning on the top of his staff."
58,11,22,"By faith Joseph, when at his end, mentioned the departure of the children of Israel and gave orders regarding his own bones."
58,11,23,"By faith Moses at his birth was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they did not fear the king's command."
58,11,24,"By faith Moses when he had grown up refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter."
58,11,25,"He chose rather to suffer hard-ship with the people of God than to enjoy the brief pleasure of sin,"
58,11,26,"and he thought the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt. For he was looking to the final reward."
58,11,27,"By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; for he endured as if seeing him who is unseen."
58,11,28,"By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer might not touch their first-born."
58,11,29,"By faith they crossed the Red Sea as on dry land; but the Egyptians when they tried to do so were drowned."
58,11,30,"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled seven days."
58,11,31,"By faith Rahab, the prostitute, did not perish with those who had refused to believe; because she had welcomed the spies with peace."
58,11,32,"And what shall I say further? Time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, and of David and Samuel and the prophets;"
58,11,33,"who through faith struggled against kingdoms and subdued them, did deeds of righteousness, obtained promised blessings, shut the mouths of lions,"
58,11,34,"quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness grew strong, became mighty in war, turned back armies of foreigners."
58,11,35,"Women received back their dead by a resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing to pay for liberation, in order to gain a better resurrection."
58,11,36,"Still others had experience of mockings and floggings, yes, of chains and prisons."
58,11,37,"They were stoned, afflicted, sawn in two, murdered with the sword. They went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, destitute, distressed, maltreated."
58,11,38,"The world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, in caves and in holes in the earth."
58,11,39,"All these won God's approval by their faith. Yet they did not obtain the fulfillment of the promise."
58,11,40,"In reference to us God had something better in view, that they without us should not reach perfection."
58,12,1,"THEREFORE, surrounded as we are by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily besets us, and let us run with patience the race that lies before us,"
58,12,2,"looking to Jesus the beginner and finisher of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured a cross, thinking little of the shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God."
58,12,3,"Think of him who endured such hostile speaking of sinners against him, that you may not grow weary and despondent in heart."
58,12,4,"You have not yet resisted to blood in the contest against sin,"
58,12,5,"and you have forgotten the encouragement which reasons with you as with sons, My son, do not think slightingly of the discipline of the Lord and be not faint-hearted when reproved by him:"
58,12,6,"for whom the Lord loves he disciplines and scourges every son whom he receives as his own."
58,12,7,"It is for discipline that you are enduring. God is laying it upon you as upon sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?"
58,12,8,"But if you are without discipline, in which all share, then you are bastards and not sons."
58,12,9,"Besides, we had fathers of our flesh who disciplined us and we used to reverence them. Shall we not much more be submissive to the Father of our spirits and live?"
58,12,10,"For they for a few days disciplined us as seemed good to them, but he for our profit, that we may share his holiness."
58,12,11,"All discipline for the time being seems not joyous but grievous, but afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have passed through its training."
58,12,12,"So raise the relaxed hands and straighten the unstrung knees"
58,12,13,"and make straight paths for your feet, so that the lame limb may not be put out of joint but rather cured."
58,12,14,"Follow after peace with all men and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord."
58,12,15,"Be on your guard that no one shall fail of the grace of God, that no bitter root shall sprout up and trouble you and through it many be stained,"
58,12,16,"that there shall be none unchaste, or profane like Esau, who for one meal sold his birthright."
58,12,17,"For you know that afterward when he wished to inherit the blessing he was rejected, for he found no place for a change in his father's mind though he sought it earnestly with tears."
58,12,18,"For you have not come to something that may be touched, ablaze with fire, and to blackness and darkness and tempest"
58,12,19,"and the blast of a trumpet and the sound of words which those who heard begged not to have spoken of them."
58,12,20,"For they could not bear the command, If even an animal touches the mountain it must be stoned."
58,12,21,"And so dreadful was the sight that Moses said, I am terrified and trembling."
58,12,22,"But you have come to Mount Zion and the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, to tens of thousands of angels,"
58,12,23,"to the festal assembly and congregation of first-born who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,"
58,12,24,"and to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant and to the sprinkled blood which tells something better than the blood of Abel."
58,12,25,"Beware of rejecting him who is speaking. For if those did not escape who rejected him who taught the divine will on earth, much less shall we if we reject him who speaks from heaven."
58,12,26,"His voice then shook the earth, but now he has announced, Yet once for all I shall shake not only the earth but also heaven."
58,12,27,"And this expression yet once for all shows the removal of the things shaken, as of things that have been made, that the unshaken things may remain."
58,12,28,"So then, since we are receiving an unshaken kingdom, let us have grace by which we may worship God acceptably with reverence and awe."
58,12,29,"For our God is a consuming fire."
58,13,1,"LET brotherly love continue."
58,13,2,"Do not forget hospitality: for by this some have, without knowing it, had angels as their guests."
58,13,3,"Keep in mind the prisoners, as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are suffering hardships, since you yourselves are also in the body."
58,13,4,"Let marriage be held in honor by all and let the bed be undefiled; for unchaste persons and adulterers God will judge."
58,13,5,"Let your lives be free from the love of money. Be content with what you have. For he has said, I will not fail you nor will I forsake you."
58,13,6,"So we may say with courage, The Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?"
58,13,7,"Remember your leaders, those who have spoken to you God's message, think how they ended their lives and imitate their faith."
58,13,8,"Jesus Christ is yesterday and to-day the same \'97 yes, and through the ages."
58,13,9,"Do not be carried away with all sorts of foreign teachings. It is well to have the heart strengthened by grace, not by special kinds of food. Those who live in that way are not profited."
58,13,10,"We have an altar of which those who worship in the Tent have no right to eat."
58,13,11,"For the bodies of the animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the High Priest are burned outside the camp."
58,13,12,"For this reason Jesus also, to make the people holy by his own blood, suffered outside the gate."
58,13,13,"Let us go out to him outside the camp and bear the reproaches cast on him."
58,13,14,"For we have here no continuing city, but we are seeking the coming one."
58,13,15,"Through him then let us offer to God always the sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips that make confession in his name."
58,13,16,"Do not forget kindness and generosity, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."
58,13,17,"Obey your leaders and yield to their authority; for they watch over your souls as those who must give account, that they may do it with joy and not with sighing. That would be unprofitable for you."
58,13,18,"Pray for us: for we are confident that we have a good conscience, wishing to live nobly in every way."
58,13,19,"I earnestly beg you to do this that I may be restored to you the sooner."
58,13,20,"May the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of an eternal covenant,"
58,13,21,"equip you with every good thing for doing his will, doing in you what is well-pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for the ages of the ages. Amen."
58,13,22,"I beg you, brethren, to bear with my words of exhortation; for I have written to you briefly."
58,13,23,"I wish you to know that our brother Timothy has been set at liberty. With him, if he comes soon, I will see you."
58,13,24,"Give my greetings to all your leaders and all the holy. Those who are from Italy send their greetings to you."
58,13,25,"Grace be with you all."
59,1,1,"JAMES, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the Twelve Tribes which are scattered in foreign lands: Greeting."
59,1,2,"Think it all joy, my brethren, when you fall into all sorts of trials,"
59,1,3,"since you know that the testing of your faith brings out endurance."
59,1,4,"Let endurance do its complete work, that you may be complete and perfect, lacking in nothing."
59,1,5,"If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him ask it from God, who gives to all freely without reproaching, and it will be given to him."
59,1,6,"But he must ask in faith with never a doubt. For he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed."
59,1,7,"For that man must not think that he will obtain anything from the Lord \'97"
59,1,8,"a two-minded man unsteady in all his ways."
59,1,9,"Let the lowly brother glory in his high station,"
59,1,10,"and let the rich brother glory in his lowly station, for he will pass away like a flower of the grass."
59,1,11,"For the sun rises with scorching heat and dries up the grass, and the flower of it falls and the beauty of its face perishes. So shall the rich man wither in his pursuits."
59,1,12,"Blessed is the man who endures trial, for when he has been tested he will gain the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love him."
59,1,13,"No one must say when tempted, My temptation comes from God. For God cannot be tempted by evil, and he tempts no one."
59,1,14,"Every one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own passions and enticed."
59,1,15,"Then when passion has conceived it gives birth to sin, and sin, when it is full grown, gives birth to death."
59,1,16,"Make no mistake, my beloved brethren,"
59,1,17,"every good gift and every perfect boon is from above; it descends from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change or shadow caused by turning."
59,1,18,"Of his own will he made us his children through the message of truth, so that we might be a sort of first fruits of his creatures."
59,1,19,"I wish you to know this, my beloved brethren: Every man must be quick to hear, but slow to speak, slow to anger."
59,1,20,"For a man's anger does not work out God's righteousness."
59,1,21,"So lay aside all that is vile and all that remains of malice, and receive with gentleness the implanted message which can save your souls."
59,1,22,"Become doers of the message and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves."
59,1,23,"For if one is a hearer of the message and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror."
59,1,24,"He looks at himself and is gone, and immediately forgets what sort of man he was."
59,1,25,"But he who looks earnestly into the perfect law of liberty and continues to do so, and becomes not a forgetful hearer but a doer of work \'97 that man will be blessed in what he does."
59,1,26,"If any one thinks himself religious while he does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, that man's religion is worthless."
59,1,27,"Pure and stainless religion in the sight of God the Father is to visit orphans and widows in their trouble and to keep one's self unspotted from the world."
59,2,1,"MY brethren, do not hold the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with partiality for persons."
59,2,2,"For if there comes into your assembly a man with gold rings and in fine clothes, and there comes in a poor man in soiled clothes,"
59,2,3,"and you look up to the man who is wearing the fine clothes and say, Take this good seat, and say to the poor man, Stand there, or Sit under my footstool,"
59,2,4,"are you not making distinctions in your own minds and have you not become judges with wicked thoughts?"
59,2,5,"Listen, my beloved brethren, did not God choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?"
59,2,6,"But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you before courts?"
59,2,7,"Do they not speak profanely of the noble name by which you are called?"
59,2,8,"If you keep the royal law according to the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, you do well."
59,2,9,"But if you have partiality, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as law-breakers."
59,2,10,"For he who keeps the whole law, but stumbles in one point, has become guilty of all."
59,2,11,"For he who said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not commit murder. If you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a law-breaker."
59,2,12,"So speak and so act as those who are soon to be judged by a law of liberty."
59,2,13,"For judgment is merciless to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment."
59,2,14,"Of what use is it, my brethren, for any one to say that he has faith, if he has not works? Can faith save him?"
59,2,15,"If a brother or sister is naked and lacks food for the day"
59,2,16,"and one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and fed, but you do not give them what the body needs, what is the good of it?"
59,2,17,"Just so faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead."
59,2,18,"But some one will say, You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith without your works and I will show you my faith by my works."
59,2,19,"You have faith that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons have that faith, and they shudder."
59,2,20,"Are you willing to learn, O vacant-minded man, that faith without works is useless?"
59,2,21,"Was not Abraham, our father, pronounced righteous because of works when he laid Isaac his son on the altar?"
59,2,22,"You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was made perfect"
59,2,23,"and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham had faith in God and it was credited to him for righteousness and he was called God's friend."
59,2,24,"You see that a man is pronounced righteous because of works and not because of faith alone."
59,2,25,"In the same way was not Rahab, the prostitute, pronounced righteous because of works when she had received the messengers and sent them out by a different road?"
59,2,26,"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead."
59,3,1,"DO not, many of you, become teachers, my brethren, for you know that we will receive severer judgment."
59,3,2,"For in many ways we all stumble. If any one never stumbles in his talk, he is a perfect man, able to bridle also the whole body."
59,3,3,"If we put bits into the horses' mouths to make them obey us, we turn about their whole bodies."
59,3,4,"See the ships; great as they are and driven by violent winds, they are turned about by a very small rudder wherever the desire of the helmsman chooses."
59,3,5,"Just so the tongue is a small member, but boasts of great things. Think how small a fire may be and yet how vast the forest that it may set ablaze."
59,3,6,"And the tongue is a fire, a world of wickedness. The tongue stands among our members as that which spots the whole body and sets on fire the wheel of nature and is itself set on fire by Gehenna."
59,3,7,"For every kind of wild beasts and birds and reptiles and animals from the sea is tamed and has been tamed by human kind,"
59,3,8,"but the tongue no man is able to tame. It is a restless evil; it is full of deadly poison."
59,3,9,"With it we bless the Lord our Father and with it we curse the men who are made in the image of God."
59,3,10,"From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. This, my brethren, should not be so."
59,3,11,"Does a spring pour out from the same opening sweet water and bitter?"
59,3,12,"Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a vine figs? No more can salt water yield fresh water."
59,3,13,"Who is wise and intelligent among you? Let him show out of the noble life that he lives his works in wise gentleness."
59,3,14,"But if you have bitter jealousy and party-spirit in your hearts, do not boast and falsely contradict the truth."
59,3,15,"This wisdom does not come down from on high, but is earthly, animal, demoniacal."
59,3,16,"For where jealousy and party-spirit are, there is confusion and every base affair."
59,3,17,"But the wisdom from on high is first pure, then peaceable, fair-minded, easily persuaded, full of compassion and good fruits, impartial, sincere."
59,3,18,"The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace."
59,4,1,"WHENCE come wars and whence come strifes among you? Is it not from your pleasures which carry on war in your members?"
59,4,2,"You long for something and do not have it. You murder and envy and cannot obtain it. You battle and war. You do not have, because of your not asking."
59,4,3,"You ask and do not receive, because you ask wickedly to waste it on your pleasures."
59,4,4,"You adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity to God? Whoever chooses to be a friend to the world stands as an enemy of God."
59,4,5,"Do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose? Does the Spirit which he made dwell in us long enviously?"
59,4,6,"But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says, God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
59,4,7,"Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the Devil and he will flee from you."
59,4,8,"Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Make your hands clean, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded."
59,4,9,"Be sorrowful and mourn and lament. Let your laughter be turned into grief and your gladness into gloom."
59,4,10,"Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you."
59,4,11,"Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law you are not a doer of the law, but a judge."
59,4,12,"One is the Lawgiver and Judge \'97 he who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you, to judge your neighbor?"
59,4,13,"Come, now, you who say, To-day or to-morrow we will go to such a city and spend a year and do business and make money,"
59,4,14,"though you do not know what your life will be like on the morrow. For you are a vapor that appears for a little while and then disappears."
59,4,15,"You should rather say, If the Lord wills it, we shall live and do this or that."
59,4,16,"But now you glory in bragging. All such glorying is evil."
59,4,17,"If any one, then, knows how to do good and is not doing it, he is committing sin."
59,5,1,"COME, now, you rich men, wail and lament over the miseries that are coming upon you."
59,5,2,"Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten,"
59,5,3,"your gold and silver are rusted over and the rust on them will be an evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire."
59,5,4,"You have laid up treasures in the last days. See, the wages of the laborers who reaped your fields, fraudulently kept back by you, call aloud, and the cries of the harvesters have come into the ears of the Lord of armies."
59,5,5,"You have lived luxuriously in the land and have given yourselves up to pleasure. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter."
59,5,6,"You have condemned, you have murdered, the righteous; he does not resist you."
59,5,7,"Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the ground and is patient over it until he receives the early and the late rains."
59,5,8,"You too must be patient. Keep your hearts steadfast, for the coming of the Lord is near."
59,5,9,"Do not fret at one another, brethren, and then you will not be judged. The Judge is standing before your doors."
59,5,10,"Take, brethren, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord as an example of patience in suffering evil."
59,5,11,"We call them blessed because they endured. You have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord's dealings with him, that the Lord is very tender and compassionate."
59,5,12,"Above all things, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by the earth or by any other oath. Let your yes be yes and your no be no, that you may not fall under condemnation."
59,5,13,"Is any one of you suffering hardship? Let him pray. Is any one cheerful? Let him sing with the harp."
59,5,14,"Is any one of you sick? Let him call in the elders of the church and let them pray over him and anoint him with olive oil in the name of the Lord."
59,5,15,"The prayer of faith will save the sick and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins they will be forgiven him."
59,5,16,"Confess your sins to one another and pray for one another in order to be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man has great power."
59,5,17,"Elijah was a man of the same weaknesses as ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months."
59,5,18,"Then he prayed again and heaven gave rain and the land brought forth its fruits."
59,5,19,"My brethren, if one of you strays from the truth and any one brings him back,"
59,5,20,"I wish you to know that he who brings back a sinner from his wanderings will save his soul from death and will hide a host of sins."
60,1,1,"PETER, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the Chosen Ones of the scattered Jews in foreign lands who are living in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia \'97"
60,1,2,"chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father and made holy by the Spirit to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood: Grace be to you and peace be multiplied."
60,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead \'97"
60,1,4,"a birth into an inheritance immortal, unstained and unfading, kept in heaven for you"
60,1,5,"who are guarded by the power of God through faith for the salvation which is ready to be revealed on the last day."
60,1,6,"In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you are sorrowful in trials of many kinds,"
60,1,7,"so that your tested faith, much more precious than gold that perishes though tested by fire, may be found to your praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed,"
60,1,8,"whom you love though you have not seen him; in whom you have faith though now you do not see him, and you rejoice with unspeakable and glorious joy"
60,1,9,"while you receive the reward of your faith, the salvation of your souls."
60,1,10,"Regarding this salvation the prophets who foretold the grace that was to come to you"
60,1,11,"inquired and searched, trying to find out what time, or what sort of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in them was disclosing when it witnessed beforehand regarding the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow."
60,1,12,"It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who have told you the good news by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven \'97 things which angels earnestly long to look into."
60,1,13,"Therefore brace up your minds, be calm and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed."
60,1,14,"As obedient children, do not shape your lives by the passions that ruled you in the former days of ignorance,"
60,1,15,"but, like the Holy One who has called you, become yourselves holy in all your way of life,"
60,1,16,"for it is written, You shall be holy because I am holy."
60,1,17,"And if you call upon him as Father who impartially judges by each one's work, live out the time of your sojourn here in reverence,"
60,1,18,"for you know that you were not ransomed with perishable things, silver or gold, from your purposeless life handed down from your forefathers,"
60,1,19,"but by precious blood, as of a faultless, spotless lamb, the blood of Christ,"
60,1,20,"who was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of time for your sake"
60,1,21,"who through him are faithful to God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God."
60,1,22,"Now that you have made your souls holy by obedience to the truth for sincere brotherly love, you must love one another steadily from your hearts,"
60,1,23,"for you have been reborn, not from mortal seed but from immortal by the living and enduring word of God."
60,1,24,"For All flesh is like grass and all its glory is like the flower of the grass; the grass withers and the flower falls,"
60,1,25,"but the word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the word of good news that has been brought to you."
60,2,1,"THEN lay aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and every kind of slander,"
60,2,2,"and, like new-born babes, long for the reasonable pure milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation,"
60,2,3,"if you have tasted that the Lord is kind."
60,2,4,"Coming to him, a living stone, rejected by men but with the Lord chosen and precious,"
60,2,5,"you also as living stones are built up, a spiritual house, and become a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
60,2,6,"Therefore it is contained in Scripture, See, I am laying in Zion a chosen stone, an honored corner stone. He who has faith in him will not be put to shame."
60,2,7,"To you who have faith is the honor, but to the unbelieving the stone which the builders rejected \'97 that has become the corner stone,"
60,2,8,"a stone for the foot to strike, a rock to stumble over. Their feet strike the message because of their unbelief, and to this they were destined."
60,2,9,"But you are a chosen race, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, God's own people, that you may proclaim the virtues of him who called you from darkness into his wonderful light."
60,2,10,"Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God: once you had not found compassion, but now you have found compassion."
60,2,11,"Beloved, I beg you, as foreigners and resident aliens, to shun the passions of the flesh which war against the soul."
60,2,12,"Keep your daily life among the Gentiles honorable, so that, although they talk against you as if you were wrongdoers, they may, from your noble deeds that they see, glorify God on the day of inspection."
60,2,13,"Be submissive to every human institution for the Lord's sake, whether to the king as supreme,"
60,2,14,"or to governors as those sent by him for the punishment of wrongdoers and the praise of those who do good."
60,2,15,"For this is the will of God \'97 that by doing good we shall silence the ignorance of thoughtless men."
60,2,16,"Live as free men, yet not using freedom as a cloak for wickedness, but as God's slaves."
60,2,17,"Honor all men, love the brotherhood, reverence God, honor the king."
60,2,18,"Household servants, be submissive with all reverence to your lords, not only to the good and fair, but also to the surly."
60,2,19,"For this is grace if for conscience toward God any one bears pain, suffering unjustly."
60,2,20,"For what credit is it if when you sin and are struck with the fist you are patient? But if though doing well, you suffer and are patient, that is grace in God's sight."
60,2,21,"For to this you were called, because Christ too suffered for you, leaving you an example that you might follow in his foot-steps."
60,2,22,"He had done no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth."
60,2,23,"When he was reviled he did not revile back; he suffered, but made no threat; he committed himself to him who judges justly."
60,2,24,"He bore our sins in his own body on the tree that we might die to sins and live to righteousness."
60,2,25,"For you were going astray like sheep, but have now returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls."
60,3,1,"IN the same way you wives are to be submissive to your own husbands, so that if any disbelieve the message they may be won over by the lives of their wives without argument,"
60,3,2,"when they look at your pure, reverential behavior."
60,3,3,"Your adornment must not be of the external kind \'97 braiding the hair and putting on gold and wearing fine dresses;"
60,3,4,"but the hidden personality of the heart must wear the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is in God's sight most precious."
60,3,5,"For so of old the holy women who hoped in God adorned themselves. They were submissive to their own husbands,"
60,3,6,"as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him Master. You have become her children when you do well and feel no terror."
60,3,7,"In the same way, you husbands must live with your wives wisely, since woman's sex is weaker, but you must give them honor as fellow heirs of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered."
60,3,8,"Finally, all must be like-minded, sympathetic, full of brotherly love, compassionate, humble-minded,"
60,3,9,"not repaying evil for evil or abuse for abuse, but rather blessing, for that is what you were called for \'97 to inherit a blessing."
60,3,10,"For He who would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit."
60,3,11,"He must turn away from evil and do good; he must seek peace and pursue it."
60,3,12,"For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against wrongdoers."
60,3,13,"And who is it that will harm you if you become earnest for the good?"
60,3,14,"But if you should suffer for being righteous, you are blessed. Have no fear of them and do not be disturbed;"
60,3,15,"but exalt Christ as Lord in your hearts and be always ready to defend yourselves to every one who asks you to give account of the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence."
60,3,16,"Keep a good conscience that, although you are slandered, those who misrepresent your good life in Christ may be put to shame."
60,3,17,"For it is better to suffer, if that should be God's will, for doing good than for doing wrong."
60,3,18,"For Christ once for all died for sins, a righteous man for unrighteous men, so that he might lead us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit,"
60,3,19,"in which he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits"
60,3,20,"who were once disobedient, when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared, into which a few, that is eight souls, went and were saved through water."
60,3,21,"This is a type of baptism, which now saves us \'97 not the putting off of soil from the flesh, but the endeavor for a good conscience toward God through the resurrection of Jesus Christ."
60,3,22,"Now that he has gone into heaven he is at the right hand of God, and angels and authorities and powers have been made subject to him."
60,4,1,"SINCE, then, Christ suffered in the flesh, you also must arm yourselves with the same mind. For he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,"
60,4,2,"so that he does not go on living what remains of his time in the flesh according to human passions, but according to God's will."
60,4,3,"The time that has passed was enough to spend doing the will of the Gentiles, when you went on in indecencies, passions, hard drinking, revelries, carousings, and lawless idolatries."
60,4,4,"In these they think it strange that you are not running with them to the same excess of profligacy, and they slander you."
60,4,5,"But they will have to give account to him who holds himself ready to judge the living and the dead."
60,4,6,"And for this purpose the good news was told even to the dead, that they might be judged like men in the flesh, but live as God does in the spirit."
60,4,7,"The end of all things is near. Therefore be serious and sober and give yourselves to prayer."
60,4,8,"Above all things have earnest love to one another, for love hides a host of sins."
60,4,9,"Be hospitable to one another without grumbling."
60,4,10,"Let each, as he has received a spiritual gift, serve the others in that way, as good stewards of the varied grace of God."
60,4,11,"If any one speaks, let it be as uttering the oracles of God. If any one serves, let it be from the strength that God supplies. Thus in all things let God be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him be glory and strength for the ages of the ages! Amen."
60,4,12,"Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery fury that is among you, which has come to try you, as if some strange thing were happening to you."
60,4,13,"But rejoice since to this extent you are sharing the sufferings of Christ, that when his glory is revealed you may rejoice and exult."
60,4,14,"If you are reproached for the name of Christ you are blessed, for the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you."
60,4,15,"No one of you must suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as a wrongdoer or as a meddler in other men's affairs."
60,4,16,"But if he suffers as a Christian he should not be ashamed, but should glorify God by that name."
60,4,17,"For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God. And if it begins first with us, what will be the end of those who disobey the good news of God?"
60,4,18,"If the righteous is saved with difficulty, where will the godless and sinful appear?"
60,4,19,"So then let those who are suffering according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator."
60,5,1,"THE elders among you I beg \'97 I who am a fellow elder and a witness to the sufferings of Christ and a sharer in the glory soon to be revealed \'97"
60,5,2,"I beg you to shepherd the flock of God that is among you, not because you must, but willingly, not for base gain, but eagerly,"
60,5,3,"not lording it over your charges, but becoming examples to the flock."
60,5,4,"Then when the chief Shepherd appears you will be repaid with the never-fading crown of glory."
60,5,5,"In the same way you younger men must be subject to your elders. You all must put on the apron of humble service for one another. For God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
60,5,6,"Humble yourselves, then, under the mighty hand of God so that he may lift you up at the right time."
60,5,7,"Cast all your anxiety on him, for he cares for you."
60,5,8,"Be sober, watch. Your enemy the Devil, like a roaring lion, goes about seeking some one to devour."
60,5,9,"Resist him firm in the faith and knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being completed in your brotherhood throughout the world."
60,5,10,"The God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little will equip, establish and strengthen you."
60,5,11,"To him be power for the ages of the ages! Amen."
60,5,12,"By Silvanus, your faithful brother, as I esteem him, I am writing to you briefly, to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of God. Take your stand in it."
60,5,13,"She who is in Babylon, chosen with you, sends her greeting to you, and so does Mark my son."
60,5,14,"Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all in Christ."
61,1,1,"SIMON PETER, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have been allotted a faith as precious as ours:"
61,1,2,"Grace be to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord."
61,1,3,"Since his divine power has given us all things helpful to life and piety through the knowledge of him who has called us by his own glory and virtue,"
61,1,4,"and thereby great and precious promises have been granted to us, that through them you may escape the corruption that is in the world through passion and become sharers in the divine nature,"
61,1,5,"for this very reason make it your whole endeavor to supply to your faith virtue, and to your virtue knowledge,"
61,1,6,"and to your knowledge self-control, and to your self-control endurance, and to your endurance reverence,"
61,1,7,"and to your reverence brotherliness, and to your brotherliness love."
61,1,8,"For when you have these in abundance they make you to be neither idle nor fruitless regarding the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
61,1,9,"But he who lacks these is blind, dim-sighted, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins."
61,1,10,"Therefore endeavor more earnestly, brethren, to make sure that you have been called and chosen. For while doing these things you will never stumble."
61,1,11,"For so entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly provided for you."
61,1,12,"For this reason I shall always keep reminding you of these things, although you know them and are steadfast in the truth that you have."
61,1,13,"I think it right so long as I am in this tent to arouse you by reminding you,"
61,1,14,"since I know that the laying aside of my tent will come soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made plain to me."
61,1,15,"I will endeavor also on every occasion to make it so that after my going you shall have these things in memory."
61,1,16,"For we were not following cunningly devised myths when we told you of the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his majesty."
61,1,17,"For he received from God the Father honor and glory when such words as these were borne to him from the majestic glory, This is my Son, the Beloved; in him I delight."
61,1,18,"And this voice we heard borne from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain."
61,1,19,"Thus have we the words of the prophets confirmed, and you will do well to give attention to them as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts;"
61,1,20,"since you know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from any one's private interpretation,"
61,1,21,"for prophecy never came by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit."
61,2,1,"BUT false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among yourselves, and they will craftily bring in deadly heresies, even disowning the Lord who bought them and bringing on themselves quick ruin."
61,2,2,"Many will follow their shameless ways and by these the path of truth will be profanely spoken of."
61,2,3,"In covetousness they will make gain out of you by their cunning words. But their condemnation from of old has not been inactive, and their destruction has not been sleeping."
61,2,4,"For if God did not spare angels that had sinned, but thrust them down to Tartarus and committed them to pits of darkness to be kept for judgment,"
61,2,5,"and did not spare the ancient world, but guarded Noah, a herald of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought the flood on the world of the ungodly;"
61,2,6,"and if reducing to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah he condemned them to destruction, making them an example for the godless of what would come upon them,"
61,2,7,"and rescued righteous Lot worn out by the indecent lives of the lawless, \'97"
61,2,8,"for that righteous man living among them was tortured day and night in his righteous soul by the sight and hearing of their lawless deeds, \'97"
61,2,9,"the Lord knows how to rescue the pious from trial and how to keep the wicked under punishment for the day of judgment,"
61,2,10,"especially those who go after flesh in polluting passions, and despise lordship. They are daring, self-willed; they do not tremble to speak insultingly of glorious beings"
61,2,11,"even where angels greater in strength and power do not bring against them an insulting charge before the Lord."
61,2,12,"But they, like irrational creatures, born mere animals for capture and destruction, while speaking profanely of things they are ignorant of, will be corrupted by their own corruption,"
61,2,13,"and will suffer unrighteously as the reward of their own unrighteousness. They think it pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are spots and blots as they revel in their deceptions while they feast sumptuously with you."
61,2,14,"They have eyes engrossed with some adulteress, eyes which never cease from sin. They seduce unsteady souls. They have hearts practiced in covetousness. They are children of a curse."
61,2,15,"Leaving the straight path they have wandered away following the path of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness."
61,2,16,"But he was reproved for his sin; a dumb beast of draught, speaking with human voice, checked the madness of the prophet."
61,2,17,"These men are springs without water, storm-driven mists for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved."
61,2,18,"For by speaking great empty swelling words they entrap in the passions of the flesh \'97 wanton excesses \'97 those who are nearly escaping from those who live in error."
61,2,19,"While they promise them liberty they themselves are the slaves of corruption; for by whatever any one is overcome to that he is enslaved."
61,2,20,"For if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they have been again entangled and overcome, their last state has become worse than the first."
61,2,21,"For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment that has been committed to them."
61,2,22,"That has happened to them which the true proverb says, The dog returns to his own vomit and the sow after bathing returns to wallowing in the mire."
61,3,1,"THIS second letter, beloved, I am writing you. In both I have tried, by awakening your memory,"
61,3,2,"to arouse your honest minds to recall the predictions of the holy prophets and the commands of your apostles from the Lord and Savior."
61,3,3,"First you should know this, that in the last days scoffers will come with their scoffing, living according to their own passions"
61,3,4,"and saying, Where is his promised coming? for since the fathers fell asleep all things remain as they have been since the beginning of the creation?"
61,3,5,"For they willfully forget that there were heavens of old and an earth formed out of water and through water by God's word."
61,3,6,"By these means the world that then was was flooded with water and destroyed."
61,3,7,"But the present heavens and the earth are by the same word treasured up and kept for fire on the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men."
61,3,8,"Do not forget this one thing, beloved, that one day with the Lord is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like one day."
61,3,9,"The Lord is not slow about what he has promised, as some think of slowness, but is long-suffering toward us, wishing not to have any perish but to have all come to a change of heart."
61,3,10,"But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. On that day the heavens will pass away with a loud noise and the burning elements will be dissolved and the earth and the things in it will not be found."
61,3,11,"Since all of these things are to be dissolved, what sort of persons ought you to be in holy lives and piety,"
61,3,12,"you who are looking for and hastening toward the coming of the day of God, when the blazing heavens will be dissolved and the burning elements melted?"
61,3,13,"But according to his promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness will dwell."
61,3,14,"Therefore, beloved, since you expect this, endeavor earnestly to be found by him in peace, spotless and faultless,"
61,3,15,"and regard the long-suffering of our Lord as salvation, as also our beloved brother Paul has written to you, according to the wisdom given to him."
61,3,16,"So he writes in all his letters when speaking in them of these things. In those letters are some things hard to understand, and these the unlearned and unsteady twist, as they do the rest of the Scriptures, to their own ruin."
61,3,17,"You, then, beloved, since you know these things beforehand, be on your guard not to be led away by the error of the lawless and fall from your own steadfastness,"
61,3,18,"but grow in grace and in knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory now and to the day of eternity!"
62,1,1,"WHAT was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we looked upon and our hands touched \'97 it is about the Word of Life"
62,1,2,""
62,1,3,"what wo have seen and heard we are telling you also, so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ."
62,1,4,"We are writing this that our joy may be complete."
62,1,5,"This is the message which we have heard from him and tell to you, God is light and in him is no darkness at all."
62,1,6,"If we say, We have fellowship with him, and live in darkness, we lie and are not acting the truth."
62,1,7,"If we live in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin."
62,1,8,"If we say, We have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."
62,1,9,"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness:"
62,1,10,"If we say, We have not sinned, we make him a liar and his message is not in us."
62,2,1,"MY children, I am writing this to you in order that you may not sin. Even if any one sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, who is righteous."
62,2,2,"And he is an atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only but for those of the whole world."
62,2,3,"By this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commands."
62,2,4,"He who says, I know him, and does not keep his commands, is a liar and truth is not in him."
62,2,5,"But whoever keeps his word, truly in him the love of God has been made perfect. By this we know that we are in him."
62,2,6,"He who says that he is abiding in him ought himself to live as he lived."
62,2,7,"Beloved, I am not writing a new command for you, but an old command, which you have had from the beginning. The old command is the message that you have heard."
62,2,8,"Again I am writing a new command, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true Light is already shining."
62,2,9,"He who says that he is in the light and hates his brother is in darkness still."
62,2,10,"He who loves his brother remains in the light and there is no stumbling block in him."
62,2,11,"He who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness and knows not where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes."
62,2,12,"I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven for his name's sake."
62,2,13,"I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have conquered the Evil One. I have written to you, little children, because you have come to know the Father."
62,2,14,"I have written to you, fathers, because you have come to know him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong and the message of God remains in you and you have conquered the Evil One."
62,2,15,"Do not love the world nor the things that are in the world. If any one loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him;"
62,2,16,"for all that is in the world, the passions of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the show and pride of life, is not from the Father, but from the world."
62,2,17,"And the world is passing away with its passions. But he who does the will of God endures forever."
62,2,18,"Little children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that Antichrist is coming, even now many Antichrists have arisen. By this we know that it is the last hour."
62,2,19,"They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us they would have continued with us. But they went out so that it might be plainly seen that not all are of us."
62,2,20,"You have an anointing from the Holy One and you all know."
62,2,21,"I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it and know that no lie is from the truth."
62,2,22,"Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is the Antichrist who denies the Father and the Son."
62,2,23,"No one who denies the Son has the Father either. He who confesses the Son has the Father also."
62,2,24,"Let what you have heard from the beginning remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father."
62,2,25,"And this is the promise that he has promised us \'97 the life eternal."
62,2,26,"I am writing this to you in regard to those who are misleading you."
62,2,27,"But as for you, the anointing that you have received from him remains in you and you have no need for any one to teach you, but as his anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is no lie and as it has taught you, you must remain in him."
62,2,28,"And now, little children, remain in him so that if he appears we may have confidence and not shrink in shame from him at his coming."
62,2,29,"If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one who does righteousness has been born of him."
62,3,1,"SEE what love the Father has bestowed on us that we should be called children of God. And so we are. The reason why tho world does not know us is that it did not know him."
62,3,2,"Beloved, we are now children of God and it is not yet plain what we shall be. But we know that if he appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is."
62,3,3,"And every one who has this hope set upon Christ purifies himself just as Christ is pure."
62,3,4,"Every one who commits sin commits also lawlessness; for sin is lawlessness."
62,3,5,"You know that Christ appeared to take away sins and in him there is no sin."
62,3,6,"Whoever remains in him does not sin; whoever sins has not seen him nor known him."
62,3,7,"Little children, let no one deceive you. He who is doing righteousness is righteous as Christ is righteous."
62,3,8,"He who is committing sin is of the Devil, for the Devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this the Son of God appeared \'97 to undo the works of the Devil."
62,3,9,"No one who has been born of God commits sin, for God's life-giving germ remains in him and he cannot continue sinning, because he has been born of God."
62,3,10,"By this the children of God are plain to see, also the children of the Devil. Every one who is not doing righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother."
62,3,11,"For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we must love one another."
62,3,12,"Not like Cain, who was of the Wicked One and killed his brother. And for what reason did he kill him? Because his own deeds were wicked and his brother's righteous."
62,3,13,"Do not be surprised, brethren, if the world hates you."
62,3,14,"We know that we have passed from death into life because we love the brethren. Whoever does not love remains in death."
62,3,15,"Every one who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has life eternal remaining in him."
62,3,16,"By this we have come to know love \'97 that Christ laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."
62,3,17,"But if any one has this world's goods and sees his brother in need and shuts away his sympathies from him, how can the love of God remain in him?"
62,3,18,"Let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth."
62,3,19,"By this we shall know that we are of the truth and shall give confidence to our hearts in his presence,"
62,3,20,"because if our hearts condemn us God is greater than our hearts and knows all things."
62,3,21,"Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us we have confidence toward God,"
62,3,22,"and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commands and do what is pleasing in his sight."
62,3,23,"And this is his command \'97 to believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another as he has given us command."
62,3,24,"He who keeps his commands remains in God and God remains in him. By this we know that God remains in us \'97 by the Spirit which he has given to us."
62,4,1,"BELOVED, do not trust every spirit, but test the spirits whether they are from God. For many false prophets have come out into the world."
62,4,2,"By this we know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,"
62,4,3,"and no spirit that does not confess Jesus is from God. This is the spirit of Antichrist, which you have heard is coming into the world and is already in the world."
62,4,4,"But you are of God, little children, and have conquered them, because he who is in us is greater than he who is in the world."
62,4,5,"They belong to the world and for that reason they speak as the world speaks and the world listens to them."
62,4,6,"We are of God. Whoever knows God listens to us: whoever is not of God does not listen to us. In this way we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error."
62,4,7,"Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and every one who loves has been born of God and knows God."
62,4,8,"He who does not love does not know God; for God is love."
62,4,9,"By this the love of God to us was made plain: that God sent his only Son into the world so that we may have life through him."
62,4,10,"In this is love \'97 not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins."
62,4,11,"Beloved, if God has so loved us, we ought also to love one another."
62,4,12,"No one has ever seen God. If we love one another God abides in us and his love is made perfect in us."
62,4,13,"By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has imparted to us of his Spirit."
62,4,14,"We have seen and we bear witness that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world."
62,4,15,"Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God."
62,4,16,"We have come to know and have put our trust in the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God and God remains in him."
62,4,17,"Thus love has been made perfect with us so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because as God is we also are in this world."
62,4,18,"There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has pain. He who fears has not been made perfect in love."
62,4,19,"We love because he first loved us."
62,4,20,"If any one says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen."
62,4,21,"This command we have from him, that he who loves God shall love his brother also."
62,5,1,"EVERY one who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and every one who loves the father who gave him life loves every one who has received life from that father."
62,5,2,"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do his commands."
62,5,3,"For this is the love of God, our keeping his commands. And his commands are not burden-some,"
62,5,4,"because all that is born of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world, our faith."
62,5,5,"Who is the conqueror of the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?"
62,5,6,"This is he who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ. Not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the witness, because the Spirit is the truth."
62,5,7,""
62,5,8,"For there are three that bear witness, the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are in accord."
62,5,9,"If we accept the testimony of men the testimony of God is greater; for this is God's testimony, that he has testified regarding his Son."
62,5,10,"He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony within himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar; because he has not believed the testimony which God has borne regarding his Son."
62,5,11,"This is the testimony: that God has given to us life eternal and this life is in his Son."
62,5,12,"He who has the Son has life; he who has not the Son of God has not life."
62,5,13,"I am writing this to you so that you may know that you have life eternal, you who believe in the name of the Son of God."
62,5,14,"This is the confidence that we have toward him: that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us."
62,5,15,"And if we know that he hears us when we ask anything, we know that we obtain the things that we have asked of him."
62,5,16,"If any one sees his brother committing a sin that is not deadly, he must ask and God will give him life for those who are committing sin that is not deadly. There is sin that is deadly. I do not say that he should pray in behalf of that."
62,5,17,"All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin that is not deadly."
62,5,18,"We know that every one who has been born of God lives without sinning, but he who was born of God keeps him, and the Evil One does not lay hold of him."
62,5,19,"We know that we are of God and the whole world lies in the Evil One."
62,5,20,"We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding to know him who is true, and we are in him who is true and in his Son, Jesus Christ. This is the true God and life eternal."
62,5,21,"Little children, guard yourselves from idols."
63,1,1,"THE Elder to the chosen Lady and her children, whom I love in truth"
63,1,2,"for the sake of the truth which remains in us and will be with us forever:"
63,1,3,"Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."
63,1,4,"I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children living in truth, as we received command from the Father."
63,1,5,"And now I pray you, Lady, not as if writing a new command for you, but one that we have had from the beginning, let us love one another."
63,1,6,"This is love: to live by his commands. This is the command, as you heard from the beginning that you must live by it."
63,1,7,"For many deceivers have come out into the world and they do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the Antichrist."
63,1,8,"Guard yourselves so as not to lose what we have worked for, but so that you may gain a full reward."
63,1,9,"Every one who goes forward and does not remain in the teaching of Christ is without God. He who remains in the teaching, he has the Father and the Son."
63,1,10,"If any one comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house and do not bid him welcome."
63,1,11,"He who bids him welcome becomes a sharer in his wicked works."
63,1,12,"I have much to write to you, but I will not do it with paper and ink. I hope to be with you soon and to speak face to face so that our joy may be complete."
63,1,13,"The children of your chosen sister send greetings to you."
64,1,1,"THE Elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth:"
64,1,2,"Beloved, I pray that in everything you may prosper and be in health, just as your soul now prospers."
64,1,3,"For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified to your truth \'97 that you are living in the truth."
64,1,4,"I have no greater joy than this: to hear that my children are living in the truth."
64,1,5,"Beloved, you do faithfully whatever work you do for the brethren, even when they are strangers,"
64,1,6,"and they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to help them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God."
64,1,7,"For it was for the Name that they came out, taking nothing from the Gentiles."
64,1,8,"We ought to help such men so as to be fellow workers with the truth."
64,1,9,"I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who desires to be first among them, does not receive us."
64,1,10,"Therefore, if I come I will bring to mind the works that he is doing, accusing us with wicked words, and not satisfied with that, neither does he receive the brethren, and he hinders those who wish to do so and expels them from the church."
64,1,11,"Beloved, do not imitate evil, but good. He who does good is of God. He who does evil has not seen God."
64,1,12,"Testimony has been borne to Demetrius by all and by the truth itself. We too bear testimony, and you know that our testimony is true."
64,1,13,"I had much to write to you, but I will not write to you with ink and pen."
64,1,14,"But I hope to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. The friends send greetings to you. Greet the friends by name."
65,1,1,"JUDE, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, to those who are in God the Father, beloved, kept for Jesus Christ and called:"
65,1,2,"Mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you."
65,1,3,"Beloved, although I have been making every effort to write to you regarding our common salvation, I now find it necessary to write and urge you to contend vigorously for the faith that was once for all delivered to the holy."
65,1,4,"For certain persons have crept in, who of old were written of as predestined to this doom, godless, changing the grace of our God into profligacy and disowning our only Ruler and Lord, Jesus Christ."
65,1,5,"I wish to remind you, although you know all things once for all, that the Lord, after saving a people from the land of Egypt, then destroyed those who had no faith;"
65,1,6,"and angels who did not keep their own rank, but left their own abode, he has kept for the judgment of the great day in everlasting chains under blackness of darkness."
65,1,7,"So Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, which in the same way gave themselves up to unchastity and the pursuit of unnatural vices, serve as an example while they undergo the punishment of eternal fire."
65,1,8,"Just so these dreamers defile the flesh, reject government, and speak abusively of glorious beings."
65,1,9,"But Michael, the arch-angel, when in dispute with the Devil he was arguing about the body of Moses, did not venture to bring against him an abusive judgment, but said, The Lord rebuke you."
65,1,10,"But these speak profanely of whatever they do not know, and all that physically as irrational animals they do understand, in these things they corrupt themselves."
65,1,11,"Alas for them! for they have traveled in the path of Cain, and for hire have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and have perished in the rebellious talk of Korah."
65,1,12,"These are the hidden reefs in your love-feasts while they feast freely with you without fear, shepherds who care only for themselves, waterless clouds driven by winds, trees in autumn fruitless, twice dead, uprooted,"
65,1,13,"wild waves of the sea foaming out their own shame, wandering stars for which the blackness of darkness is reserved forever."
65,1,14,"Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these men when he said, See, the Lord has come with ten thousand of his holy ones"
65,1,15,"to do judgment upon all and to convict all the irreverent of all their deeds of irreverence which they have irreverently done, and of all the hard things which they have spoken against him, irreverent sinners that they are."
65,1,16,"These men are complaining grumblers, living according to their own passions, and their mouths speak great swelling words. They show admiration for persons for the sake of their own gain."
65,1,17,"But you, beloved, remember the words which were long ago spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
65,1,18,"how they told you that in the latter time there would be scoffers living according to their own ungodly passions."
65,1,19,"These are those who cause divisions, sensual and unspiritual."
65,1,20,"But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,"
65,1,21,"must keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you into life eternal."
65,1,22,"On some have pity when they are in doubt;"
65,1,23,"pull them out of the fire and save them. Others pity with fear, hating even the tunic spotted by the flesh."
65,1,24,"To him who is able to guard you from falling and to make you stand faultless before his glory in great joy,"
65,1,25,"to the only God our Savior, be, through Jesus Christ our Lord, glory, majesty, might, and authority, before all time and now and for all the ages! Amen."
66,1,1,"A REVELATION of Jesus Christ which God gave to him, to make known to his servants things which must soon take place. He sent and made it known through his angel to his servant John,"
66,1,2,"who bears witness to the message of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ \'97 everything that he saw."
66,1,3,"Blessed is he who reads, and blessed are those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep in mind what is written in it; for the time is near."
66,1,4,"John to the seven Churches in Asia: Grace be to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits that are before his throne,"
66,1,5,"and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his blood,"
66,1,6,"and made us a kingdom, priests to God his Father, to him be glory and power for the ages of the ages! Amen."
66,1,7,"He is coming with clouds and every eye will see him, even of those who pierced him, and all the tribes of the earth will beat their breasts because of him. Yes, Amen."
66,1,8,""
66,1,9,"I, John, your brother and fellow sharer in the distresses and the kingdom and the endurance in Jesus, came to the island called Patmos, for the sake of the message of God and the testimony of Jesus."
66,1,10,"I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet,"
66,1,11,"saying,"
66,1,12,"I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me, and upon turning I saw seven golden lampstands"
66,1,13,"and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed in a robe that reached his feet, and girded across the breast with a golden girdle."
66,1,14,"His head and his hair were white, like white wool, like snow, and his eyes were like a flame of fire,"
66,1,15,"and his feet were like fine brass when molten in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters."
66,1,16,"He had in his right hand seven stars, and from his mouth there issued a sharp two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in full strength."
66,1,17,"When I saw him I fell at his feet as if dead. But he laid his right hand on me and said:"

66,4,1,"AFTER this I looked and there was an open door in heaven and the voice that I had heard at first, as if of a trumpet speaking with me, said, Come up here and I will show you things that must come to pass hereafter."
66,4,2,"Immediately I became in the Spirit. A throne was standing in heaven and on the throne One was sitting."
66,4,3,"He who was sitting there was in appearance like a jasper stone and a sardius. A rainbow, in appearance like an emerald, encircled the throne."
66,4,4,"Around the throne I saw twenty-four thrones and on these thrones twenty-four elders seated, clothed in white garments and with golden crowns on their heads."
66,4,5,"From the throne issued lightnings and voices and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne. These are the seven Spirits of God."
66,4,6,"Before the throne there was as it were a glassy sea, like crystal. Near the throne and around the throne there were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind."
66,4,7,"The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man's, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle."
66,4,8,"The four living creatures have each six wings, and around and within they are full of eyes. They cease not saying day and night, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come."
66,4,9,"And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, who lives for the ages of the ages,"
66,4,10,"the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for the ages of the ages, and they cast their crowns before the throne saying,"
66,4,11,"Worthy art thou, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for thou didst create all things and because of thy will they existed and were created."
66,5,1,"THEN I saw in the right hand of him who was sitting on the throne a book with writing inside and outside and closely sealed with seven seals."
66,5,2,"I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and loose its seals?"
66,5,3,"But no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it."
66,5,4,"I wept much because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it."
66,5,5,"Then one of the elders said to me, Do not weep. The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered and can open the book and its seven seals."
66,5,6,"Then I saw midway between the throne and the four living creatures and the elders a Lamb standing. He seemed as if he had been slain. He had seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth."
66,5,7,"He came and took the book from the right hand of him who was sitting on the throne."
66,5,8,"When he took the book the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp and a golden bowl full of incense, which is the prayers of the holy."
66,5,9,"Then they sang a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book and to open its seals, for thou wast slain and didst ransom for God by thy blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation,"
66,5,10,"and hast made them a kingdom of priests to our God, and they shall be kings on the earth."
66,5,11,"Then I looked and I heard the voices of many angels encircling the throne and the voices of the four living creatures and of the elders \'97 the number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands \'97"
66,5,12,"crying aloud, Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing."
66,5,13,"And every creature that is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all creatures in them, I heard saying, To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and power for the ages of the ages."
66,5,14,"The four living creatures said, Amen, and the elders fell down and worshiped."
66,6,1,"THEN I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals and I heard one of the living creatures say, as if with a voice of thunder, Come."
66,6,2,"I looked and there came a white horse, and he who was sitting on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him and he went forth conquering and to conquer."
66,6,3,"When he opened the second seal I heard the second living creature say, Come."
66,6,4,"Then another horse came out. It was fiery red, and to him who was sitting on it was granted to take peace from the earth so that men should kill one another, and a great sword was given to him."
66,6,5,"When he opened the third seal I heard the third living creature say, Come. I looked and there came a black horse, and he who was sitting on it had a pair of scales in his hand."
66,6,6,"I heard what seemed a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a shilling and three measures of barley for a shilling. But do no harm to the oil or the wine."
66,6,7,"When he opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, Come."
66,6,8,"I looked and there came a pale yellow horse. The name of him who was sitting on it was Death, and Hades was following along with him. Authority was granted to them over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword and with famine and with pestilence and with the wild beasts of the earth."
66,6,9,"When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the sake of God's message and because of the testimony which they had borne."
66,6,10,"They cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Ruler holy and true, wilt thou delay to judge and take vengeance for our blood upon those who dwell on the earth?"
66,6,11,"To each of them a white robe was given, and it was said to them that they must wait quietly yet a little while until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren was complete, who were yet to be killed as they had been."
66,6,12,"I saw when he opened the sixth seal and there came a great earthquake and the sun became black, like sackcloth of hair, and the moon became all like blood"
66,6,13,"and the stars of heaven fell to the ground, as a fig tree drops its unripe figs when shaken by a strong wind,"
66,6,14,"and the sky passed away like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place."
66,6,15,"Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the generals and the rich and the strong and every slave and freeman hid themselves in the caves and the rocks of the mountains"
66,6,16,"and said to the mountains and the rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,"
66,6,17,"for the day, the great day, of their wrath has come and who can stand?"
66,7,1,"AFTER this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind might blow on the land or on the sea or on any tree."
66,7,2,"Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, with the seal of the living God. He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been granted to harm the land and the sea"
66,7,3,"and said, Do not harm the land or the sea or any tree until we seal the servants of our God on their foreheads."
66,7,4,"I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:"
66,7,5,"Of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed, Of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand,"
66,7,6,"Of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand,"
66,7,7,"Of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand,"
66,7,8,"Of the tribe of Zebulon, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand."
66,7,9,"After this I looked and there was a great multitude which no one could count, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb clothed in white robes and with palms in their hands,"
66,7,10,"and they shouted with a loud voice saying, Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb!"
66,7,11,"And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God"
66,7,12,"saying, Amen. Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and strength be to our God for the ages of the ages! Amen."
66,7,13,"Then one of the elders spoke to me and said, These who wear the white robes \'97 who are they and where have they come from?"
66,7,14,"I said to him, My Lord, you know. He said to me, These have come out of the great distress and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
66,7,15,"For this reason they are before the throne of God and worship him day and night in his Temple, and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them."
66,7,16,"They will not hunger any more nor thirst any more, nor will the sun strike on them nor any burning heat,"
66,7,17,"for the Lamb who is in the center before the throne will be their shepherd and will lead them to springs of living water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."
66,8,1,"WHEN he opened the seventh seal there came a silence in heaven for about half an hour."
66,8,2,"Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them."
66,8,3,"Another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and much incense was given to him for him to put with the prayers of all the holy on the golden altar before the throne."
66,8,4,"The smoke of the incense from the hand of the angel went up with the prayers of the holy before God."
66,8,5,"Then the angel took the censer and filled it from the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth, and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake."
66,8,6,"Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them."
66,8,7,"The first sounded his trumpet and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees were burned up and all green grass was burned up."
66,8,8,"The second angel sounded his trumpet and, as it were, a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood"
66,8,9,"and a third of the creatures in the sea, those that had life, died, and a third of the ships were destroyed."
66,8,10,"The third angel sounded his trumpet and there fell from heaven a great star burning like a torch. It fell upon a third of the rivers and upon the springs of water."
66,8,11,"The name of the star is called Wormwood. Then a third of the waters became worm-wood, and many people died from the waters because they had been made bitter."
66,8,12,"The fourth angel sounded his trumpet and a blight fell upon a third part of the sun and a third part of the moon and a third part of the stars, so that a third part of them was darkened, and the day had no light for a third part of it, and the night was darkened in the same way."
66,8,13,"Then I looked and I heard an eagle that was flying in mid-heaven say with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe to those who are living on the earth, because of the rest of the trumpet-blasts which the three angels are soon to sound!"
66,9,1,"THE fifth angel sounded his trumpet and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth. There was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss."
66,9,2,"And he opened the pit of the abyss and smoke came up from the pit like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun was darkened and the air also by the smoke of the pit."
66,9,3,"Out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given to them such as earthly scorpions have."
66,9,4,"It was said to them that they should not harm the grass of the earth nor anything green nor any tree, but only the people that did not have the seal of God on their foreheads."
66,9,5,"It was not granted to them to kill such, but to torment them five months. Their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it strikes a man."
66,9,6,"In those days men will seek for death and will not find it and will long to die, but death will fly from them."
66,9,7,"The appearance of the locusts was like that of horses equipped for battle. On their heads were, as it were, crowns like gold, and their faces were like human faces."
66,9,8,"They had hair like the hair of women. Their teeth were like those of lions."
66,9,9,"They had breastplates like breastplates of iron. The noise of their wings was like the noise of many-horsed chariots rushing into battle."
66,9,10,"They have tails as scorpions have, and stings, and with their tails they have power to harm men five months."
66,9,11,"They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss, whose name"
66,9,12,"One woe has passed. Two woes are still to come."
66,9,13,"The sixth angel sounded his trumpet and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar before God"
66,9,14,"saying to the sixth angel with the trumpet, Loose the four angels that are chained at the great river Euphrates."
66,9,15,"So the four angels were loosed, they who were prepared for the hour and day and month and year to kill a third of men."
66,9,16,"The number of the troops of cavalry was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number."
66,9,17,"This is how the horses and those who sat on them appeared to me in the vision: The riders had breastplates, fiery red, dark blue, and sulphur yellow. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and from their mouths came fire and smoke and sulphur."
66,9,18,"By these three plagues a third of men were killed \'97 by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur that came out of their mouths."
66,9,19,"For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents with heads, and with these they do injury."
66,9,20,"But the rest of men, who were not killed by these plagues, neither repented of the deeds of their hands nor ceased worshiping the demons and their idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk,"
66,9,21,"nor did they repent of their murders nor of their magic nor of their unchastities nor of their thefts."
66,10,1,"THEN I saw another strong angel descending from heaven. He was clothed in a cloud and the rainbow was over his head. His face was like the sun and his legs were like pillars of fire."
66,10,2,"He had in his hand a little book open. He set his right foot on the sea and his left on the land"
66,10,3,"and shouted with a loud voice like the roar of a lion. When he had shouted the seven thunders spoke, each its own message."
66,10,4,"When the seven thunders had spoken I was about to write. But I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up what the seven thunders have spoken and do not write it."
66,10,5,"Then the angel whom I had seen standing on the sea and on the land lifted his right hand to heaven"
66,10,6,"and swore by him who lives for the ages of the ages, who formed heaven and all things in it and the earth and all things upon it and the sea and all things in it, There shall be no more delay,"
66,10,7,"but in the days of the blast of the seventh angel, when he soon shall sound his trumpet, then the mystery of God has been finished, according to the good news that he gave to his servants the prophets."
66,10,8,"Then the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke again with me and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."
66,10,9,"So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little book. He said to me, Take it and eat it. It will make your stomach bitter, though in your mouth it will be sweet like honey."
66,10,10,"I took the little book from the hand of the angel and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet like honey, but after I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter."
66,10,11,"They said to me, You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings."
66,11,1,"THEN a reed like a measuring stick was given to me with the words, Rise and measure the Temple of God and the altar and those who are worshiping at it."
66,11,2,"But the court outside the Temple omit and do not measure it, for it has been given over to the Gentiles and they will trample down the holy city forty-two months."
66,11,3,"I will grant to my two witnesses to prophesy a thousand, two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth."
66,11,4,"They are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth."
66,11,5,"If any one wishes to harm them fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies. If any one shall wish to harm them, in this way he must be killed."
66,11,6,"They have power to shut up heaven so that no rain shall fall during the days that they are prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and power to smite the earth with every kind of plague as often as they please."
66,11,7,"When they have completed their testimony, the Beast that is coming up out of the abyss will make war with them and conquer them and kill them."
66,11,8,"Their corpses will lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified."
66,11,9,"Men of all peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their corpses three days and a half and will not permit their corpses to be placed in a tomb."
66,11,10,"Those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and send gifts to one another, because the two prophets tormented those who live on the earth."
66,11,11,"After the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them and they stood on their feet. Then great fear fell on those who were looking at them."
66,11,12,"They heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, Come up here, and they went up into heaven in the cloud while their enemies were looking at them."
66,11,13,"At that hour occurred a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell and seven thousand men were killed by the earthquake. The rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven."
66,11,14,"The second Woe has passed: the third Woe will come soon."
66,11,15,"The seventh angel sounded his trumpet and there came loud voices in heaven saying, The kingship of the world has become our Lord's and his Christ's and he will be king for the ages of the ages."
66,11,16,"Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God,"
66,11,17,"saying, We thank thee, Lord God Almighty, who art and wast, that thou hast taken thy great power and hast become king."
66,11,18,"The Gentiles raged, but thy wrath came and the time to judge the dead and to give the reward to thy servants the prophets and to the holy who reverence thy name, the small and the great, and to destroy those who are destroying the earth."
66,11,19,"Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant in his temple was seen in his temple, and there came lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and a great hailstorm."
66,12,1,"A GREAT sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun. The moon was under her feet and on her head was a crown of twelve stars."
66,12,2,"She was with child and cried out in the pangs and anguish of child-birth."
66,12,3,"There appeared also another sign in heaven, a great fiery-red Dragon with seven heads and ten horns. On his heads were seven diadems"
66,12,4,"and his tail dragged a third of the stars of heaven and hurled them to the ground. The Dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth to a child, so that he might devour the child as soon as it was born."
66,12,5,"She gave birth to a son who is to shepherd all the nations with a rod of iron. Then the child was caught up to God and to his throne."
66,12,6,"The woman fled into the wilderness where she has from God a prepared place, that they may nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days."
66,12,7,"War arose in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the Dragon. The Dragon and his angels fought,"
66,12,8,"but they failed, and no place was found for them any longer in heaven."
66,12,9,"Then was hurled down the great Dragon, the ancient serpent who is called the Devil and Satan, who misleads the whole world \'97 he was hurled to the earth and his angels were hurled with him."
66,12,10,"I heard a loud voice in heaven say, Now has come the salvation and power and kingship of our God and the authority of his Christ, because the accuser of our brethren has been hurled down, he who accuses them before our God day and night."
66,12,11,"But they have conquered him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of testimony to him, and they loved not their lives even to death."
66,12,12,"Therefore, rejoice, O heavens, and you who tent in them! Alas for the land and the sea! For the Devil has gone down to you in great wrath, knowing that he has but a little time."
66,12,13,"When the Dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth he pursued the woman who had given birth to the man-child."
66,12,14,"Then there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle to fly into the wilderness to her place, where she shall be fed for a time and times and half a time, hidden from the view of the Serpent."
66,12,15,"The Serpent poured from his mouth after the woman water like a river, to sweep her away with a flood."
66,12,16,"But the earth helped the woman and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river that the Dragon had poured out of his mouth."
66,12,17,"Then the Dragon was enraged against the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her offspring who keep the commands of God and hold the testimony concerning Jesus."
66,13,1,"THEN I stood on the sand of the sea and I saw rising out of the sea a Beast with ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten diadems and upon his heads were profane names."
66,13,2,"The Beast that I saw was like a leopard, but his feet were like a bear's feet and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The Dragon gave to him his own power and his throne and great authority."
66,13,3,"I saw one of his heads, as it were, mortally wounded, but the mortal wound was healed. The whole world followed the Beast in amazement,"
66,13,4,"and they worshiped the Dragon because he had given such power to the Beast, and they worshiped the Beast, saying, Who is like the Beast, and who can battle with him?"
66,13,5,"There was given to him a mouth speaking boasts and profanities, and there was given to him power to act for forty-two months."
66,13,6,"He opened his mouth to insult God, to speak profanely of his name and of his Tent and of those who tent in heaven."
66,13,7,"It was granted to the Beast to make war with the holy and to conquer them, and power was granted to him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation."
66,13,8,"All the inhabitants of the earth will worship him, all whose names have not been written from the foundation of the world in the slain Iamb's Book of Life."
66,13,9,"If any one has an ear let him hear."
66,13,10,"If any one is destined to captivity, into captivity he will go. If any one is to be killed by the sword, by the sword must he be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the holy."
66,13,11,"Then I saw another Beast coming up out of the land. It had two horns like those of a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon."
66,13,12,"It exercises all the authority of the first Beast in his presence. It compels the earth and its inhabitants to worship the first Beast whose mortal wound was healed."
66,13,13,"It does great signs, making fire descend from heaven to earth in the sight of men."
66,13,14,"It leads astray the inhabitants of the earth because of the signs which it has been granted power to do in the presence of the Beast. It tells the inhabitants of the earth to make an image of the Beast which was wounded by the sword, yet lived."
66,13,15,"Power was granted to it to give breath to the image of the Beast, so that the image of the Beast spoke and it caused all who did not worship the image of the Beast to be put to death."
66,13,16,"It causes all, small and great, rich and poor, freemen and slaves, to have a mark put on their right hands or on their foreheads,"
66,13,17,"so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark \'97 the name of the Beast or the number of his name."
66,13,18,"Here wisdom is required. Let him who has understanding count the number of the Beast; for it is the number of a man. His number is six hundred and sixty-six."
66,14,1,"THEN I looked and there was a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand who had his name and the name of his Father written on their fore-heads."
66,14,2,"I heard a sound from heaven like the sound of many waters, like the sound of loud thunder. The sound that I heard was as of harpers playing on their harps."
66,14,3,"They sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been ransomed from the earth."
66,14,4,"These are they who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were ransomed from among men as first-fruits for God and the Lamb."
66,14,5,"No lie was found in their mouths. They are stainless."
66,14,6,"Then I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven having eternal good news to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation and tribe and tongue and people."
66,14,7,"He said in a loud voice, Reverence God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment has come, and worship him who made heaven and earth and sea and springs of water."
66,14,8,"Another angel, a second, followed, saying, Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen, she who has made all the nations drink of the wine of her passion for unchastity."
66,14,9,"Another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a loud voice, If any one worships the Beast and his image and receives his mark on his forehead and on his hand,"
66,14,10,"he also will drink of the wine of God's passion which has been mixed undiluted in the cup of his wrath, and he will be tortured in fire and brimstone in the presence of holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb."
66,14,11,"And the smoke of their torture will ascend for ages of ages and they will have no rest day or night \'97 those who worship the Beast and his image, and any one who receives the mark of his name."
66,14,12,"Here is the endurance of the holy who keep the commands of God and the faith of Jesus."
66,14,13,"Then I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord henceforth. Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their toils. For their works follow with them."
66,14,14,"Then I looked and there was a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud was one like a son of man. He had on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle."
66,14,15,"Another angel came out of the Temple and shouted with a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, Thrust in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is dry."
66,14,16,"He who was sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth and the earth was reaped."
66,14,17,"Then another angel came out from the Temple that is in heaven and he too had a sharp sickle."
66,14,18,"Another angel came out from the altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are fully ripe."
66,14,19,"Then the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered the vintage of the earth and flung it into the great winepress of the wrath of God."
66,14,20,"The winepress was trodden outside the city and blood came out from the wine-press as high as the horses' bridles for a thousand and six hundred furlongs."
66,15,1,"THEN I saw another sign in heaven. It was great and wonderful \'97 seven angels with the seven plagues which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is fully executed."
66,15,2,"Then I saw what was like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had come victorious from the Beast and his image and the number of his name standing by the glassy sea with harps of God."
66,15,3,"They were singing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying: Great and wonderful are thy works, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are thy ways, O King of the nations."
66,15,4,"Who will not reverence and glorify thy name, O Lord? For thou only art holy. All the nations will come and worship before thee, because thy righteous acts have been made manifest."
66,15,5,"After this I looked and the Temple of the Tent of testimony in heaven was opened,"
66,15,6,"and the seven angels with the seven last plagues came out of the Temple, clothed in pure shining linen and girded around their breasts with golden girdles."
66,15,7,"One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God who lives for the ages of the ages."
66,15,8,"The Temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the Temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished."
66,16,1,"THEN I heard a loud voice saying from the Temple to the seven angels, Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God upon the earth."
66,16,2,"The first went away and poured his bowl upon the land, and there came an evil and malignant ulcer on the men who had the mark of the Beast and those who worshiped its image."
66,16,3,"The second angel poured out his bowl upon the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man and every living thing that was in the sea died."
66,16,4,"The third angel poured out his bowl upon the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood."
66,16,5,"Then I heard the angel of the waters saying, Just art thou who art and wast, the Holy One, because thou hast so judged,"
66,16,6,"for they poured out the blood of thy holy ones and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink. They deserve it."
66,16,7,"Then I heard the altar saying, Yes, O Lord God Almighty, true and just are thy judgments."
66,16,8,"The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was granted to him to scorch men with fire."
66,16,9,"Men were scorched with great heat and they insulted the name of God who had power over these plagues, but they did not repent and give him glory."
66,16,10,"The fifth angel poured out his bowl upon the throne of the Beast, and his kingdom became darkened and men bit their tongues from pain"
66,16,11,"and insulted the God of heaven for their pains and their ulcers, but they did not repent of their deeds."
66,16,12,"The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to make a road ready for the kings from the sunrising."
66,16,13,"Then I saw come out of the mouth of the Dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast and out of the mouth of the False Prophet three impure spirits like frogs."
66,16,14,"They are the spirits of demons who work miracles, and they go forth to the kings of the whole habitable world to gather them for the battle of the great day of God the Almighty."
66,16,15,""
66,16,16,"The spirits gathered them to the place called in Hebrew Har-Magedon."
66,16,17,"The seventh angel poured out his bowl on the air, and a loud voice came from the Temple, from the throne, saying, It is done!"
66,16,18,"Then came lightnings and voices and thunders and a great earthquake. So great an earthquake has not occurred since man came upon the earth."
66,16,19,"The great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the Gentiles fell. Then Babylon the Great was remembered before God \'97 to give to her the cup of the wine of his fierce wrath."
66,16,20,"Every island fled and the mountains were not found."
66,16,21,"And great hailstones each weighing about a hundred pounds fell from heaven on men. Men insulted God because of the hail, for the plague of it was great."
66,17,1,"THEN came one of the seven angels that had the seven plagues and spoke with me. He said, Come here. I will show you the doom of the great prostitute who sits on many waters"
66,17,2,"and with whom the kings of the earth have committed lewdness, while the inhabitants of the earth have become drunk with the wine of her lewdness."
66,17,3,"He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast covered with profane names, and with seven heads and ten horns."
66,17,4,"The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls. She had in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her lewdness."
66,17,5,"On her forehead was written a mysterious name: Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth."
66,17,6,"I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the holy and with the blood of the witnesses for Jesus. When I saw her I wondered greatly."
66,17,7,"The angel said to me, Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystic meaning of the woman and the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her."
66,17,8,"The Beast which you saw was and is not and will soon come up out of the abyss and go into destruction. And the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written from the foundation of the world in the Book of Life will be amazed when they see the Beast that was and is not and will be."
66,17,9,"Here is need for a mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains upon which the woman sits."
66,17,10,"Also they are seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he comes he must stay but a little while."
66,17,11,"The Beast which was and is not is also himself an eighth, yet is one of the seven, and will go into destruction."
66,17,12,"The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received kingly power, but they will receive power as kings for one hour with the Beast."
66,17,13,"They have one mind and they give over their power and authority to the Beast."
66,17,14,"They will make war with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings. They who are with him, called and chosen and faithful, will also conquer."
66,17,15,"He said to me, The waters that you saw where the prostitute was sitting are peoples and crowds and nations and tongues."
66,17,16,"The ten horns that you saw and the Beast \'97 they hate the prostitute and will make her desolate and naked and they will devour her flesh and will burn her up with fire."
66,17,17,"For God has put it in their hearts to carry out his purpose, which is that they shall carry out one purpose and give their royal power to the Beast until the words of God are fulfilled."
66,17,18,"The woman that you saw is the great city that has kingly power over the kings of the earth."
66,18,1,"AFTER this I saw another angel descending from heaven with great power, and the earth was lit up with his splendor."
66,18,2,"He shouted with a powerful voice, saying, Babylon the Great has fallen, has fallen, and has become a habitation of demons and a stronghold of every impure spirit and a stronghold of every unclean and detested bird."
66,18,3,"For all the nations have drunk of the wine of her passion for lewdness and the kings of the earth have committed lewdness with her and by the excess of her luxury the merchants of the earth have grown rich."
66,18,4,"Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, Come out of her, my people, that you may not take part in her sins nor receive a share in her plagues,"
66,18,5,"for her sins have been heaped up to heaven and God has remembered her unrighteous deeds."
66,18,6,"Repay to her as she has paid, and make it double for her deeds. In the cup she mixed mix double for her."
66,18,7,"As much as she glorified herself and played the wanton, so much give her torture and woe. For in her heart she says, 'I sit here a queen; no widow am I and woe I shall not see.'"
66,18,8,"For this reason in one day her plagues will come, death and woe and famine, and she shall be burned up in fire. For strong is the Lord God who has judged her."
66,18,9,"The kings of the earth who have committed lewdness with her and have reveled luxuriously, when they see the smoke of her burning, will wail and beat their breasts."
66,18,10,"Standing afar because of their dismay at her torture, they will say, 'Alas, alas, O great city, Babylon the strong city, for in one hour your doom has come!'"
66,18,11,"The merchants of the earth will weep and wail over her, for no one will any longer buy their cargoes,"
66,18,12,"cargoes of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, all kinds of citrus wood and their many kinds of articles of ivory and their many kinds of articles of costliest wood and brass and iron and marble,"
66,18,13,"and cinnamon and spice and incense and ointment and frankincense and wine, and olive oil and fine flour and wheat, and cattle and sheep and horses and chariots, and bodies and souls of men."
66,18,14,"The ripe fruits for which your soul longed have gone from you, and all your dainty and splendid things are lost to you and they will never more be found."
66,18,15,"The traders in these things who grew rich from her will stand afar through dismay at her torture, weeping and wailing"
66,18,16,"and saying: 'Alas, alas, for the great city, clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!"
66,18,17,"For in one hour this vast wealth has given place to desolation.'  Every ship captain and every one who sails anywhere, and sailors and all who gain their living on the sea, stood afar"
66,18,18,"and shouted as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city could compare with the great city?"
66,18,19,"They threw dust upon their heads and shouted as they wept and wailed, saying, Alas, alas, for the great city in which all who had ships on the sea grew rich from her wealth! For in an hour she has been desolated."
66,18,20,"Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you the holy and you apostles and prophets! For God has pronounced sentence in your behalf against her."
66,18,21,"Then one strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and hurled it into the sea, saying, With such violence shall Babylon the great city be hurled down and she will never more be found."
66,18,22,"The music of harpers and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters will never more be heard in you. No master of any art will ever more be found in you. The sound of the mill will never more be heard in you."
66,18,23,"The light of a lamp will never more shine in you. The voices of bridegroom and bride will never again be heard in you. Your merchants were the great ones of the earth; for by your magic arts all the nations were led astray."
66,18,24,"In her was found the blood of prophets and of holy men and of all who had been slain on the earth."
66,19,1,"AFTER this I heard what seemed the loud voices of a great multitude in heaven saying, Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,"
66,19,2,"for true and just are his judgments. He has judged the great prostitute who was corrupting the earth with her lewdness and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants."
66,19,3,"Again they shouted, Hallelujah! Her smoke will ascend for the ages of the ages."
66,19,4,"Then the twenty-four elders fell down and the four living creatures worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, Amen! Hallelujah!"
66,19,5,"A voice came from the throne saying, Praise our God, all of you his servants who reverence him, both small and great."
66,19,6,"Then I heard what seemed like the voices of a great multitude, like the sound of many waters, like the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty is king."
66,19,7,"Let us rejoice and be glad and give glory to him; for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his bride has prepared herself"
66,19,8,"and it has been granted to her to be clothed in fine linen shining and pure. For the fine linen is the righteous acts of the holy."
66,19,9,"Then he said to me, Write: Blessed are they who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb! He said to me, These are the true words of God."
66,19,10,"Then I fell down at his feet and worshiped him. But he said to me, No, no. I am a fellow servant of yours and of your brethren who hold the testimony to Jesus. Worship God. For testimony to Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
66,19,11,"Then I saw heaven open and there was a white horse, and he who was sitting on it was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war."
66,19,12,"His eyes are a flame of fire and on his head are many diadems. He has a name written which no one but himself knows,"
66,19,13,"and he is clothed in a garment dipped in blood and his name has been called The Word of God."
66,19,14,"The armies that are in heaven follow him on white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean."
66,19,15,"From his mouth issues a sharp sword to smite the nations. He will shepherd them with a rod of iron, and he treads the winepress of the fierce wrath of God Almighty."
66,19,16,"He has on his robe and on his thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords."
66,19,17,"Then I saw one angel standing on the sun, and he shouted with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come, gather for the great feast of God,"
66,19,18,"to eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of generals and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of freemen and of slaves, of small and great."
66,19,19,"Then I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered to do battle with him who sits on the horse and with his army."
66,19,20,"And the Beast was captured and with him the False Prophet who did miracles in his presence and thereby misled those who received the mark of the Beast and who worshiped his image. The two were flung alive into the lake of fire that burns with brimstone."
66,19,21,"The rest were slain with the sword of him who sits upon the horse, the sword that issued from his mouth, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh."
66,20,1,"THEN I saw an angel descending from heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand."
66,20,2,"He laid hold of the Dragon, the ancient Serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and chained him for a thousand years"
66,20,3,"and flung him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he should not mislead the nations until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be loosed for a little while."
66,20,4,"Then I saw thrones, and men took their seats on them and the power to judge was granted to them. I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus and for God's message, and who had not worshiped the Beast nor his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. They lived and reigned as kings with Christ a thousand years,"
66,20,5,"but the rest of the dead did not return to life until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection."
66,20,6,"Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection! Over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests and kings of God and of Christ, and will reign with him the thousand years."
66,20,7,"When the thousand years are ended, Satan will be loosed from his prison"
66,20,8,"and will come out to mislead the nations that are at the four corners of the earth \'97 Gog and Magog \'97 and gather them to battle in number like the sand of the sea."
66,20,9,"They went up over the breadth of the earth and encircled the camp of the holy and the beloved city. But fire fell from heaven and consumed them,"
66,20,10,"and the Devil who was misleading them was flung into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the Beast and the False Prophet, and they will be tormented day and night for the ages of the ages."
66,20,11,"Then I saw a great white throne and him who was sitting on it, from whose face earth and heaven fled away and no place was found for them."
66,20,12,"And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. And another book was opened which is the Book of Life. The dead were judged out of what was written in the books according to their deeds."
66,20,13,"The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and they were judged each according to his deeds."
66,20,14,"Death and Hades were flung into the lake of fire. This is the second death \'97 the lake of fire."
66,20,15,"If any one was not found written in the Book of Life he was flung into the lake of fire."
66,21,1,"THEN I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more."
66,21,2,"I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."
66,21,3,"And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, The Tent of God is with men. He will tent with them and they will be his people and he will be their God."
66,21,4,"He will wipe every tear from their eyes. Death shall be no more; neither shall there any longer be sorrow or wailing or painful toil; for the first things have passed away."
66,21,5,"He who was sitting on the throne said, See, I am making all things new. He said, Write; for these words are trustworthy and true."
66,21,6,"He said to me, They have come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To him who is thirsting I will give from the spring of the water of life freely."
66,21,7,"He who conquers shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be to me a son."
66,21,8,"But the timid and faithless and abominable and murderers and the unchaste and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars will have their lot in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
66,21,9,"Then one of the angels that had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came and spoke with me. Come here, he said, and I will show you the Bride, the Lamb's wife."
66,21,10,"Then he carried me in Spirit to the top of a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God,"
66,21,11,"having the glory of God. Her brilliance was like that of a most precious stone, like crystalline jasper."
66,21,12,"She had a wall great and high, and she had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels, and there were names written upon the gates. They are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel."
66,21,13,"On the east were three gates and on the north three gates and on the south three gates and on the west three gates."
66,21,14,"The wall of the city had twelve foundations and upon them were twelve names, the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
66,21,15,"He who was speaking with me had a golden reed as a measure, to measure the city and her gates and her wall."
66,21,16,"The city stands foursquare and the length is the same as the breadth. He measured the city with the reed. It extends twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal."
66,21,17,"He measured the wall of it, a hundred and forty-four cubits by human measure, which is also that of an angel."
66,21,18,"The material of the wall of it was jasper and the city was pure gold like clear glass."
66,21,19,"The foundations of the wall of the city were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,"
66,21,20,"the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst."
66,21,21,"The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each one of the gates was of one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold like transparent glass."
66,21,22,"I saw no temple in it; for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb."
66,21,23,"And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it; for the glory of God illumines it and the Lamb is its light."
66,21,24,"The nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it,"
66,21,25,"and its gates will not be closed by day, and there will be no night there."
66,21,26,"They will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it."
66,21,27,"But there will not enter into it anything unholy or any one who makes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life."
66,22,1,"THEN he showed me a river of water of life bright as crystal, issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb."
66,22,2,"In the space between the street and the river, on this side and on that, grew trees of life bearing twelve kinds of fruit, and yielding their fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."
66,22,3,"There will no longer be any accursed thing. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it and his servants will worship him with holy rites."
66,22,4,"They will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads."
66,22,5,"There will not be night any more and they will have no need of lamplight or of sunlight; for the Lord God will shine upon them and they will be kings for the ages of the ages."
66,22,6,"Then he said to me, These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord God of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to show to his servants what must soon come to pass."
66,22,7,""
